00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,840: she'd and Rosie doesn't know why walnut

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:23,070: whole thing like it's a paragraph it's
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:25,799: just like my dearest walnut it is with
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,480: deepest sorrow that I and it just keeps
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,579: going and going and going she's bored
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,769: she's like I'm making all the guesses
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,139: about what I could have said but it
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:37,199: obviously took a long time because it's
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,840: all cross stitch and then the one for
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:49,259: Chris whom she called an esoteric
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:57,320: lunatic it just says Happy Holidays this
00:09:49,259 --> 00:10:02,009: is the perfect gift has everything so
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,890: auspicious drawn after a low these two
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:09,620: weeks as I said is has begun to regain
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:14,490: her strength she's filling out on the
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:17,070: unseasonable produced cornerstones there
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,279: is there is more or less an endless
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:23,850: stream of cornerstones now that people
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,559: are coming from cities around the
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,409: drawing Cordier to experience this
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:31,439: keulen Airy delight but there's also the
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:34,589: fact that there's there's an attenuation
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,350: that's occurring where prophetess has
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,810: not been able to feed her child for
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,659: decades and you get the sense that she
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:46,369: is making up for lost time and it's just
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:48,990: an endless parade of childhood favorites
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,269: it's an absolute it's an absolute
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,860: delight occasionally there are
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:56,699: remainders that can be taken advantage
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:59,789: of but auspicious is basically taken on
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,009: a sort of like lieutenant role in the
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:05,250: drone and courtier there's always a
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:06,779: broom at the ready there's a lot of
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,570: sweeping even when sweeping is not
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:12,179: necessarily required she's in that phase
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:15,740: where she is sweeping clean floors she's
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:15,739: gonna find new floors beneath
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:21,938: when when folks come in there's a big
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:23,469: smile and she greets them and then
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:30,219: people look over at profit and profit
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:33,550: nods gently that's quick yeah that's
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,559: great there's more okay oh oh there's
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:36,669: more advice well there's the end what

00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,469: but he anticipates any time he feels you
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,068: sort of like tightening and flexing to

00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:22,600: there's a couple sweeps and then like
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,758: she's raised the broom toward the corner
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,620: and then there's a couple more tent you
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,220: know sort of tenuous sweep around the
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:34,190: edge we both have our eye on
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:37,970: unlike the last hors d'oeuvre dark
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:43,580: corners huh that's a favorite of mine

00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:09,800: again she smiles and then her her eyes
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:14,299: closed for a second and the smile melts
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:17,899: away and then she takes up the broom and
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:20,929: supports herself with it and sort of
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:24,259: almost leans into the leaves into the
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:26,959: edge of the wall there in the corner
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:31,549: for support and then when she looks down
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:34,040: at you there's no trace of the mirth and
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:40,269: she looks directly into your eyes and
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:44,139: says she's hurt she's hurt she's hurt
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:47,509: who you need to help her who is hurt she
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:52,189: collapses into the corner where you are
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:55,519: physically I catch her she is just like
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:58,100: a sack just like a sack of potatoes you
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,720: can just transfer her down into the
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:06,230: corner with no loss of momentum at all
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:17,149: okay yeah
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:21,490: profile is this where you have to do it
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:25,159: now on the right in the eye
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,000: please yeah hurry your daughter yeah
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:30,049: exactly

00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:35,209: as well she looks over into the corner
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:37,100: and rushes into it it is at that moment
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:40,700: that the front door of the drowning
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,710: courtier swings wide
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,400: and because this is the drawn-in
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:50,780: courtier it's customary for mugs to be
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,600: raised the patrons cheer as an elven
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:55,279: woman enters people quickly return to
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,490: their drinks their meals in the town
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,689: gossip the thrives in places like this
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,480: but you can't take your eyes off the
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,610: newcomer still framed by the door she
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,129: seems to be scanning the room looking
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,129: for someone but her eyes never rest in
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:13,970: any one place she clutches the bundle at
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:16,100: her chest even tighter a couple of
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:20,779: shuffling steps later she collapses on
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:26,000: the nearest table yours the back of her
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:27,679: tunic is black with rain and blood mugs
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,330: clatter to the floorboards I have a very
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:33,649: unique idea about what constitutes a
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:35,450: Christmas adventure mugs clatter to the
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:38,120: floorboards their contents pooling and
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:40,400: running through the cracks she looks
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,490: into the bundle or appears to but
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,669: there's no light in her eyes inside this
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:49,730: nest of rags a baby peeks out without
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:52,219: understanding her tiny face is encircled
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,340: by blonde curls she is the spitting
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:59,720: image of the elf who carried her she's
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:03,530: on my table I've taken it back for a
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,390: moment and then I am I rushed to this I
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:06,799: put my hands on itself it's like it's

00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:31,219: no fewer than six distinct rents in the
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:34,670: back of this cloak stab wounds that's
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,370: your guess okay and this but the baby's

00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:06,740: indicates that she's able to comprehend
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:09,079: this prophetess and auspicious are in a

00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:12,589: drowning courtier there is a recognition
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:15,350: that provinces new guests are adept at
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:19,369: problem solving the issue that you have
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:22,339: presently is that more customers are
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:25,969: coming in well in fact you can see them
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:29,720: moving in front of the like the warm
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:33,829: glow that the DNC casts out into the

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:42,798: predatory and what's odd is that the
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,109: shape that you see as they pass the
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:50,058: window is not the shape that you see

00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,109: sort of person that you might interact
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:05,480: with in a positive way and not like the
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:09,859: sort of gangly elongated shapes that you
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:14,058: saw pass and they enter and their
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:17,269: clothing is not slick with the rain as
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:22,928: they enter the room they look freshly

00:21:54,079 --> 00:22:03,470: similar raiment okay it's a combination
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:06,649: of red and black leather straps and they
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:11,298: are armed not over much for the road but

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:09,450: daggers come out they the limbs extend
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,529: you would suspect three to four inches
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:16,140: okay
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:19,410: they are sort of loose and languid in a
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,660: way their language okay their language
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:24,900: is with their language after their long
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:27,029: and they're using daggers cool I would
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,910: like all of them to do a strength saving
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:33,569: throw what are we doing here walnut die
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:35,009: cast entangle on the group oh I don't
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:37,169: like where this is going and I don't
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:40,379: like when I don't like anything about
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,480: this yeah this sucks oh this is great so

00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,759: yeah I must protect well strength is a
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,289: pretty good one for them to go after so
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,490: that's pretty solid you did say they
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:55,490: were lying they say there's four of them
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:59,909: three of them save but one of them is
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:04,379: one of them is trapped okay you can you
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:07,019: can you can recall profit front perhaps
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,180: a week and a half ago clipping away the
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:12,150: rest of the hop vines from the trellis
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:15,330: out front and instantly fresh green
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,509: shoots come in straight under the door
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:20,279: and then reach halfway up one of these
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:22,379: targets tank
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,299: grass so that one just so for everyone
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,480: to know anyone restrained by these
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:29,909: plants hops gonna make a heck of a beer
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,250: later need to make a strength to check
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,850: against my spell save DC for their whole
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,659: action
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:37,509: what's Rudy see
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:40,149: a thing that I will find thank you when
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:42,009: it's its turn an integer 14 here 14
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:44,819: right and then entangle just for the
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:47,288: folks at home tell me what that does
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:49,898: grasping weeds and vines sprout from the
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:51,999: ground in a 20 foot square starting from
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:53,319: a point within range whoops for the
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,659: duration of these plants turn the ground
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,118: area into difficult terrain so I guess
00:26:55,659 --> 00:27:00,070: even if they save it's still difficult
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:01,148: terrain yeah so they can pull around but
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:04,450: it's very difficult for them to maneuver
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:06,488: in here so for a very brief period that
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:11,019: drownin courtier has been reclaimed by
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:14,369: the wood absolutely looks nice
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:17,798: alright so you have done that grasping
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:20,678: vines and plants are reaching in Denard
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:21,999: Blitzen you know there's four of these
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,639: a-holes
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:28,149: there's four in one's tangled occupied
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:30,278: oh yeah one of them's got a grip and
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:33,579: they're totally tugging there
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:35,048: weirdly long limbs trying to maneuver
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:37,329: through this space what are they wearing
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:38,798: are they armored up yeah it's this
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:42,970: leather armor but they are armored yes
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:47,069: okay uh I was upstairs saying before I
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:50,048: took a sleeping no I was in our office
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:53,378: framing the crocheted thing that said
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:59,710: I'm not a baby like a diploma like a
00:27:53,378 --> 00:28:01,118: point to it like I'm not a baby comes
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,470: out yeah if it ever comes to bring
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:06,638: someone wardroom
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:09,089: I got it in writing ish so I come out
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:12,998: and I catch the tail end of all this
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:14,918: dead body baby people make any case to
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:19,229: murder baby typical Wednesday and I was
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:21,340: like whomp whomp back to bed no I go
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:27,989: they haven't made a compelling case to
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:31,959: murder that baby so I will command
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:33,399: because I feeling like metagaming this a
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,679: little bit probably be harder to hit the
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:37,628: leader so I'll hit of the of the three
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,999: remaining I'll go after two of the
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:42,639: flunkies with command and I'll say
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:45,039: disrobe
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,600: nice yeah then I gotta take a turn
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,339: taking all their clothes off and
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,289: dropping their weapons that's a safe you
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:53,279: want to murder that baby Megan naked
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:58,389: '[Laughter]'
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:03,940: Christmas so what do we what do they
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:08,800: save against for that Kamandi Oh 14 my
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:12,670: LD say 14 no just this place just got a
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:18,069: lot hotter nah weapons first make me
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:20,110: forget my troubles it's gone it got
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:22,529: really heavy in here nope let's lighten
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:29,639: the mood so their their faces are still
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:34,450: Stern and angry and they have a sort of
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,150: like an evil sort of like like they kill
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:40,569: for sport like cats like their their
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:44,100: body language is just is unpleasant but
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:46,419: they've managed to retain the facial
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:51,119: expression that would communicate this
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:53,860: while stripping off all of their armor
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:57,279: so but they're still very defiant yeah
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:58,689: but they have a lot less clothes on now
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,039: so that was a but that was able to get a
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,259: hold of two of them they were they both
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,399: fucked that up
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:05,740: they have to do that for the full turn -
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,690: so no no no yeah yeah exactly but they
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,089: but they mean it like they're there
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:11,680: they've managed to discover a way to
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:16,359: remove their clothes that still seems
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:19,660: dangerous somehow if they remove their
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:22,859: clothes with lethal precision yeah oh
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,860: yeah you think so
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:30,009: so the other the other two have
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,650: immediately begun and they are not they
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:35,289: are not approaching the party or the
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,660: environment in a tactical way they have
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:38,859: a very specific intention so you work
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,259: you are holding this child yeah
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:44,469: absolutely you are the only thing they
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:46,019: care about okay in this world apparently
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,799: Wow
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:55,019: now what's your AC 16
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:57,359: okay you are struck by a dagger and you
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:01,379: are struck by another dagger so they
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:03,179: descend upon you in a way that almost
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,030: looks as though there's a single
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:10,920: intellect like these these are creatures
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:13,230: that that hunt with regularity and they
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,110: give each other space so they can be
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:18,360: very very close to you and not get in
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:20,339: each other's way they just sort of bend
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:24,750: and flow around each other and then
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:27,839: knives are coming out of this this these
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:29,430: waving limbs just out of this cloud it's
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,289: like it's like the cartoon version of a
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,029: fight where it's just a cloud and then
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:40,909: occasionally limbs are emerging right
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:40,910: it's like that except it's nice yeah
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:51,140: that's 18 okay so ten and eight okay so
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,289: lethal precision but here's the deal
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:57,300: they are not trying to stab you at all
00:31:54,289 --> 00:32:01,019: well they did a real bad job then no
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:06,089: they are literally trying to kill the
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:11,069: child and when that dagger goes into
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:12,569: this nest of rags you feel it oh wait so
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:14,460: there there's that they're actually
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:17,009: stabbing the baby I'm not even able to
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,920: protect it no no they go right for the
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:24,960: child but when that dagger intersects
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:27,930: with this nest of rags you feel the pain
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,700: okay oh okay and I take the damage you
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,509: take the damage exactly right okay
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:36,240: there's something about this swaddle
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:41,359: that is not Babies R Us there's a unique
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:45,180: quality to it okay rosy bee stinger okay
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:47,729: so I I'm holding this child you are I'm
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:51,539: not going to be able to use my hands at
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:59,720: all which sucks for me use one hand one
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:59,720: hand I don't think I need it so good
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:07,980: four foot but my I I believe my own arm
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,900: strikes are a bonus section that I can
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,559: only take after I take a staff attack
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,330: correct
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,169: that's Sherman that I learned the hard
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:23,419: way so what I'm going to do then would
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:28,860: be I think what I'm gonna do is command
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:32,430: I'm going to use my commands to command
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:44,029: that the one attacking me that's closest
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:49,710: to disrobe it's a good gear yeah yeah
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:53,399: yes yeah my cc's 13 oh no no no they did
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:57,809: not do well so so immediately this was

00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:08,669: too close and the body beneath it has
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,130: none of the characteristics you would
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:12,929: expect I narrow my eyes and I it's not
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:17,849: it's not a nice face I make but I go

00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:51,199: Joey auto hits oh you get a free 1007
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:57,670: plus 8 15 yes that's quite good
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:57,669: give me the damage from its jack jacked
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:05,340: be three reroll two - I have to take the
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:07,679: second one
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:12,210: so that's five and then I'll smite him -
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:14,250: okay I don't think I get to re-roll the
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:18,179: damage on the smites okay someone can't
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:30,750: correct me if I do Wow
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:34,169: so so you you slash straight across the
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:37,590: back there's no armor plate and almost
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:40,889: immediately you can see like you make a
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:44,130: slash and then the slash itself like a
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:47,639: second later fills up across the back so
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:50,570: this entity stumbles as a result of the
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:54,690: hit and the smite but then continues to
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:58,769: doggedly pursue Rosie be stinger - to

00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:02,670: right here we go

00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:39,809: picture that's an additional 16 points
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:44,010: or is EB 505 huge just yeah deep deep

00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:30,239: around this bundle in the hopes that
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:31,349: they'll just keep stabbing me instead
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:32,788: because I'm dead already

00:50:55,699 --> 00:51:00,889: rod immediately is sort of like
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:06,550: elastically sort of like snaps into his
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:09,440: shorter length and he hits the floor and
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:12,310: you can see that the dagger point that
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:16,309: is in the end of the staff is now held

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:28,009: Rosie and then coils around the child
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:30,829: and then moves like a spring the child
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:35,320: sort of like held in the middle of this
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:38,449: coil while it travels across the room

00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:53,689: phenomenon and you can see you can see
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:56,269: thee you can see the creature

01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,670: about the Royal changeling are about
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:09,269: them giving their lives to heal
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:11,670: lycanthropy like they show up it's like

01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:38,640: to no end to get it well Rosie looks
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:41,369: down this baby who I believe is adorable

01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:09,349: dangerous but I think that the ones who
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:19,429: chase us will find that we are more
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:24,410: dangerous well I guess maybe exactly so

01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:11,699: number of these figures loping toward
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,050: the party you would not believe how
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:16,289: difficult it is to scoot your chair
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:18,510: forward if you're covered in rats if I
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:22,069: didn't I'd that's it it's a new type of
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:25,680: challenge this is hard mode for sitting
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:27,559: if you ever wanted to know so but you
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:31,980: can see I mean there's there's got to be

01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:41,909: steadily pulling away and they are just
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:44,430: being lost in this rain okay and mist
01:11:41,909 --> 01:11:46,800: so we're outrunning them oh yes okay

01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:17,139: through this for this rain soaked path
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:20,439: trees whipping in the wind and it is

01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:18,059: purpose is clearly to seize and snare
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:22,779: carts as they travel through this wood

01:32:12,529 --> 01:32:18,229: challenge for this thing to sort of
01:32:14,659 --> 01:32:22,970: Scrabble and keep on that last hit like

01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:17,130: like there's some part of you that

01:34:24,729 --> 01:34:30,309: so you at a moment you exist in these
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:33,369: two coordinates extremely conflicted
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:42,340: right now and I go I go walnut Suns
01:34:33,369 --> 01:34:45,909: getting real low so you are able to you
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:48,489: were able to slow the cart corriander
01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:50,859: does not want to corriander just wants
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:52,029: to keep going until she reaches the end
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:55,409: of the fucking map
01:34:52,029 --> 01:34:59,800: okay you're able to pull the cart off
01:34:55,409 --> 01:35:02,050: into these into this torch lid area a
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,610: couple hundred feet off to the left so
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:06,310: you can sort of see these torches and
01:35:03,609 --> 01:35:09,599: lights twinkling in the back and there's
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:15,610: a couple torches near the road itself
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:18,880: that are lit with green flame and you're
01:35:15,609 --> 01:35:23,259: able to pull the cart straight down this
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:26,470: side path the church itself is lit
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:28,600: within by a combination of torches red
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:31,060: candles and glowing orbs of unknown
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:32,890: manufacturer light pours out of the
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:37,840: windows bringing to mind the lantern or
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:43,180: a lighthouse built in the wrong place so
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:47,369: as you enter you see no one inside right
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:51,310: now you see basically a simple chapel
01:35:47,369 --> 01:35:54,309: with a couple beds against the wall like
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:56,650: this is this is clearly a place of rest
01:35:54,310 --> 01:36:02,489: for travelers but it is they
01:35:56,649 --> 01:36:06,219: very it's almost like it's almost like
01:36:02,488 --> 01:36:08,500: battlefield decor like the way that it's
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:11,529: set up inside is almost like a it's like
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:13,689: a combination Chapel and barracks okay
01:36:11,529 --> 01:36:17,819: you can tell that at any moment these
01:36:13,689 --> 01:36:17,819: pews can be converted into small beds
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,420: but like I say there's right now that
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:26,199: any if there's someone named father
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:27,789: Gordon you cannot see him here every few
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:31,448: feet the walls to the left and right are
01:36:27,789 --> 01:36:33,609: adorned with stained glass depicting aid
01:36:31,448 --> 01:36:36,069: to Wanderers it is a place of such
01:36:33,609 --> 01:36:39,009: perfect comfort you can hardly let
01:36:36,069 --> 01:36:40,359: yourself believe it for a wilderness
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:43,420: chapel it is well-appointed
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:46,089: hill mites collect a tithe which some
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:48,489: call the dust of the road on goods that
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:50,140: travel through this wood the pews are
01:36:48,488 --> 01:36:53,500: stained dark and are polished the
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:56,199: fragrant wax a decorative shield stands
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:59,579: on a casual podium with three arrows of
01:36:56,198 --> 01:37:02,979: pure silver in a row on the front a
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:05,408: massive wall of stained glass stands
01:37:02,979 --> 01:37:08,129: behind the wooden podium depicting a
01:37:05,408 --> 01:37:11,189: brilliant sun shining over a golden cup
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:13,869: the howls outside rise to a sharp
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:17,049: crescendo rising in a blood-curdling
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:27,819: hunting song whose notes are clear and
01:37:17,050 --> 01:37:29,110: pure no work of mere beasts even even
01:37:27,819 --> 01:37:30,549: there even the Christmas specials the
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:36,429: Halloween special I got all these rats
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:39,429: you guys can read all right here we go
01:37:36,429 --> 01:37:43,869: so you can see that chorus voice for
01:37:39,429 --> 01:37:48,119: voice is diminished every few seconds
01:37:43,869 --> 01:37:50,529: that chorus seems to lose a howl ooh
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:54,840: these howls are slowly but surely
01:37:50,529 --> 01:37:59,069: turning into individual yelps of pain
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:59,069: that are receding into the distance
01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:04,960: these terrifying chords are held for
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,310: what seems to be an eternity and at the
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,859: moment you think the sound will drive
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:10,690: you mad at melts into stillness there's
01:38:08,859 --> 01:38:12,969: a long terrible moment of silence before
01:38:10,689 --> 01:38:15,428: the stained glass at the end of the
01:38:12,969 --> 01:38:17,948: chamber shatters inward it's majestic
01:38:15,429 --> 01:38:20,920: Sun replaced by the brilliant eye of the
01:38:17,948 --> 01:38:23,379: full moon unfolding itself from the
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:25,690: ground pieces of jagged glass are
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:29,170: dropping to the floor as its wounds mend
01:38:25,689 --> 01:38:32,469: themselves this is an ancient where bare
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:35,679: a grizzled old creature and his body is
01:38:32,469 --> 01:38:38,170: full of daggers swords and spirits that
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:42,100: the skin is closed around holding them
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:43,920: in place his ragged fur is gray and in
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:47,110: the light sparkles with a ghostly glow
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:49,300: his huge black eyes scour across the
01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:53,829: room and he finds the child with a
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:57,610: terrifying speed with a roar echoed by
01:38:53,829 --> 01:39:00,550: the wind outside he leaps so I need
01:38:57,609 --> 01:39:02,829: initiative from everybody I've had zero
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:04,840: chance to like catch our breath I know I

01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:40,738: werewolves are not small by any means
01:39:37,899 --> 01:39:47,158: but this is just like a side of beef
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:51,819: holding a gigantic battle ax in one hand
01:39:47,158 --> 01:39:56,978: mouth just a froth with hunger and it is
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:59,498: zeroed in directly on the bundle okay so

01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:27,680: it's like yes it does make him easier to
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:31,400: detect in battle but it is not improving
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:34,190: things like you between the moon outside
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:37,460: the window the house outside and now
01:45:34,189 --> 01:45:39,079: he's sort of further enunciated in his
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:41,750: size and gait
01:45:39,079 --> 01:45:43,609: yeah with this eldritch light like you
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:45,920: feel like that like a red fell shading
01:45:43,609 --> 01:45:48,589: around exactly like you do there is an
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:51,350: advantage in combat but everything else
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:53,210: about it is bad I see but I wanted have
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:54,740: it that going yeah that's cool yeah
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:57,710: that's better
01:45:54,739 --> 01:46:01,579: now we're getting somewhere yeah Genaro
01:45:57,710 --> 01:46:04,760: it's in all right I wanted some things
01:46:01,579 --> 01:46:08,359: Paladini and not Paladini who is the
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:10,460: farthest from the bear not me is
01:46:08,359 --> 01:46:13,189: everyone up in this bears grill no one
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:15,170: everyone said a child I would be keeping

01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:20,980: mouth all right so you're the farthest
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:22,670: away probably all right so I want to
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:23,959: disengage as well I want to get away
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:27,140: from the bear I don't be near the mayor

01:46:29,689 --> 01:46:33,169: that he's that big I mean think about it
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:34,399: think about it like this this is like a
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:36,069: small chapel
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:39,519: all right off the edge of the road I

01:46:44,359 --> 01:46:51,139: crazy
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:54,500: underhand to to the most responsible
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:57,050: person in the party with the paternal
01:46:54,500 --> 01:47:00,260: instincts that we get child care
01:46:57,050 --> 01:47:02,090: requires I got so many limbs to catch
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:03,530: that and he's got yeah this baby's gonna
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:06,619: land in a nest of tendrils and it's
01:47:03,529 --> 01:47:09,529: gonna be great athletics oh I'm swimming
01:47:06,619 --> 01:47:13,189: in them yeah exactly
01:47:09,529 --> 01:47:14,599: oh my god can't see is the one who
01:47:13,189 --> 01:47:18,039: should catch the baby that's so blind
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:18,039: that I can't catch a baby in the dark
01:47:18,939 --> 01:47:24,739: athletics
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:29,859: Oh baby

01:47:32,539 --> 01:47:39,260: a 25 let's see how the catch is oh I got
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:43,039: a I got a question do you I have so does
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:47,050: verifier apply in within this cube to
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:49,729: the baby whose decks I assume is low I
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:52,730: can have a new bandit on the baby
01:47:49,729 --> 01:47:55,789: alright that's not everything know is
01:47:52,729 --> 01:47:57,259: that I wouldn't have no cuz this is so
01:47:55,789 --> 01:47:59,869: weird like I don't have a problem with
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:01,670: this at all but you definitely don't
01:47:59,869 --> 01:48:03,699: want to have advantage on the baby and
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:07,010: won't give you a well I realize that
01:48:03,699 --> 01:48:11,149: thing to do let's read the card it's a
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:12,800: 20 foot cube yes in tacular special
01:48:11,149 --> 01:48:15,109: because what I've been able to catch the
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:17,779: baby in the light but not dinar cuz I
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:20,389: don't want listen Garrett again I am so
01:48:17,779 --> 01:48:22,159: so here for you figuring out some
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:24,230: awesome way to catch this baby my guy
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:26,180: yeah I'm ready to go to throw is amazing
01:48:24,229 --> 01:48:27,500: okay that's gonna help you but you got
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:29,659: to figure out a good way to do this yeah
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:31,159: it's located right in the hands know for
01:48:29,659 --> 01:48:32,389: the first thing to mind is that I don't
01:48:31,159 --> 01:48:34,279: personally want to catch the baby with
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:37,670: my hands Bugatti seems to have that
01:48:34,279 --> 01:48:41,509: under control so I can I love this
01:48:37,670 --> 01:48:45,020: uh none staff and and coil up to form a
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:46,360: much larger shape then it's got a little
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:50,330: bounce to it
01:48:46,359 --> 01:48:52,670: basket yeah yeah and that's what else
01:48:50,329 --> 01:48:54,769: exactly are you this but ligarius rolls
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:57,949: are mine so this is maybe this is bad
01:48:54,770 --> 01:49:01,120: for you okay see you got it I'll tell
01:48:57,949 --> 01:49:01,119: you if you catch them you can eat them
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:09,450: yeah brilliant plan it all went perfect
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:11,610: so the it's like coming like it's a
01:49:09,449 --> 01:49:14,010: surprise yeah this baby's coming for you
01:49:11,609 --> 01:49:16,319: well you're just like who like you just
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:19,610: you let go of legate sort of like huh in
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:28,769: midair well I didn't yell first sure
01:49:19,609 --> 01:49:30,839: impossible baby as the baby the baby is
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:33,240: is flying toward you you leave it up and
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:35,329: then you see Lagasse sort of soften and
01:49:33,239 --> 01:49:40,199: bend and this sees the baby then it goes
01:49:35,329 --> 01:49:42,869: and then wraps and coils almost like the
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:45,359: path of an electron oh yes just wraps
01:49:42,869 --> 01:49:47,729: and coils all around and then the baby
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:51,210: is caught in it and then it just sails
01:49:47,729 --> 01:49:53,489: through the air and it goes and bounces
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:57,300: against the back corner nice far away
01:49:53,489 --> 01:50:00,869: okay now I can back up spinner you don't
01:49:57,300 --> 01:50:02,789: care about me right no okay he's not
01:50:00,869 --> 01:50:04,289: interested in you I want to get as far
01:50:02,789 --> 01:50:06,539: away from the baby as possible with the
01:50:04,289 --> 01:50:08,460: bear between us and then when I'm far
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:11,640: enough away I want to compel dual to the
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:14,779: bear so he's gonna be like yo yogi I got
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:14,780: your picnic basket right here
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:23,150: I just thought of that I did not like it
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:25,130: that you've seen this adventure before
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:26,719: that was just off the dome that was off
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:31,520: the dome all right it's been everyone
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:33,199: its turn singing of a funny line all
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:35,960: right so you have tossed a baby I've
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:38,238: tossed a baby and I've run away and then
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:40,430: I've talked about shit I think we know
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:43,750: you have a plan but to anybody else it
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:45,950: would look like the coward a child down
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:50,060: third act of my turn
01:50:45,949 --> 01:50:51,889: it all comes the light exactly so he
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:53,360: needs a wisdom saving throw on a failed
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:55,250: save he's drawn to me compelled by
01:50:53,359 --> 01:50:57,409: divine demand further me duration
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:59,329: disadvantage on attack roles against
01:50:57,409 --> 01:51:00,889: anyone other than me and he's got to
01:50:59,329 --> 01:51:02,029: keep making wisdom throws any time he
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:06,530: wants to get away from me what's the
01:51:02,029 --> 01:51:08,179: safe wisdom save me throw against my you
01:51:06,529 --> 01:51:11,779: you may be surprised to learn that we're
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:14,450: bears 14 like wisdoms not like yeah yeah

01:51:14,449 --> 01:51:18,769: here it's down here the water is MCATs
01:51:18,229 --> 01:51:21,289: grass
01:51:18,770 --> 01:51:26,840: yeah exactly what's his myers-briggs
01:51:21,289 --> 01:51:28,880: yeah let's see he is compelled to deal
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:31,069: with you if anyone touches him he will
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,500: not be okay this is me the bear you guys

01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:46,520: hunger that is not about flesh in his
01:51:41,238 --> 01:51:50,029: eyes toward this child it is only just
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:52,310: the thinnest thread of magic so he's
01:51:50,029 --> 01:51:54,829: like looking over in the corner and then
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:57,350: like the magic is like yanking him back
01:51:54,829 --> 01:51:59,329: into combat with you and then he just
01:51:57,350 --> 01:52:02,060: looks over and sees it like takes a
01:51:59,329 --> 01:52:05,269: sidestep and then pulls back so he's
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:07,910: sort of like he is at war with himself
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:10,640: about this and you you think that you
