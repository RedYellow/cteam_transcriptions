Time is the enemy
the past, it threatens
the fastest weapon
You wouldn't make it past a second
and that's the question

Play it brash and reckless
or choose a cautious solution you thought was prudent

In any sepulchre pulchritude'll become the putrid
It's that wealth that I'm pursuing
No mountain too steep, no dungeon too deep
To send expendable marks to the top of the peak or beneath

They see you, they comes like sharks to it
While I swim in that money bin like Carl Barks drew it
..... national parks druid
I'll send him home in a natural box with a closed top and most of the parts included
