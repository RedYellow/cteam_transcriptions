Time is the enemy
the past, it threatens
the fastest weapon
You wouldn't make it past a second
and that's the question
play it brash and reckless
or choose a cautious solution 
you thought was prudent

In any sepulchre
pulchritude'll become the putrid
It's that wealth that I'm pursuing
No mountain too steep, no dungeon too deep
To send expendable marks
up to the top of the peak or beneath

They see you bleed, they comes like sharks to it
While I swim in that money bin like Carl Barks drew it
So send your national parks druid
I'll send them home in a natural box
with a closed top
and most of the parts included

Save your breath for a cleric confessor
Death is a lesson and life is a tenured professor
But if you're seeking my official advice,
sign on the dotted line, initial it twice
