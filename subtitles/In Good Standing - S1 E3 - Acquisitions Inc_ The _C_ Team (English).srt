1
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,140
JERRY: No. Be cool. You have to be legit. This is a very serious thing...

2
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,939
Hello. I'm Jerriford K. Horkims.

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,340
Dungeon Master of the "C" Team.

4
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,020
To my right...

5
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,820
JERRY: is Ryan Hartman, as Donaar Blit'zen. RYAN: (clapping)

6
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,560
JERRY: Master of puns. We've got Amy the Falcon.

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,900
KRIS: (clapping louder and faster) AMY: That's me.

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,920
AMY: Oh! Yes. Thank you! KATE: Oh! Falcon. Very good.

9
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,500
JERRY: Going with the Walnut Dankgr-- Are you still going with the druid? Is that still your character?

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,180
AMY: I mean... Let's do it one more week, and see how it goes.

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,640
JERRY: We'll see if takes off the way.

12
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:21,700
Kate Welch. Always a pleasure. Not your grandma's grandma.

13
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,460
KATE: Not at all.

14
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,239
JERRY: Rosie Beestinger.

15
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,159
K'thriss Drow'b.

16
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,000
You've finally managed to put your OC deep enough

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,140
JERRY: into the Acquisitions Incorporated lore. KRIS: I self-inserted myself.

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,260
JERRY: You self-inserted yourself. Kris-ception! KATE: Deep into the hilt. &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm there.

19
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,660
KRIS/JERRY: (Inception sound effect)

20
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,920
JERRY: Now we are jumping right into the "C" Team, Episode 3: In Good Standing.

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,180
KATE: (noncommittal sound) RYAN: Hey. I like that.

22
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,340
KRIS: Is that the title? KATE: Oh is that the title?

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,859
KATE: Oh! We've got a title! In Good Standing.

24
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:55,659
JERRY: We'll see if we get all-- Yeah write that shit down. AMY: Oh it's notes per episode?

25
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,420
KATE: I do! KRIS: It's going to be a poem.

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,579
AMY: Committed to memory. JERRY: It's going to be good.

27
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,519
KATE: I'm going to sell this on eBay later. JERRY: No, no. It's going to be an acrostic.

28
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,000
JERRY: Like, by the times it's like-- (gasp)

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,280
It was there all along!

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,060
AMY: It spells, "Omin is great." (noncommittal sound)

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,780
JERRY: As soon as it gets to "Omin is gr..." you're like-- KATE: I get it.

32
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,360
KRIS: I don't need to do the rest.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,420
KATE: I'd like to solve the puzzle.

34
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:12,839
JERRY: But here's how it's going.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,199
AMY: Not good.

36
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,479
JERRY: At our last-- When last we saw our heroes...

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,039
you had escaped from a bizarre prison.

38
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:24,599
RYAN: Yup. JERRY: That people were perfectly happy to live in.

39
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,819
Because stew was constantly reappearing on plates.

40
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,000
Beds were being made by ghosts apparently.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,360
It had the nice, you know, turndown service.

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,780
And that was sufficient for them.

43
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,460
But you guys decided that you did not want to hangout there for an extended period of time.

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,099
And I went with it.

45
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,419
I mean, the campaign was suppose to end there.

46
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,659
RYAN: I was going to say, we should have just ended this thing right there!

47
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,020
We live there forever. The end.

48
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,980
JERRY: No. The credits would go-- Obviously there would be a saxophone...

49
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:57,340
You know what I mean? There would be scenes from happy events later.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,140
All in the same place.

51
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,839
What eventually happened,

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,560
was that you had freed someone they had bound.

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,680
They left.

54
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,259
You took a hostage.

55
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,539
So, let's start the campaign off right,

56
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,939
with hostage taking as a policy.

57
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,140
The rogue was with you and you led the rogue out of that chamber, out of that final part of the Test Market.

58
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,119
AMY: Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:27,139
JERRY: But when you emerged through the portal you saw a...

60
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,520
fresh country road, breeze,

61
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,900
trees that sort of formed themselves into an arch.

62
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,900
In the distance a portal is visible.

63
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,599
But your friend K'thriss Drow'b...

64
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,659
KRIS: Friend.

65
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,060
JERRY: "Friend." &gt;&gt; RYAN: Again... AMY: Again... very loose.

66
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,000
RYAN: We just met. KRIS: De facto.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,340
KATE: Have not actually learned his name yet. JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,860
RYAN: We spent three nights together.

69
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,919
JERRY: Listen-- KRIS: He keeps to himself.

70
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,539
RYAN: Amongst-- You're as-- I'm as friendly with you as I am with those mice.

71
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,739
(laughter)

72
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,900
RYAN: You're on the same tier. KRIS: I rode them. So...

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,340
KATE: Aww I miss them. JERRY: Same tier.

74
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,319
AMY: Extremely. KRIS: Don't get comf y.

75
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,000
JERRY: On the social scale... RYAN: Yeah.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,020
JERRY: One K'thriss Drow'b. Three mice.

77
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,180
JERRY: About the same. RYAN: Yeah.

78
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,439
RYAN: That's the exchange rate.

79
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,300
JERRY: Yeah exactly.

80
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:15,859
But K'thriss Drow'b, you do not see an idyllic forest scene.

81
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:23,780
If there is something that could be the polar opposite of an idyllic forest scene, that is what you see.

82
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,199
So...

83
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,599
clutching your focus,

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,240
this chunk of stolen onyx or obsidian,

85
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,839
with a symbol on it that you can't perceive.

86
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,939
KRIS: Right. JERRY: You are floating against a starfield.

87
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,339
And it is either so cold that it feels hot, or so hot that it feels cold.

88
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:55,859
The sensations coming in are difficult to unravel, functionally speaking.

89
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:03,120
And in the great distance you can see a red pinprick.

90
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:11,979
One of the pinpricks in this field of lights is growing in your vision and approaching you.

91
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,800
And you have a dim awareness that there are other people here with you in this space.

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,220
But essentially you're just clutching this stone in a sort of fetal position hurtling through this--

93
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,360
JERRY: expanse. KRIS: But I feel motion. I am flying.

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,300
JERRY: Yeah you are hurtling-- traversing, but it's so difficult to tell the rate of it.

95
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:40,340
Because there's nothing around you except for this dim awareness of these two other figures.

96
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,139
KRIS: (whispering) Two other figures.

97
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,939
KRIS: Um... KATE: Sounds tight. I got to say.

98
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,360
KATE: Had me at "starfield."

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,439
JERRY: (laughs) Yeah it's like, shit yeah--

100
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,420
RYAN: You had me at "pinprick."

101
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,520
JERRY: (laughs) Why can't I--

102
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,479
KRIS: It's just a screensaver.

103
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,319
(laughter) KRIS: I would--

104
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,219
RYAN: Now these pipes start forming in front of you.

105
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,660
JERRY: Yeah it's like, how do you interact with these pipes?

106
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,740
JERRY: There's some fucking-- KRIS: Where do they go?

107
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,000
JERRY: They're going wild.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,339
KRIS: Let me see...

109
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,959
I guess the first thing I do is... well I attempt to speak.

110
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,159
Just to like clear my throat. See if I can make sound in this place.

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: Am I able to?

112
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,339
JERRY: Yeah you are. What do you say?

113
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,500
KRIS: I just, where am I?

114
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,019
JERRY: You say these words out. You can hear them.

115
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,599
There's some medium capable of communicating it.

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,660
To your left you can see...

117
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,240
the person whose life you have made progressively worse.

118
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Every moment.

119
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,180
This is the person whose bonds you clipped... upstairs.

120
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,480
KRIS: He's come along?

121
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,700
JERRY: He is somehow along for the ride.

122
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,180
In this alternate place.

123
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,819
To your other side-- imagine a...

124
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,420
JERRY: Imagine-- KRIS: Let me change my first words there.

125
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,480
KRIS: Hey, buddy!

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,680
(laughter)

127
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,840
RYAN: It's the naked guy.

128
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,519
JERRY: Imagine a situation, you know, in another universe, there would be three men on crosses.

129
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,839
KRIS: Right. JERRY: It's that tier of destiny.

130
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,659
KRIS: Okay. JERRY: Hurtling toward this increasing sphere of red.

131
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:24,239
JERRY: To your right, the rogue that you marshalled through the portal is here with you as well.

132
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,060
KATE: Seems like a pretty well-balanced party.

133
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,319
JERRY: Yeah you guys-- &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah I'm good to go. RYAN: Is this your new team?

134
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,439
JERRY: Yeah exactly we're going to-- AMY: I hope you're really happy together.

135
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,399
RYAN/KRIS: Yeah.

136
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,379
JERRY: We're going to do this-- KRIS: Spin-off.

137
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,759
JERRY: We're going to do this spin-off already.

138
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,639
RYAN: The "D" Team?

139
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,740
KATE: It's the Frasier to our Cheers.

140
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,500
JERRY: Exactly yeah. We have "D" through "Z."

141
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,600
You know? Obviously there's growth opportunities.

142
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,360
KRIS: Yeah there's plenty.

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,259
So I got... so the one on my left is the one I freed from my bonds.

144
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:52,439
The one on my right is that rogue who wanted to live in that false inn forever.

145
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,800
JERRY: Yeah had made a kind of peace with this alternate existence.

146
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,079
KRIS: So what do they look like right now?

147
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,519
JERRY: They are suspended in absolute terror.

148
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,659
And as I said you get...

149
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,859
You can sense that you are moving--

150
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,420
This is really a calculation you're making on your part.

151
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,020
Because the three of you seem to be in the same configuration.

152
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,099
As though you're being drawn into this...

153
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,300
KRIS: This red circle. JERRY: this increasing-- this sort of ruby orb.

154
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,279
KRIS: (whispering) Jeez!

155
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,980
I cast Dancing Lights-- No. That's worthless.

156
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,439
JERRY: Cast it if you want. KRIS: Nah. I'm good.

157
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,879
RYAN: Just let it envelope you?

158
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,220
KRIS: Yeah I don't-- AMY: Just give me the sweet release of death I've been looking for.

159
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,680
KRIS: Yeah at what point are we going in?

160
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,019
KATE: It does sound exciting.

161
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,579
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: For you. &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah for you.

162
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,400
KRIS: Well I am clutching my hunk of altar.

163
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,039
Because I feel like this was meant for me to see.

164
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,459
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: This feels special.

165
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,100
JERRY: There may be... KRIS: I don't know why these guys are here.

166
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,200
JERRY: There may be a case.

167
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,740
There may be a case for it.

168
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,720
It continues to grow.

169
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,320
And then as the-- the closer it gets you can see that...

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,400
it seems round at a distance, but it doesn't have...

171
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,240
it doesn't have a true shape.

172
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,539
It just has a volume.

173
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:29,400
And like a gem, you can see that light penetrates it and refracts against impossible structures.

174
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,259
KRIS: So it has like a size but no aspect.

175
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,460
JERRY: That's right. KRIS: It doesn't have a shape.

176
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,560
JERRY: That's right. RYAN: It's a fractal.

177
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:41,219
JERRY: And light can-- light hits it and then travels via some path inside of it.

178
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:48,079
And the closer it gets you can see what look like--

179
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,399
Imagine like the-- like a frond of an aloe vera plant?

180
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,120
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: So it's long, triangular...

181
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,539
KRIS: Fractal, like you said. JERRY: Exactly.

182
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,259
JERRY: Along the edge...

183
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,039
Along the edge, teeth...

184
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,720
that dance and sway along sort of the inner edge.

185
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,040
KRIS: Clearly teeth, though.

186
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,000
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: Not like, oh so white structures. It's like--

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,799
JERRY: You don't-- They read-- They parse to you as an organism of, you know, with an interest in survival.

188
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,319
KRIS: Hmm. JERRY: This parses to you as a teeth.

189
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,200
JERRY: It has a teeth-type deal going around it.

190
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,580
And as I said they sort of dance and sway

191
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,940
JERRY: in whatever alien gum this exists. RYAN: Dancing teeth?

192
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,440
JERRY: Dancing Teeth, obviously check out my first album.

193
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,740
AMY: (laughs) JERRY: Jerry Holkins. DJ Jerry Holkins.

194
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:40,819
Dancing Teeth.

195
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,660
KRIS: It's dope.

196
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:49,500
JERRY: No. So it reaches out almost with a curiosity toward the rogue.

197
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:55,599
The rogue immediately begins to dispense weaponry.

198
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,100
Daggers coming from...

199
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,460
from-- absolutely from mysterious locales in her kit.

200
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:08,120
And they hit it and it sort of sounds like...

201
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,019
like if a fork were to be slid off of a table,

202
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,480
and were to strike a wood floor.

203
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,620
It just rings in a metallic way.

204
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,259
JERRY: But you're not-- KRIS: No purchase.

205
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,580
JERRY: You're not sure that...

206
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,159
You're not sure that these daggers are going to impact.

207
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,500
You think that daggers might not be the right tool in this case.

208
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,000
Farther out the frond...

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
With interest now!

210
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,740
Maybe even enthusiasm.

211
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,720
Goes around, and then in the manner of a Venus flytrap...

212
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,000
just cinches-- just closes.

213
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,079
KRIS: On the other guy.

214
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,460
JERRY: Yeah, and then it starts to draw them in back toward the center mass of this orb.

215
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:03,720
And as you see it get closer to the center it begins to thrash them against itself...

216
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,299
KRIS: It's like the inside of a Langolier.

217
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,139
JERRY: Yeah! And then... RYAN: (laughs)

218
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:15,860
JERRY: they get drawn in to that sort of dark mass that you can see light refracting off inside.

219
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,740
KRIS: No, so they don't exist anymore.

220
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,059
I'm not seeing them going, hooray!

221
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:23,139
JERRY: No. KATE: I don't think they ever did exist after this.

222
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,779
JERRY: You think-- AMY: Yeah they've been eaten out of time.

223
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,620
JERRY: You think-- KATE: (laughing) Nice.

224
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,620
JERRY: You think that there is a case to be made

225
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,639
that they will not be showing up at the company Christmas party.

226
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,919
KRIS: Okay. Interesting.

227
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,539
KRIS: All right do I-- KATE: It sounds metal as hell, to be honest with you.

228
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,700
KRIS: I-- I um...

229
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,320
I hold my...

230
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,419
focus out with the sigil side toward it.

231
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,100
As much as I can.

232
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,899
How far am I from it? I assume it knows me--

233
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:02,699
JERRY: It is continuing now until it fills almost your entire field of vision.

234
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:11,299
And you can see that it has extended a kind of pseudopod beneath...

235
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:16,039
and it has risen up beneath you, almost like two hands.

236
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,620
And you're now standing on a platform of this living ruby.

237
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,000
KRIS: (exhales) AMY: It likes you.

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,919
KRIS: Kind of just going to start weeping.

239
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,159
But I hold it together.

240
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,759
(stammering) I say...

241
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:36,059
I reach out this time telepathically with Awakened Mind.

242
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,679
And I say, is it you?

243
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,100
KATE: (whispering) What?

244
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,159
(exhales) (whispering) Dungeons &amp; Dragons, bitch!

245
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,039
(laughter) JERRY: I love this man.

246
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:55,720
KRIS: Because I'm assuming that this rune that I cannot read, even though I can read all language, is a name.

247
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,200
Is a name that perhaps this thing owns.

248
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,359
KRIS: Is he? JERRY: Is conscious of.

249
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,720
KRIS: Yes. It must at least be.

250
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,539
JERRY: "Why have you deny my precious gifts?"

251
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,200
KATE: (whispering) I have chills! AMY: This is very good!

252
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,440
JERRY: You were so close.

253
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,100
"Why did you deny my gifts?"

254
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,500
KRIS: (whispering) Gifts...

255
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,299
JERRY: "You were so near to it. So near to me."

256
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,199
"If I told you my name now, you would be destroyed."

257
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,100
KRIS: Got to think this through-- JERRY: "We could have cracked this world like an egg."

258
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,800
KRIS: You're saying everything I want to hear.

259
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,240
(laughter)

260
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,100
Even though I'm a little upset that I didn't disappointed.

261
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,359
JERRY: "Do you even recall my Trifold Revelation?"

262
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,600
KRIS: I do not. It was taken from me.

263
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,159
JERRY: You hear a shriek.

264
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:01,139
Somewhere in it. It's not the voice that you hear.

265
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,759
Because the voice that you hear is reverberating inside your skull.

266
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,360
This sound comes from the entity.

267
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,240
Says...

268
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,800
"The universe..."

269
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:16,600
"is nothing..."

270
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,460
"but meat..."

271
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:20,019
"and mouths."

272
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,699
"And you are one of my mouths."

273
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,620
"This is the pact you entered into."

274
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,379
"You have no recollection of it?

275
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,059
"You understand that that has no effect on whether you are bound by it."

276
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,000
KRIS: Absolutely.

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,259
I say I agree with it a hundred percent.

278
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,500
It may not even be language I'm using.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,519
I hope that it can sense my enthusiasm for this philosophy.

280
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,759
JERRY: The entire structure...

281
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,440
The entire ruby structure in front of you becomes transparent.

282
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,500
And you can see all the pinpricks through it and around it.

283
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,720
You're surrounded by it.

284
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,259
And it says,

285
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
"We will devour..."

286
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:05,860
"every world..."

287
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,359
"and every star."

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,679
KRIS: There-- JERRY: "This is my Second Revelation."

289
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,079
KRIS: There's no other way it could have been.

290
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,799
JERRY: "I will fatten you..."

291
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,839
"with destruction..."

292
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,720
"until you, yourself, are devoured."

293
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,680
KRIS: I'm at your service.

294
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,560
KATE: (panting breaths)

295
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,479
RYAN: He seems nice.

296
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,720
JERRY: "But you know--" AMY: What a good guy!

297
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,000
RYAN: Yeah. (laughs)

298
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,580
JERRY: "You know that my gifts are not free."

299
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,759
"This is the pact you entered into willingly."

300
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,980
"When you forsook Lolth."

301
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:51,359
"A pitiful creatures. A..."

302
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,559
"local..."

303
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,320
"goddess."

304
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,560
KRIS: She sucks.

305
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,839
(laughter) RYAN: A townie.

306
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,340
(laughter) JERRY: Exactly.

307
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,399
KRIS: Low rent. RYAN: Yeah.

308
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,259
KATE: (laughs) (whispering) Jeez. JERRY: But there are...

309
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,060
"This is my fear."

310
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:12,480
And the blood-red reverts in front of you.

311
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,559
Says, "There are..."

312
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,180
"there are aspects of myself..."

313
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,839
"that can't forgive you..."

314
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,880
"for having cast away..."

315
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,019
"our precious gifts."

316
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,540
"If you are able to survive them..."

317
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,399
"we may continue."

318
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:41,319
And you can see rippling out from the right edge... just like mouths.

319
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:47,019
It's like those awful online pictures where like it shows a person's knee...

320
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,939
JERRY: And it's all-- AMY: Hmm!

321
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,720
JERRY: And it's all-- KRIS: It's like a lotus pod, yeah.

322
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,960
JERRY: Lotus pod. KATE: Ew!

323
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:00,579
JERRY: You see it just dips in and then there's just like barnacled mouths sweeping around.

324
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,439
And it rushes over you.

325
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,160
And completely covers you.

326
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,399
KRIS: I-- as it does I make the sound,

327
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,120
Aha!

328
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,459
(laughter)

329
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,200
(laughter) RYAN: You let out a little, yippee!

330
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,080
(laughter)

331
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,439
JERRY: But as it does so...

332
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,099
you feel the contact of it.

333
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,000
Impossibly hot.

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,119
KRIS: Hmm.

335
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,159
JERRY: But like...

336
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,019
Even another second of it would be too much.

337
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,960
And then beginning with your hand and the stone...

338
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,019
it peels and pulls away.

339
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:43,240
So there's something about it. It's almost like a floatie.

340
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,440
You're in a kind of womb of this stuff.

341
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,880
And it is progressively, continually, trying to counteract this stone.

342
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,760
KRIS: This object I have. I see.

343
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,819
KRIS: (sighs) JERRY: So...

344
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,139
JERRY: that's what's happening with you.

345
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,799
KRIS: (clapping) JERRY: On this path...

346
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,539
AMY: Literally a walk in the woods compared to you. JERRY: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

347
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:07,059
RYAN: It's been three hours or-- (whistles)

348
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,599
We've long given up on you.

349
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,620
AMY: So more equity, right? JERRY: Exactly.

350
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,459
KATE: Yep. 33.3% share. JERRY: 33/33/33.

351
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,880
JERRY: I'll just that last percent.

352
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,500
JERRY: It'll accrue to the Dungeon Master. AMY: (noncommittal sound)

353
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:25,700
JERRY: So the way that it functions for the rest of the party is that...

354
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,500
you can hear a conversation occurring.

355
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,819
AMY: (laughing) Oh god! JERRY: You can't make out the words.

356
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:33,619
AMY: Okay.

357
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,299
JERRY: But there is a small voice echoed by a vast voice.

358
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,960
AMY: (high pitched) Me, me, me, me, me. RYAN: Little baby voice.

359
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,460
KATE: (low pitched murmuring sound)

360
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,039
AMY: (high pitched) Me, me.

361
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,680
(laughter) KRIS: Cool and powerful.

362
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,960
(laughter)

363
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,440
JERRY: And after-- RYAN: And confident!

364
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,299
JERRY: After a couple of exchanges bounce back and forth...

365
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,200
every time the larger sound is enunciated...

366
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:01,779
you can see cracks...

367
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,060
from behind you...

368
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,519
faults...

369
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,879
AMY: Oh okay.

370
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,340
JERRY: reaching out.

371
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,019
The problem is that these faults are not nearly in the ground itself.

372
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,299
It isn't a natural phenomenon.

373
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,060
These cracks extend directly through space.

374
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,500
AMY: The good kind of cracks! JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,039
JERRY: Yes it's not-- AMY: (chef's kiss sound)

376
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,940
JERRY: It's a crack epidemic.

377
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,820
AMY: Sure. RYAN: Mmm.

378
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,980
JERRY: And it reaches out-- RYAN: Plaguing our forest. (laughs)

379
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,700
JERRY: Yeah exactly. (laughter)

380
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,340
JERRY: Until there are no fewer than six.

381
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:40,099
And then there is a shift at some final moment,

382
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
where in a seismic way...

383
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,620
they push and then separate.

384
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,799
AMY: Great.

385
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:50,859
JERRY: So on one shard to the left,

386
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,160
it has split out and Rosie is here on a kind of spire that reaches up and out.

387
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:05,599
Walnut and Donaar are on a larger flat section to the right reaching out.

388
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,059
But the doorway path that was available to you...

389
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,660
is now sundered in slices.

390
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,520
AMY: Great.

391
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,399
JERRY: And you can see--

392
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,080
This is incredibly odd, but I have to describe it to you.

393
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,199
JERRY: That's the task I've been given. AMY: Sure. Bring it on.

394
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:32,839
JERRY: In the cracks themselves, you can see what looks almost like a...

395
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,000
It's crystalline in how it refracts light.

396
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,779
And it's polygonal. It has faces like a gem.

397
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,339
But it flows underneath like a liquid.

398
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,180
And you can see...

399
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,879
Again! This is strange.

400
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,159
Both to your left...

401
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,119
and to your right you see exactly the same thing.

402
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,080
As though it's the same space in different sides.

403
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,059
AMY: Did someone like throw rock in the holodeck?

404
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,359
RYAN: Uh... &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah. JERRY: Right?

405
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,879
AMY: Okay. JERRY: And so you can see...

406
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,059
and you see K'thriss Drow'b...

407
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,940
clinging on to what you know to be his focus.

408
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,679
Sort of bobbing like a bottle in this stuff.

409
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,799
Like you can see that it is trying to wash up and pull him down.

410
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:22,099
But by the same token, there is something-- some property...

411
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,519
of this situation that is keeping him from being completely consumed.

412
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,700
AMY: And that's what we get? JERRY: That's what you get.

413
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,000
RYAN: Well we're on a platform.

414
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,160
KATE: How far is my spire from their platform? RYAN: So we can just 50/50 this.

415
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,740
JERRY: Right now the crack-- (laughter)

416
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,660
JERRY: the crack between the two is about five feet.

417
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,540
KATE: Okay.

418
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,980
AMY: That's a lot. JERRY: Like I say, each of these splits--

419
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
JERRY: So even in the cracks that you can see...

420
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,619
that are higher-- that are just in space--

421
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,039
you can see the same reflection.

422
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,799
You can see K'thriss Drow'b in those as well reaching out.

423
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,019
KRIS: Do I have an awareness of them?

424
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,379
JERRY: You do not.

425
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,240
You are completely consumed by this act of consumption.

426
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,840
And knowing K'thriss,

427
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,680
being familiar with that character sheet,

428
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,080
I'll be very curious to see how you spend this time...

429
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:20,460
in this kind of proximity...

430
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,039
to this entity that you have sought so long.

431
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,920
RYAN: The final moments. KRIS: (ecstatic grunts)

432
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,400
JERRY: Right? I mean I'll be curious how you invest that time. But--

433
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,100
KRIS: That's not even for the DM to know.

434
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:32,659
JERRY: No, exactly. (laughter)

435
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,980
JERRY: Exactly. But I would like to get-- just because I'm going to need it eventually,

436
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,039
I would like to get initiative rolls from the people.

437
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,720
KRIS: Ooh yeah. AMY: Great. I love when it's--

438
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,860
AMY: Hey solve the puzzle. But also just initiative anyway. KATE: Just in case.

439
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,220
RYAN: Fight this giant red d20.

440
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,180
AMY: Walnut got 18.

441
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,240
JERRY: 18's very good.

442
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,099
RYAN: Uh... 16. JERRY: Mm-hmm.

443
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,100
KATE: Eight!

444
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,119
AMY: That's almost as good as an 18. RYAN: It is.

445
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,039
KATE: Hey! This is a cooperative game, ladies and gentlemen.

446
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,779
JERRY: Yeah. I need one from you too, K'thriss Drow'b. KRIS: Oh yeah. Let's get that.

447
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,039
You going to love the way you look. I guarantee it.

448
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:06,819
It's a seven.

449
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,679
(laughter) JERRY: All right.

450
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,500
JERRY: Oh hey. And look at my cool initiative thingies. KATE: (gasps) Ooh!

451
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,599
JERRY: That Elyssa made for me. So cool!

452
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,379
KATE: Thanks, Elyssa! KRIS: Hooray!

453
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,260
AMY: That's good for me too. KATE: That's so cute.

454
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,299
JERRY: And hey! Thanks for drawing all the characters.

455
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,339
JERRY: That was very nice of you. KATE: Thanks, Kris.

456
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,199
KRIS: A pleasure!

457
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,819
JERRY: Now Walnut!

458
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:32,220
How are you going to contend with either this fractured door, this K'thriss Drow'b scenario, or both?

459
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,139
AMY: So... um...

460
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,259
knowing what I know of the drow and knowing nothing of what you're seeing,

461
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:45,859
I immediately think that he is responsible for what's happening.

462
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,939
JERRY: (laughs)

463
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,140
AMY: Like I see this focus as like-- things are you know...

464
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,660
JERRY: Shit is coming out of it. AMY: Yeah like things are coming out of it.

465
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,680
AMY: This is shaking that you've-- you know, we fallen into some dark trap of yours.

466
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,060
KRIS: Well wait. Let me get some clarity here.

467
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,819
Am I warding these mouths away with my focus?

468
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:07,539
AMY: Or are you just watching it? KRIS: Is it clear? Or am I just observing it?

469
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,359
JERRY: When your turn comes around, you can play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

470
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,939
KRIS: But... I want to reroll initiative. JERRY: Until then play with your phone!

471
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,259
KRIS: No. RYAN: Yeah. (laughs)

472
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,180
RYAN: I want to keep rolling until I win. AMY: Me first!

473
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,820
(laughter) JERRY: Until I succeed.

474
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,839
AMY: Okay one last question. JERRY: Yeah.

475
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,580
AMY: Well maybe not like it's directly-- but I definitely think maybe this is some of your dark drow workings.

476
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,480
JERRY: Mm-hmm.

477
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,860
AMY: Do I perceive this as I'm actually seeing K'thriss?

478
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:38,299
Or am I looking at this as if through a projected image?

479
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,879
Am I actually seeing him twice?

480
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,279
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I mean the way that the closest thing that you can think of--

481
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,599
like the closest analogy would be a broken mirror.

482
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,459
AMY: Okay. Okay.

483
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,579
JERRY: Because the movements are identical.

484
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,000
AMY: Completely identical. Okay, okay, okay.

485
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,220
Oh goodness gracious.

486
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,360
I have just...

487
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,159
RYAN: Turn into a bear. (laughs)

488
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,860
(laughter)

489
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:04,819
AMY: Ah! Um...

490
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:06,819
I just have nothing that I...

491
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,640
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: I was going to say, try Thornwhip again.

492
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,000
RYAN: (laughs) Just whipping his face? KATE: Oh!

493
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,640
KRIS: Ah! AMY: Stop it!

494
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,860
AMY: Stop it! Stop it!

495
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:15,740
JERRY: Stop doing evil. AMY: Stop with that devil stuff!

496
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,279
AMY: No, oh. Good golly what do I even have for this?

497
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,559
I'm so used to playing a spellcaster where I'm like,

498
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,559
Ah. I conjure up a disc and I can get us out of here.

499
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,619
JERRY: Yeah you can conjure discs, you can use physical solutions. I mean there's all kinds of--

500
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:34,659
AMY: How far away is Rosie about?

501
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,300
JERRY: Right now the fissure between the two of you is five.

502
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,339
About five feet.

503
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,599
JERRY: It's pretty easily jumpable. AMY: That's nimble.

504
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,319
AMY: Good gracious.

505
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:52,759
I don't even know what to try...

506
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:55,900
JERRY: It isn't a true initiative situation.

507
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,460
So if you just want to think about the situation for a while that's totally legitimate.

508
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,480
I know that I have presented you with something... you know...

509
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,180
AMY: Yeah this is like so... JERRY: novel.

510
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,539
AMY: Like I'm in this crystalline Cthuluoid-dimension here.

511
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,180
AMY: But it's just a forest fractaling apart. KATE: Right but it's fucking tight as hell, isn't it?

512
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,039
AMY: It's tight &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah, so good. RYAN: It's the third episode.

513
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,619
AMY: Yeah it's the third episode just with endgame stuff. RYAN: Doesn't it usually scale up to this?

514
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:17,439
JERRY: No, no. You don't even know where the endgame goes.

515
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:20,759
KATE: You stay put, because Rosie's by herself.

516
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,180
So I will jump to meet you guys when it is my turn to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

517
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,200
AMY: Sure, sure, sure.

518
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,220
Yeah so just the image of a beautiful forest fractaling apart, let's just pretend that Walnut is...

519
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
JERRY: Just stunned. AMY: (shakily) Wha-ah-ah.

520
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,120
KATE: Okay. JERRY: Stunned by it.

521
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,519
JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen.

522
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,079
Approach this scenario and generate solutions.

523
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,179
RYAN: (sighs) God... JERRY: Create a plan for Q1.

524
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,519
RYAN: Yeah so I guess in this sort of scenario I would be like,

525
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:46,859
Hey, vagrant!

526
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,480
Can you hear me?

527
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,580
KRIS: Are you talking to me? RYAN: Yeah.

528
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,000
RYAN: Can he hear me? KRIS: What do I hear?

529
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,500
JERRY: It sounds like you're underwater.

530
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,660
RYAN: Oh. KRIS: So I can hear a voice.

531
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,400
KRIS: Can I tell it's him? JERRY: Yeah you can tell.

532
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,200
KRIS: Oh okay, okay.

533
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,680
RYAN: Just can't see me. JERRY: He has a novel cadence.

534
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,360
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: I'll say.

535
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,139
KRIS: Ah! Suddenly I'm in the void.

536
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,160
RYAN: Dulcet tones.

537
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,940
JERRY: The first words you exchanged followed a similar pattern.

538
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,720
JERRY: So... KRIS: Okay.

539
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,380
KRIS: (laughs) RYAN: I don't have any more money!

540
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,880
(laughter)

541
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,240
AMY: Money... money... money...

542
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,120
KRIS: This isn't necessary! I don't have any...

543
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:28,099
KRIS: (stammering) Why are you here?

544
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:30,959
I'm offended that he's present for this.

545
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,160
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had a cool thing going. KRIS: Yeah.

546
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,340
JERRY: I had this evil god. AMY: It's like your mom walking in on you.

547
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,699
JERRY: Yeah that's what it is.

548
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,920
JERRY: Mom! KRIS: I wasn't doing anything.

549
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,759
AMY: (shuddering)

550
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,180
JERRY: It's just my evil lord. KATE: That's why I want a lock on the door.

551
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,420
JERRY: Yeah exactly.

552
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,700
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: Used to have a lock when I was 16.

553
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,799
(laughter)

554
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,359
RYAN: I get the internet on this thing, you know.

555
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,879
AMY: I didn't realize we can try talking to him. That makes sense.

556
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,800
KATE: (laughs) KRIS You did it.

557
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,559
JERRY: You were overcome.

558
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,799
JERRY: There was an idyllic forest and you were annihilated. RYAN: I did it!

559
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,299
RYAN: Problem solved. So wait.

560
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:58,519
So can I hear him? Are we conversing to an extent?

561
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,900
KRIS: Yeah I literally was like, why are you here?

562
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,600
JERRY: Yeah, no. You hear him perfectly clear.

563
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:06,019
RYAN: I say, stop whatever you're doing!

564
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,839
You're messing up the forest!

565
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,900
KRIS: (laughs) Smokey.

566
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,800
(laughter)

567
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:12,919
I'm...

568
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:14,759
I'm not...

569
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,259
I didn't do anything. (laughs)

570
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,839
(laughter)

571
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,039
RYAN: Do you need help? KRIS: No, no. I say...

572
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:22,399
KRIS: Not now. (laughter)

573
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,080
(laughter) KATE: I'm busy!

574
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,299
KRIS: Yeah.

575
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,140
KRIS: I'm all right. JERRY: I'm so pleased.

576
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,640
RYAN: All right.

577
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,920
KRIS: Things are good.

578
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,620
RYAN: Okay! JERRY: You think that that might not be true.

579
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:36,139
KATE: They don't seem great.

580
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,500
RYAN: Yeah from this end they don't seem that great!

581
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,720
RYAN: I have divine sense. JERRY: Exactly.

582
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,660
JERRY: Divine Scents from L'Oréal?

583
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,700
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Wow.

584
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,039
RYAN: What will that get me in this? KRIS: (sniffs air)

585
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,380
KRIS: Vitamin B. RYAN: It'll confirm what I'm seeing, I guess.

586
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,140
JERRY: Divine sense is basically... KATE: Can you read the spell for us?

587
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,840
RYAN: Until the end of turn, I can sense undead, fiends, and celestial presence.

588
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,359
KATE: Oh!

589
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,119
RYAN: And I can uh... KRIS: That's very important.

590
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,039
AMY: You can do stuff?

591
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,279
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Holy crap.

592
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,440
JERRY: Yeah do you want to use it? RYAN: Yeah.

593
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,400
JERRY: Oh yeah. Every one of these-- all these cracks-- every one of these cracks...

594
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:10,519
are the same fiendish entity.

595
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,519
RYAN: Hmm.

596
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,900
JERRY: When you have trained to do this...

597
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:18,220
you know it was with minor artifacts...

598
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,740
You know what I mean?

599
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,759
Like you're not...

600
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,920
You have never experienced-- you have never been in the presence of something this all-encompassing...

601
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,620
AMY: On the level? JERRY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Mm-hmm.

602
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,460
KRIS: I'm telling you, he's the real deal.

603
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,360
RYAN: Yeah.

604
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,219
AMY: Didn't I say he was great? RYAN: Oh! Ew. Ugh.

605
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,920
JERRY: But you can feel that in this medium-- RYAN: This is worse than the goddamn magic house we were in!

606
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,519
RYAN: When are we just going to fight like regular old orcs and stuff?

607
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,859
(laughter)

608
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,019
JERRY: There's a period of time where that occurs.

609
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:52,359
But the sort of slivers that you're on, these chunks, they sort of bob in it.

610
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,939
Sort of feels like a floating dock.

611
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,279
RYAN: Hmm. AMY: Ugh.

612
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,420
JERRY: So they do shift and move in this medium.

613
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,240
And then before you in the distance are the different pieces of this gate.

614
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,660
Which you can try to resolve.

615
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,339
Rosie Beestinger. What's going on?

616
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:12,579
KATE: I am fascinated by everything that I see.

617
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,699
because it looks like some crazy astronomical,

618
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,319
meteorological phenomenon that I never read anything about.

619
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,079
JERRY: You think that you can see...

620
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,740
You think that you can see...

621
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,900
stars reflected in it.

622
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,680
KATE: Mm-hmm. JERRY: They're warped. I mean they're the...

623
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,099
they're the...

624
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:35,240
constellations that you know, but they are shifted--

625
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,500
just out of joint in the surface of this sort of canopy.

626
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,480
KATE: So I have the sage background

627
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,339
which basically is just I know where to find almost any piece of information,

628
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,359
I also have this meteorological astronomy thing.

629
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,819
I don't know that those things would help me understand what's going on here.

630
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,859
But I thought I would ask the Dungeon Master.

631
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:58,339
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. If you can-- You want to know if...

632
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,640
KATE: If there's anything that my background in research,

633
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,940
in my monastery reading many, many, many books,

634
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:14,300
if there's any kind of religious text or sacred knowledge that I might have run across that would be familiar here.

635
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,000
JERRY: Well let's take a look. AMY: Is "sacred" be the right word for what we're looking at here?

636
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,299
KATE: Yeah, I mean he seems like he's in some kind of religious thrall, so...

637
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:26,359
JERRY: Exactly. Well here. Let's dish up a history check. Let's see what you get.

638
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,599
KATE: Okay. Let's do it.

639
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,480
That's not great. That's a five.

640
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,799
JERRY: Now, Rosie... KRIS: Do you want to try...

641
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,859
KATE: Oh!

642
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:36,079
KATE: Yes. Sure. Yeah! JERRY: You can absolutely do it.

643
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,759
KATE: Thank you for the advantage dice. RYAN: Forest Friends.

644
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,079
KATE: Here we go. JERRY: Forest Friends are back huh?

645
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,579
KATE: Ten. Not any better. RYAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; AMY: Oh yeah!

646
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:42,579
RYAN: Nice.

647
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:44,159
KRIS: You get to fill these mouths with squirrels! KATE: I'm like, mmm...

648
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,779
RYAN: (laughs) KRIS: Feed them!

649
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:48,539
KATE: I read about a god or two.

650
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:49,779
JERRY: You know about stars, exactly.

651
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:51,399
KATE: I know about some stars. JERRY: So let me see...

652
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,240
JERRY: in terms of...

653
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,299
Okay. Here's how we'll go.

654
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,240
You know...

655
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,940
you have...

656
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,480
heard stories-- you don't know if this is not--

657
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,100
There would be a lot more detail for you later. It might be something you can research.

658
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:07,740
KATE: Okay.

659
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,740
JERRY: But you know that there are...

660
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,880
constellations that sometimes lose stars.

661
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,620
Or have stars replaced in them by other stars.

662
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,700
JERRY: And that process isn't fully understood. KATE: I see.

663
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,460
JERRY: So when you look at this surface and you see these...

664
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:33,500
you see these astronomical phenomenon-- or phenomena-- you are...

665
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,279
It's as though they're from another perspective.

666
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,180
Like this is not how they look. And you know how they look in different hemispheres.

667
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,579
It's the shapes that you know but they are warped.

668
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:46,319
KATE: Okay.

669
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:51,619
KATE: So the knowledge that I gain from this is that we are observing something

670
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:55,899
that is not anywhere on the plane of Earth that we find ourselves in.

671
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,780
JERRY: Yeah it is not-- this is not how things look from--

672
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:02,759
KATE: It's not motherfucking Kansas, is what you're telling me. JERRY: your perspective. Yes.

673
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,619
RYAN: Let's get this Elder god off this motherfucking plane.

674
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:06,459
(laughter)

675
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,960
KATE: So I don't know what that gains us

676
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,159
except that I don't that think K'thriss is in a very good situation.

677
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,779
I think he's very far away from us,

678
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,320
and that potentially these cracks are about to splinter our very existence.

679
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,040
JERRY: That's your feeling. KATE: Yeah.

680
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,000
JERRY: That's your read on the sitch.

681
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,659
KATE: That's my instinct.

682
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,359
RYAN: As I'm shuddering and vomiting from the divine sense.

683
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,960
JERRY: (groans) RYAN: Yeah can confirm.

684
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,119
RYAN: (dry heaving sounds)

685
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,319
KATE: (nasally) From my studies, I can tell you...

686
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,000
AMY: Well actually.

687
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,340
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, exactly. There's got to be a hashtag.

688
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,180
KATE: Can I also take a movement and jump over to join my friends?

689
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,279
JERRY: Easily. Easily. KATE: Or is that too many? Okay.

690
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,860
AMY: The icebergs are drifting apart.

691
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,880
AMY: We're going to have to polar bear it up soon. KATE: So do I even have to roll?

692
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,140
JERRY: No. God.

693
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,839
JERRY: No, no. KATE: (laughs) Stupid question.

694
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,220
JERRY: No, no, grandma. So...

695
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,699
So straight off of the staff.

696
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,119
Just the easiest thing in the world, but when you push off...

697
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,659
it's like a gondola.

698
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,840
Like you push off the other one and it sort of widens.

699
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,800
AMY/KATE: Ooh.

700
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,880
JERRY: And Kris, even more of this false daylight is cast down into this thing.

701
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,840
And you can see K'thriss just sort of bobbing in it.

702
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,079
But it's just darkness.

703
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:22,819
Underneath the ruby's surface it's just this black expanse.

704
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,159
K'thriss Drow'b.

705
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:26,639
Let's play some Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

706
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,159
KRIS: Ooh yeah. Can't wait. RYAN: Wait so is she with us now?

707
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,859
AMY: Yeah. JERRY: Yeah. She's popped over.

708
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,720
RYAN: She lands and I'm just like, so 50/50-- I mean...! 33/33/33!

709
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,859
AMY: She's been there the whole time.

710
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,680
JERRY: You are also real and you can be part of it.

711
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,339
K'thriss Drow'b. What do you got?

712
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,400
So you are basically suspended inside this...

713
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,820
JERRY: entity. KRIS: Right I'm enwombed by this mouth.

714
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,940
JERRY: So you can approach it in any way.

715
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,760
You can reach out with arcana.

716
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,420
You can...

717
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,539
KRIS: Boy! JERRY: You know what I mean? Like--

718
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:57,900
JERRY: You have the-- KRIS: It's a smörgåsbord. Can't wait.

719
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,599
KRIS: What a feast! KATE: Yum yum yum.

720
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,940
JERRY: Yeah I'm excited to see how you contend with it.

721
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,400
KRIS: I want to-- well first of all I want to attempt to speak with it again telepathically.

722
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:14,360
So I ask-- I'm speaking to the mouth ball.

723
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,160
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: Are you an aspect of it?

724
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,579
JERRY: An aspect-- Oh of...

725
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,880
JERRY: You want to know if it's an aspect of the-- KRIS: Right it spoke of certain...

726
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:28,339
KRIS: portions of itself as being disappointed.

727
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,840
I want to know am I dealing with a specific aspect of it right now.

728
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,179
I'm not talking to the big boy, apparently.

729
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:36,719
Or maybe I am.

730
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,419
KATE: Is your god named Big Boy? KRIS: He's Big Boy.

731
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,320
JERRY: Yeah and André 3000.

732
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,620
JERRY: It's like-- this is the-- in the pantheon of the Acquisitions Incorporated universe...

733
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:49,199
they're in constantly opposed poles-- No.

734
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,099
KATE: They fight at their whim.

735
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:52,860
JERRY: That's not canonical. KRIS: He's an Outkast.

736
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,200
JERRY: That's not canonical.

737
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,219
KRIS: It makes sense.

738
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,759
KRIS: That was for the-- KATE: (laughing) That was good.

739
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,820
(laughter)

740
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,180
AMY: Just to clarify.

741
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:05,619
JERRY: It says...

742
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,660
"I am its unified heart."

743
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,320
KRIS: That's good news for me.

744
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:14,980
AMY: Aww it kept you in its heart. RYAN: Yeah.

745
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
RYAN: Hearts love Valentines.

746
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,539
JERRY: Yeah exactly. KATE: Oh! We can solve this puzzle. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

747
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,059
AMY: With love. KATE: Candy.

748
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:21,039
AMY: Oh. KATE: Right. Love.

749
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,779
JERRY: So like I say, do you want to reach out and try to assess it?

750
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,619
KRIS: Yeah, let me-- let's try and do some of that.

751
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:31,359
Now that I-- It's good to know that it will correspond with me.

752
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,960
KRIS: So let me... JERRY: Yeah pen-pals.

753
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,840
RYAN: Are you still fighting it off as he's doing this?

754
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,280
AMY: No, he loves it! Look at him! He loves it! RYAN: Is it still like...?

755
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,380
JERRY: He's soaking in it like Palmolive. Or whatever the opposite of Palmolive is.

756
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,760
You are not being moistened by this.

757
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,080
KRIS: Ooh. JERRY: No, you're being desiccated.

758
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,620
KRIS: Let me do... deception-- No.

759
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,660
KRIS: Let me do arcana. JERRY: Yeah. yeah.

760
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,619
KRIS: Let's see what I got.

761
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,059
Actually let me try religion because I'm a little higher there.

762
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:55,900
Let me see what I get--

763
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,700
KRIS/KATE: Ooh!

764
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:58,199
KRIS: It's a 20, my friend. KATE: That's a nat 20.

765
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,819
JERRY: It's a 20? Oh Jesus. KRIS: It's a natural 20, my friend.

766
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,660
KRIS: Get me up-- Tell me the endgame. KATE: You're going to write it.

767
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:04,079
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: (laughing) Tell me the endgame.

768
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,960
JERRY: So when you're 20th level... here's what happens.

769
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,599
KRIS: Here's what goes up.

770
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,579
JERRY: So it's-- you're holding-- it's almost like a water wing.

771
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,519
Like you're holding on to this chunk of the altar...

772
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,900
and it is always trying to get between you and it.

773
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:22,219
KRIS: Oh it's not just warded away by it, it's trying to take it from me.

774
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:28,799
JERRY: This is the only thing that is allowing you to be here and exist in this context at all.

775
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,980
And you can tell that there is a part of it...

776
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,280
whenever this fluid passes over the symbol...

777
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,940
it retracts instantly.

778
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,660
JERRY: But it seems to forget this every five seconds or so. KRIS: Right.

779
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:51,099
JERRY: It's always trying again and always learning that that doesn't work.

780
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,460
And...

781
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,860
what you perceive from the iconography-- from the religious iconography...

782
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,360
you think that the symbol on your stone...

783
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:06,219
can't possibly refer to this thing.

784
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,460
KRIS: Oh... yeah.

785
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,659
Seems like it wouldn't mind its own name.

786
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,980
JERRY: Yeah. As a relic you're like...

787
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,880
As one of its artifacts it would adore it.

788
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:21,039
It would protect it and nurture it.

789
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,339
And what it's actually trying to do is...

790
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,799
port it out and forcibly separate you from it.

791
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,480
So that symbol does not reflect--

792
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,880
That symbol is not the name of this thing.

793
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
KRIS: Oh. All right well... JERRY: Whatever it is.

794
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,019
KRIS: Now I'm less excited.

795
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:39,039
JERRY: Yeah.

796
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:42,519
KRIS: So I go from adulation to like, whoa! What?

797
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,400
JERRY: No, no. It gets worse. AMY: Yucky.

798
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,860
JERRY: Yeah. Walnut Dankgrass. Let's play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

799
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,980
AMY: Yeah... Walnut's like...

800
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,719
Wow the AI screening process for interns is super rigorous!

801
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,079
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Huh!

802
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,940
AMY: Um... Okay! JERRY: How does anyone get through?

803
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,539
KATE: She goes from stunned to like pithy one-liners.

804
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,599
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KATE: Damn it, Walnut.

805
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:05,119
KRIS: May I add a little flavor by the way? AMY: Yeah.

806
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,699
KRIS: Like you've-- after this has occurred and I'm now aware that

807
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:11,379
I don't audience with what I want to have audience with.

808
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,140
AMY: Yeah.

809
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,539
KRIS: I go from like,

810
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:16,440
No, no. I'm doing-- Let me see what's going on.

811
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,380
To I'm just like shouting. I'm shrieking.

812
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,500
KRIS: No! No! This is not what I want anymore. JERRY: No, it's the worst. It's the worst.

813
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,960
JERRY: Now. Walnut, I want to emphasize a couple of things to you.

814
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,359
Okay? So everybody has got cool shit.

815
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,380
AMY: Hmm!

816
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,780
JERRY: Boons and banes from the channel...

817
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,740
AMY: Ooh so many Forest Friends.

818
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,500
KATE: So many Forest Friends.

819
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,480
JERRY: You can kick in-- People can put in cheers and those bits work up towards specials.

820
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,039
So Donaar gets a re-- get you re-juiced.

821
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,659
Just sacs of acid filled back up.

822
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,579
RYAN: Yeah because I'm still empty right? Because like we jumped right through the portal.

823
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,139
JERRY: Exactly. KATE: You blew an acid load.

824
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:54,379
JERRY: Waln-- So to speak.

825
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,260
RYAN: I need a nap.

826
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,400
JERRY: Walnut-- Refractory period!

827
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,800
Walnut, Forest Friends.

828
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,039
It looks like the Forest Friends were pretty entertaining...

829
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,440
KATE: (whispering) Oh my god. JERRY: to them last time, so you got a couple.

830
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,139
RYAN: You're just a squirrel geyser.

831
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:08,379
JERRY: Yeah exactly. KRIS: Pour some Friends into this.

832
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,619
JERRY: Squirrel cannon! KATE: Squirrel geyser.

833
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:11,699
AMY: Yeah. JERRY: Squirrel Cannon. Squirrel Shotgun.

834
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:17,900
Rosie has Back in My Day so you can basically grant her

835
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:23,319
a skill roll proficiency in one skill or tool for one roll.

836
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,440
Just remembers her prodigious experience.

837
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:35,179
And then K'thriss can consult his icon and gain the effects of Augury.

838
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:38,579
Which is basically like, "Should we do this? Should we not do this?" type thing.

839
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,980
KRIS: That would be-- RYAN: I was going to say that'd be great.

840
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,840
JERRY: It's the Cthulhu version of the Magic 8-Ball.

841
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,920
AMY: It's called a hint!

842
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,460
JERRY: Exactly. AMY: And I didn't even get one.

843
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,960
JERRY: But the main thing, Walnut, that I wanted to emphasize to you

844
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,720
is that you have got Forest Friends.

845
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,480
JERRY: I just want to make sure you do not miss them. AMY: Oh I'm lousy with Forest Friends. I see.

846
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,179
AMY: Let me ask you a question with the Forest Friends, because I don't know.

847
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:03,320
Is there a limit on what kind of little Forest Friends?

848
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,800
Do they have to be tiny? What's the size class?

849
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,620
JERRY: It is a sudden swarm of small animals that scurry out of nowhere.

850
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:13,639
AMY: Scurry out of nowhere. JERRY: If your suggestion is cool I can take it.

851
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,279
JERRY: But we can also go-- KATE: How rad is it?

852
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,000
KRIS: Small compared to us or like a god?

853
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,519
AMY: Have you seen the movie Up?

854
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,679
And can birds airlift him out of there-- (laughing) No! I'm sorry! I can't!

855
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,739
KATE: Continue down this path,

856
00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:29,239
KATE: It's Dungeons &amp; Dragons. JERRY: Yeah continue--

857
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:32,459
JERRY: to investigate it. AMY: Can we Operation Dumbo Drop K'thriss--

858
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,900
RYAN: A bunch of snakes make a rope... AMY: from his...

859
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
AMY: (laughs) Yeah. No. I mean I have rope.

860
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,339
JERRY: Yeah but that's not snake rope.

861
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,539
JERRY: Fuck that. AMY: No I'm just wondering if I have like you know...

862
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:45,480
AMY: a bunch of like birds that can lift him out.

863
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,519
KRIS: I like-- I like-- the snakes. You're like, grab the snakes!

864
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:49,579
And I go, always!

865
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:50,500
(laughter)

866
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,780
JERRY: 100%! AMY: You bet! Nom nom nom.

867
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,780
AMY: No, no, no. KRIS: Okay what are we doing?

868
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,280
RYAN: I like the idea that they're loosely tied together

869
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,000
RYAN: and you throw them they just come apart. AMY: I'm trying to think of a helpful animal--

870
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,559
RYAN: And just drift in this... AMY: that would be good in this situation.

871
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:01,079
KATE: What's the muscliest bird?

872
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,139
AMY: The muscliest bird? RYAN: Oh the muscle bird.

873
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:04,839
KATE: Amy knows a lot about birds!

874
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,720
RYAN: From New Zealand. AMY: (sighs) What would be a good one?

875
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,859
KATE: A good, buff bird. RYAN: It's like a flying bicep.

876
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,760
KATE: You know those birds with arms that they would--

877
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,600
JERRY: A bicep with two wings?

878
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,759
AMY: Yeah it's like a sparrow but with-- KATE: Yeah, super jacked.

879
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,620
JERRY: So like a ripped-- AMY: I don't know, something like...

880
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:18,859
JERRY: A ripped ass bird?

881
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,180
AMY: Just like some-- I mean I saw some eagles fighting on Planet Earth 2.

882
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:23,279
KATE: What about a swarm of eagles?

883
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,460
AMY: Yeah can I just get nasty with eagles?

884
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,519
KATE: Just some really gnarly eagles. AMY: I don't want to waste it! I don't want it to be like,

885
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,099
AMY: I summon a bunch of eagles. And you're like, cool. Two sparrows come out.

886
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,860
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, half of one sparrow. RYAN: And they claw his face.

887
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,600
JERRY: No, no, no. This is the sort of thing that, you know, we want to use.

888
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:42,500
AMY: Mmm okay. JERRY: I want this to happen.

889
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,440
KATE: What's your favorite kind of eagle, Walnut?

890
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,940
AMY: Um... Oh I mean there's so many. KATE: That's a tough choice. I know, I know.

891
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,960
AMY: I mean I do like golden eagles the most.

892
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,059
Also in fantasy stories, a lot of times eagles help out people that are in trouble

893
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:57,980
and don't know what to do when you need to retcon ourselves out of the situation.

894
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,360
JERRY: Yeah exactly. It's like, oh shit yes. Send the king.

895
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,280
Why not? Why not send the king of the eagles?

896
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,260
RYAN: Deus ex eagle?

897
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:09,180
AMY: I would like to try and do this. We'll see what happens. We'll all learn together.

898
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,160
I'd like to search deep inside of myself

899
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,099
and summon up these Forest Friends and wish so hard for eagles!

900
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:19,719
(laughter) AMY: For big birds!

901
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:22,159
KRIS: Please. AMY: Come help my good, good drow boy.

902
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,720
AMY: Who is just drowning in goo.

903
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:26,359
JERRY/KRIS: Yeah.

904
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:33,599
AMY: If you're screaming and also I think that maybe you being in there is like a wrench in two cogs of a clock.

905
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,940
And if I can just get you out of there--

906
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,400
AMY: it'll just go back? KRIS: Yeah maybe it'll go back. &gt;&gt; KATE: Maybe, yeah!

907
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,039
JERRY: I like it so-- KATE: (straining) I wish for eagles!

908
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:41,400
JERRY: So yeah exactly. So...

909
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,800
So like from the vanishing point of all these shards...

910
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,719
you hear a screech.

911
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:53,319
And seven eagles... come out.

912
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,460
You can see them sort of reflected against all these edges.

913
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,860
And for whatever reason they don't seem too weirded out.

914
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:02,679
(laughter)

915
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:03,579
AMY: They're used to this.

916
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:06,259
JERRY: You'd think there'd be some reaction.

917
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,160
AMY: Yeah.

918
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:14,760
JERRY: So they come out and they perch on the edge and they're looking down at the situation.

919
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,340
How do you want to guide these Forest Friends?

920
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,960
AMY: I want to...

921
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,640
point to K'thriss.

922
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:27,359
And I want to say, you know,

923
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:29,839
Bring him to us! Get him out of there.

924
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,200
KATE: Get him. Get him. AMY: Sic him! Sic him, boy! Sic him!

925
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,039
AMY: No. &gt;&gt; KATE: Get that drow. KRIS: These eagles are biting me!

926
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,079
(laughter) AMY: Ah!

927
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,420
AMY: They get excited about your sigil and take it away! No.

928
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,039
AMY: Ah! K'thriss is devoured.

929
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,940
JERRY: They bring it up into their nest. AMY: They bring it to me!

930
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,059
JERRY: And they just rest on it. They feel good.

931
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:47,920
AMY/KRIS: Yeah.

932
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,440
KRIS: The sigil, you're like, that's a good thing to have.

933
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,420
Those mouths don't like it.

934
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,880
Let's get it! And he gets what he wants, we get what we want...

935
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,720
AMY: No, I want to point at K'thriss with urgency.

936
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,180
Like almost psionically imploring them to help.

937
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,359
KATE: Right. KRIS: Yeah.

938
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,640
KATE: I'm going to watch you and be like, man I should have gone to druid school.

939
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,519
AMY: (laughs) KATE: This is so cool.

940
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:12,239
JERRY: So they leap into action at your direction.

941
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:14,299
AMY: Please don't kill these eagles, Jerry.

942
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,180
JERRY: Oh they're dead.

943
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,699
(laughter)

944
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:19,879
JERRY: Yeah this is like a chipper shredder but just for big birds.

945
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,119
AMY: Mmm. Okay.

946
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,960
JERRY: It gets advantage on liquifying birds.

947
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,880
(laughter)

948
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,140
JERRY: It has bird liquefier... KATE: It's written there.

949
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:29,579
KRIS: Smaller birds might have made it.

950
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,299
AMY: That's also on the menu right next to Jim and Tonic.

951
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,660
KRIS: Just the right size.

952
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:36,079
JERRY: No, no. It's like a conical burr.

953
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,659
One part of the bird goes in and it's goes-- (grinding sound)

954
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,519
No. Nothing like that happens.

955
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,739
AMY: Good because that's my nightmare.

956
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:44,859
JERRY: No, so the first one...

957
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:49,259
swoops down and is able to sort of catch the hem of his sleeve...

958
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,880
and sort of drags him through this...

959
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:55,799
JERRY: It's viscous, but it's not solid. AMY: Mm-hmm. Okay.

960
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,480
KRIS: And I don't know where this eagle suddenly showed up out of.

961
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,260
JERRY: No. All of a sudden a bird grabs part of your robe

962
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:05,620
and starts dragging you toward this dark shore

963
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:10,059
that you can sort of see in the edge of this field.

964
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:11,679
KRIS: And I say, g-good bird!

965
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:12,980
(laughter)

966
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,659
JERRY: The next one-- RYAN: So the birds are swimming?

967
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:18,699
JERRY: Yeah exactly. So the next one flies down...

968
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:25,139
and then it almost like it gets ensorcelled by the reflection of itself in the surface...

969
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:28,579
and just smashes headlong into it.

970
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,380
AMY: Good bird. JERRY: So it gets up briefly.

971
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,240
JERRY: Sort of like, have you seen like a puppy on a...

972
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:35,939
AMY: Yes of course. JERRY: frozen puddle?

973
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,039
AMY: Yes. JERRY: Like that.

974
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,039
JERRY: And there's a few of these scratches, and then it just disappears...

975
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:42,300
AMY: Oh no. JERRY: into it.

976
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,640
AMY: You're rolling for all my eagles? KATE: I liked them. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Ugh.

977
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,619
JERRY: No, no. It's all right. The next one is able to swoop in after the last one.

978
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:51,500
Grab the hem and continue to drag him closer.

979
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,240
All right. You're good.

980
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:56,419
KRIS: Whew. JERRY: The last one was able-- they're basically like...

981
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,019
JERRY: pulling and letting go and the next one pulls down. AMY: Ah gotcha.

982
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:02,259
JERRY: Like it's-- It's like they drilled on this somehow.

983
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,920
AMY: These are actually from different fantasy IPs.

984
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,059
JERRY: Yeah exactly. It's all the best eagles.

985
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,840
AMY: All your favorite eagles! KATE: All-star eagles!

986
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,579
AMY: Now that's what I call eagle.

987
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:12,579
AMY: Seven.

988
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:15,719
JERRY: Volume Seven. We've got like Gwaihir...

989
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:17,859
We got them all! We're ready to go.

990
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,019
AMY: Marahute.

991
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:20,239
JERRY: You pull...

992
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,220
KATE: I hear you. I see you. RYAN: I don't know what that--

993
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:26,319
JERRY: The last one pulls you toward this sort of like border.

994
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,700
You can see like a dark mist border.

995
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,039
And then as soon as you're pulled to the edge of it...

996
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,940
you can see-- sort of again, like sort of like off of a dock...

997
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:41,299
Like you can reach up and see this sheared edge of the reel.

998
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,400
You can see sort of like a forest canopy,

999
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:50,160
but you can see everywhere inside these furrows this entity.

1000
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:52,940
This creature that you have somehow sworn yourself to.

1001
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,740
KRIS: Yeah.

1002
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,040
JERRY: So on your turn, you think that you can possibly grab that edge and pull yourself up.

1003
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:00,699
KRIS: Okay. JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen.

1004
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:04,079
RYAN: Uh... so you're almost out?

1005
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,759
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. AMY: I'm so nervous.

1006
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,080
RYAN: I don't know if I want to reach in there and get him.

1007
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,360
JERRY: Please do. &gt;&gt; KATE: Just get him! AMY: Just grab him by the scruff of his neck.

1008
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,519
JERRY: Please do! I want that.

1009
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,939
RYAN: I'm afraid I'm going to get sucked in or something.

1010
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,320
JERRY: I've been waiting for this.

1011
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,420
RYAN: I have a climber's kit. KATE: I turn to Walnut. You got to boss eagles around.

1012
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,980
KATE: So I turn to Donaar, I'm like, sic him.

1013
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,119
(laughter)

1014
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,699
KATE: Get him, boy. RYAN: You got that rope, right?

1015
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:27,659
AMY: I do. RYAN: I say, can I have that rope?

1016
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:29,719
KATE: Is it made of snakes? It's a normal rope. AMY: 50 feet hempen rope.

1017
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:32,159
KATE: Normal rope. Wow. Okay RYAN: 50 feet of rope. All right.

1018
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,319
KRIS: I'm so touched you guys are going to come in here and all that.

1019
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,820
The eagles did a lot of that work.

1020
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,760
RYAN: All right I say...

1021
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,780
Do you still want to get out?

1022
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,920
(laughter)

1023
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,619
KRIS: Yep! Yep! Yep! Yes! Yes. Yes. RYAN: Are you good? All right.

1024
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,900
(laughter) RYAN: And then I dangle this rope.

1025
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,579
I say, here you go!

1026
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,160
RYAN: It's just like... JERRY: Here so...

1027
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,819
RYAN: Grab it. KRIS: I need more than the end.

1028
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,760
JERRY: So as you near the edge and dangle the rope over...

1029
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,659
something glints off of the undulating surface of this.

1030
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:03,420
It's all right. It's cool.

1031
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,940
JERRY: I need a wisdom check from you. AMY/KATE: Oh no.

1032
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,980
AMY: Not from Donaar.

1033
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,219
RYAN: No, my wisdom is all right.

1034
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:11,559
JERRY: It's great.

1035
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,840
RYAN: It's normal.

1036
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,320
RYAN: 16. KATE: Hey!

1037
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,940
JERRY: It's great.

1038
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,440
You can feel yourself on the edge of this as you dangle it over.

1039
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,539
You can feel yourself just drawn into it.

1040
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,740
And like for a second your foot moves...

1041
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:30,119
in preparation to...

1042
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,460
swim in this.

1043
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,180
And then you sort of catch your back foot.

1044
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:40,739
You dig your heel into the edge of the strut that you're on.

1045
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,279
JERRY: So that's-- RYAN: Could have been bad.

1046
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,600
(laughter)

1047
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,579
JERRY: No it's supposed to be bad.

1048
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:45,500
KATE: Whew. AMY: Lucky roll.

1049
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,780
JERRY: Rosie Beestinger.

1050
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:48,900
How can I help?

1051
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,940
KATE: Okay so the situation is that Donaar is dangling a rope that K'thriss has yet to grab.

1052
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,139
JERRY: Exactly. Kris-- RYAN: Yeah the ingrate.

1053
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:57,579
RYAN: Got a rope right there for you.

1054
00:50:57,579 --> 00:50:58,480
KATE: Okay.

1055
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,300
JERRY: You've-- I mean you've seen a lot in your 120 years.

1056
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,820
KATE: I sure as hell have. JERRY: He is not present.

1057
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:09,519
KATE: Hmm. JERRY: He is just-- sort of like a bottle.

1058
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:11,699
JERRY: Just bobbing in this muck.

1059
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:14,960
KATE: I see. Okay so he doesn't look like he's got a consciousness to him?

1060
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,539
JERRY: Well he just looks like he's just not... like he's checked out.

1061
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:23,360
KATE: Okay. JERRY: Like he's just completely on some other shit.

1062
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,519
KATE: Can I reach down and just like slap him?

1063
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,600
KATE: Try to-- RYAN: Don't reach in.

1064
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:30,940
KRIS: If you can reach down to slap me why don't you yank me out?

1065
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,220
KATE: Okay-- JERRY: Please do that.

1066
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:35,879
KATE: I'll stick my quarterstaff there and try to like bonk some sense into him gently.

1067
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,119
JERRY: Okay as you reach over the edge with the staff...

1068
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:44,559
I need a... wisdom... ability...

1069
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,239
KATE: Yeah I got some wisdom. RYAN: Don't go crazy.

1070
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,979
KATE: I got some wisdom. KRIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,019
KATE: I got that. I got that. RYAN: Wisen up.

1072
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:50,500
KATE: That's an 11. JERRY: 11?

1073
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,559
KATE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; AMY: Aww... JERRY: K. That's enough.

1074
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:53,179
RYAN: Oh... JERRY: That's enough. That's enough.

1075
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:56,319
KATE: Whew! Skating right over-- AMY: Well she lived a good life.

1076
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,820
JERRY: You know, it's the crevice. Right? It's the crevice.

1077
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,140
KATE: I see. JERRY: You're exposed to the whole thing is a different story.

1078
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:02,699
JERRY: So rope is hanging out...

1079
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,480
there's a bo staff...

1080
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,820
This is a very important decision for you K'thriss Drow'b.

1081
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,180
KRIS: (grunts) JERRY: Whose aid will you accept?

1082
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,039
RYAN: It's redundant. KATE: Oh I'm not trying to help.

1083
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:11,759
JERRY: Oh!

1084
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,160
RYAN: Oh you're just trying to hit him in the face.

1085
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:14,559
KRIS: She's trying to like prod me. JERRY: Oh you're trying to poke him?

1086
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,299
KATE: Yeah I just want to like wake him up a little bit.

1087
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,320
KATE: I want to make sure that like-- you know just slap some sense.

1088
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,620
JERRY: So you just give him a tap on the head?

1089
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:23,139
RYAN: Just don't let him know who's boss.

1090
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,379
AMY: Like a kid poking a dead body by the sea.

1091
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,840
KATE: Yeah. So I'm fascinated by this.

1092
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,000
So I'm like, huh! (laughs)

1093
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,420
JERRY: As though from a great distance...

1094
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,940
from you-- in your perception...

1095
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,579
you just see this rod, just coming at you.

1096
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:40,579
And it's like-- have you ever seen the movie Antichrist?

1097
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:42,920
KRIS: Probably. JERRY: Like the initial shower scene?

1098
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:44,279
KRIS: Yes. KATE: Missed that one.

1099
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,660
JERRY: It's like that.

1100
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:49,579
JERRY: Like this rod is coming down forever. RYAN: I don't get that reference.

1101
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:53,219
JERRY: And then it comes into contract with your forehead.

1102
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:56,099
AMY: Oh. JERRY: And then it nudges you back.

1103
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:57,759
KRIS: (laughs) JERRY: And then...

1104
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,659
JERRY: when it pulls back away...

1105
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,980
Now you're in real time again.

1106
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,719
KRIS: Oh okay.

1107
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:05,299
KRIS: (sound of surprise) Whoa!

1108
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,860
JERRY: So you're just slipping and bobbing in this muck.

1109
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:15,079
Right above your head is a-- like would play with a cat, I assume... you're dangling a rope.

1110
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:17,480
KATE: Do I see any difference after my...? RYAN: Just smacking you in the face with it.

1111
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,179
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. He's blinking. KATE: Okay.

1112
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:20,460
KATE: Nice. KRIS: We're back.

1113
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,099
KATE: We're back. JERRY: He's remembered how to blink.

1114
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:23,279
KATE: Okay. Excellent.

1115
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:26,659
KRIS: Okay. On to me. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

1116
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:27,759
JERRY: It's on to you, K'thriss Drow'b.

1117
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,700
KRIS: I swim back to that mouth cave--

1118
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:31,779
(laughter) KRIS: so I can get some more of those secrets.

1119
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,580
(laughter) JERRY: Some more of that juice!

1120
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:35,679
KRIS: Just get this rope out of here. JERRY: You can if you want.

1121
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,739
KRIS: No I just... pull you down. RYAN: Yeah.

1122
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:39,079
JERRY: This is Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

1123
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:41,179
AMY: Join me! JERRY: If that's how you want to do it,

1124
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:42,699
JERRY: that's a legitimate thing you can do. KATE: Is that K'thriss' thing?

1125
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:44,019
KRIS: If this was my--

1126
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:45,500
AMY: If we were all playing abysmal characters. KATE: If it was your Big Boy.

1127
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,840
KRIS: If it was my guy I would have gone for it. But not this time.

1128
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,680
KRIS: Um... Yeah I'm going to take a hold of this rope. JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Get a hold of it.

1129
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:54,039
JERRY: He's massive!

1130
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:55,759
JERRY: And strong. If you-- KRIS: Yeah. He seems like it.

1131
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,220
JERRY: get a hold of this rope, we're not talking about rolls and checks.

1132
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:01,559
We're talking about you coming up out of this fucking shit.

1133
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,619
RYAN: Saving throw because I'm going to pull you so hard you're going to fly in the air.

1134
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,859
KRIS: Let's get it done.

1135
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,019
JERRY: You're going to take damage. KRIS: I'm going to do that.

1136
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:10,320
KATE: Let's get the hell out of here. JERRY: Yeah he wraps his...

1137
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,340
JERRY: he wraps his...

1138
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,360
RYAN: Little noodle arms around it. JERRY: Yeah exactly.

1139
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,000
KRIS: Like I'm not big.

1140
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,699
JERRY: Yeah exact-- No this... It's... KRIS: I'm still an elf. Of sorts.

1141
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:19,559
JERRY: It's... irrelevant.

1142
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:22,779
Like he has an irrelevant weight to you.

1143
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,840
KRIS: In fact the only you pull on the rope is to get the rope back.

1144
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,600
RYAN: Yeah. An eagle can carry you. They're not that big.

1145
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,480
(laughter) JERRY: You just drag him through.

1146
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,360
AMY: That's a good rope! It was my grandmother's rope.

1147
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,200
JERRY: Just like with one hand.

1148
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:37,159
It's just like pull him up and you're aleady done. You're already done with this shit.

1149
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:38,839
RYAN: I say, everyone, watch this! (grunts)

1150
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:41,480
And then I say...

1151
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,440
Look at how strong I am, everyone. I'm so great.

1152
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,579
(laughter)

1153
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,759
KRIS: And I come tumbling out of there. RYAN: And I say, right?

1154
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:49,400
KRIS: Ye-- RYAN: And you take too long and I dip you back in again.

1155
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,840
(laughter) RYAN: And I take you back out and I say...

1156
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,220
RYAN: I'm the best, right? KRIS: I think you can get--

1157
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:54,759
RYAN: Too late. Sorry, back down again.

1158
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,000
KRIS: Any-- any kind of-- RYAN: And I wait and I say--

1159
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,920
RYAN: Who's the strongest and the best?

1160
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,440
KRIS: This... boy-- RYAN: Too long! Back down!

1161
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,780
RYAN: We'll do it one more time.

1162
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,860
RYAN: Who's the strongest and the best? KRIS: (strained yelling) Donaar!

1163
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,200
RYAN: Ah ah that's better!

1164
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:06,859
(laughter) JERRY: Good stuff. Just over!

1165
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,260
KRIS: I was going to say, any confession you could get out of me at that point.

1166
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,460
Like you put-- Who's the best?

1167
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,619
You! Anybody! Yes. Not me! Whatever you want me to say!

1168
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:17,099
JERRY: Any non-me entity!

1169
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:19,679
KRIS: Is it me? Do you want me to be it? I'll say yes-- RYAN: No!

1170
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:21,879
RYAN: It's me! I'm the best! KRIS: It's you. You for sure!

1171
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,940
JERRY: So you have dragged him out.

1172
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,180
Just flopped him down. I mean like a...

1173
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:31,440
like when you keep all the fish just sort of on that chain and then you just like-- (grunt).

1174
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,599
You're done with that. Now you're on to your next shit.

1175
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,800
JERRY: K'thriss is out. Walnut. RYAN: And I take a nap.

1176
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,100
JERRY: We are back at the top. AMY: Sure.

1177
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,400
JERRY: But there is something about that...

1178
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,900
AMY: That portal. RYAN: Mary.

1179
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,860
JERRY: that does not-- There's something about where Kris was drawn up out of...

1180
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:48,579
AMY: Mmm.

1181
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,480
JERRY: You can see it creeping over the edge...

1182
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,400
AMY: Mm-mmm! KRIS: Oh...

1183
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,280
JERRY: and moving in.

1184
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,000
But your situation right now is that this is creeping up.

1185
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:57,659
And you can try to find some way...

1186
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:02,779
to get this configuration back together so that you can get the fuck out of here.

1187
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:07,879
AMY: Yeah... Okay so we need to get to the portal.

1188
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,300
AMY: Where's the-- is this like... JERRY: It's job one.

1189
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,660
AMY: Job one. Right.

1190
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:14,659
How far is the next thing? Jumpable?

1191
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:17,139
JERRY: Well these are all like slivers.

1192
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:21,019
They all sort of erupt out from the vanishing point in the middle.

1193
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,980
AMY: I'm trying to get this-- JERRY: So you can--

1194
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,579
JERRY: Imagine there's all sort of like...

1195
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,619
pie, like pizza wedges.

1196
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:29,440
JERRY: That's sort of joined at the point. AMY: Oh I'm imagining it.

1197
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,340
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KRIS: Yeah.

1198
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,279
KATE: And it would be very illogical for us to run there.

1199
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:38,519
JERRY: Well you can run there, but once you got there-- you can run there and get a better look at it...

1200
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:46,039
Once you got there, there still needs to be something to arrange these slices that are sort of bobbing in this fluid.

1201
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:46,779
KATE: Okay.

1202
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:50,220
JERRY: But yeah, getting up there and investigating it is a great plan.

1203
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:52,739
AMY: Okay great. Well one, I...

1204
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:56,859
Walnut just whisper a little prayer for that eagle that got sucked into the thing.

1205
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,340
KATE: Moment of silence?

1206
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,780
AMY: Yeah just a moment of silence-- (laughs)

1207
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,620
JERRY: One moment. One moment please.

1208
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:03,940
AMY: And then-- KRIS: I'm still screaming by the way.

1209
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,280
(laughter)

1210
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,540
AMY: I still respectfully bow my head, then I just look at you kind of angrily.

1211
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:17,760
Okay so then I want to look at the-- I mean I want to start moving towards the portal.

1212
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,660
And I want to get as close as I can in my-- You know my speed is only 35.

1213
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:23,619
JERRY: Yeah absolutely. I mean it's not far.

1214
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:24,639
AMY: It's not far? Okay.

1215
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:27,480
JERRY: Because space is not working. AMY: Because of the way that it is. Right, right, right.

1216
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,699
JERRY: It is not-- The green light is not on this device.

1217
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:38,740
You are walking out sort of on these long, sharpening pontoons toward this.

1218
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:43,239
And then near the-- obviously near the end it's almost like pick-up sticks.

1219
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:51,159
It's just like this ring of sharp points that are just offset a little bit.

1220
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,160
AMY: Okay.

1221
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:54,960
Would uh...

1222
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:59,579
AMY: I'm so scared to touch them. JERRY: Yeah. That's reasonable.

1223
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:03,019
JERRY: Impossibly sharp teeth of the universe.

1224
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:04,380
AMY: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. JERRY: Maybe. I don't know.

1225
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:09,420
AMY: Can I do a perception check to see if there'd be a place that I could feel like I could nudge one with something?

1226
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,519
JERRY: Yeah absolutely.

1227
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:14,179
AMY: All right. Cool. I have good perception so let's give it a shot.

1228
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,099
17?

1229
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,440
JERRY: Oh yeah! Absolutely.

1230
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think that-- I mean...

1231
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,460
It's strange, but these shards are physical.

1232
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,760
AMY: Okay. JERRY: They could be bound together,

1233
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,520
AMY: Okay. JERRY: the cracks could be sealed, I mean--

1234
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:34,400
JERRY: you have a bunch of ways to approach this-- AMY: Okay great.

1235
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,840
JERRY: as a physical problem.

1236
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,980
AMY: Okay.

1237
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,260
So then I look back to the rest of you guys and I go,

1238
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,199
Uh... Let's get the hell out of here!

1239
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,079
Help me put this thing--

1240
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,160
(laughing) Help me put this shit together.

1241
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,319
(laughter)

1242
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,200
RYAN: Put the world back together? AMY: Yeah. Please.

1243
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:54,579
JERRY: Yeah. Walnut does not sound a hundred percent okay.

1244
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,960
KATE: Hmm...

1245
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,720
AMY: Suffered another terrifying animal loss today.

1246
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,219
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Everyday is harder than the last.

1247
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:05,139
Do you want to make some attempt to resolve this?

1248
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:08,319
AMY: Yeah can I try and lash it together with this goopy rope I got?

1249
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,340
JERRY: Yeah! AMY: Cool.

1250
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,140
AMY: What do I do? RYAN: I give you the rope back.

1251
00:59:11,139 --> 00:59:12,000
AMY: Yeah. RYAN: Here you go.

1252
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,519
AMY: Literally my grandmother's rope.

1253
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,480
(shudders)

1254
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,840
RYAN: Came in very handy.

1255
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,200
RYAN: We got our vagrant back. AMY: Smoothing down some of the fibers.

1256
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:22,079
KRIS: Frayed edge? You're like, there you go.

1257
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,099
KATE: I'm sorry, meemaw.

1258
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:25,000
AMY: I'm sorry, meemaw. (kissing sound)

1259
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,579
Yeah can I try lashing it together. Can I like roll for it?

1260
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:29,659
Would that be something?

1261
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:31,159
JERRY: Yeah I would say survival. AMY: Survival?

1262
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,880
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: Great. Something I'm proficient in!

1263
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,760
JERRY: Well it's a net sort of knot continuum.

1264
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,619
AMY: Uh... nope! That's all I got. Seven.

1265
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:42,559
JERRY: All right. So you're looping it around these edges.

1266
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,320
And then you make the knot that you remember going this way.

1267
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,280
It's like forgetting how to tie a tie, type thing.

1268
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,380
AMY: Yeah and then it just comes apart. JERRY: Ordinarily you would look at YouTube.

1269
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,160
JERRY: Right? AMY: Sure.

1270
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,379
JERRY: But it hasn't been invented.

1271
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,500
JERRY: So as you cinch it-- RYAN: That's how they get you.

1272
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,820
JERRY: It shreds and splits on the teeth of these--

1273
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,700
AMY: No!

1274
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,500
JERRY: Just the front part. It's okay.

1275
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,800
AMY: Okay. Done with Walnut's turn. JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen.

1276
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,700
RYAN: Uh... god.

1277
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:08,019
JERRY: So there's different situations. You can try to cinch it up back here.

1278
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:09,480
Try to cinch it up front.

1279
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,080
RYAN: What does cinching it up entail?

1280
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,699
JERRY: Basically we have physical objects-- RYAN: Yeah.

1281
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,239
JERRY: that have to be shifted and/or moved. RYAN: Well I'm big and strong.

1282
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,179
AMY: Do you have glue?

1283
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:20,519
RYAN: Do I have glue? No.

1284
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:22,539
KATE: I have a bag of sand. RYAN: I have a toothbrush.

1285
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:25,179
AMY: Can I summon animals to make... glue? (laughs)

1286
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:26,679
JERRY: Just summoning horses? KATE: (laughing) Oh my god.

1287
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:28,279
(laughter)

1288
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,340
KRIS: Into the fisher!

1289
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,600
(laughter)

1290
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,480
KATE: You know it has only been like one day and you've killed a lot of animals.

1291
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,380
JERRY/RYAN: Yeah.

1292
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,900
AMY: There have been zero animals that have died except that.

1293
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,039
JERRY: You are animal killer number one. RYAN: No. I think I killed every single squirrel--

1294
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:43,500
RYAN: that was on the wizard. AMY: Oh yeah they did turn into meat.

1295
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,280
KATE: You did kill a lot of squirrels. AMY: That was a squirrel smoothie.

1296
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,600
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: All right nevermind.

1297
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:47,400
JERRY: It was a pudding.

1298
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:54,960
Oh yeah, yeah. You can approach this, you know as you would a physical problem. If you want.

1299
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,540
RYAN: So is the rope slightly damaged or--

1300
01:00:58,539 --> 01:00:59,599
AMY: It's only slightly damaged.

1301
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,599
JERRY: Yes. AMY: There's 50 feet of it to fuck up.

1302
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,980
JERRY: Yeah there's tons.

1303
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,920
RYAN: These are floating like pontoons.

1304
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:07,119
It's like...

1305
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:10,239
Well you need an anchor point right?

1306
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:12,619
So like go here. Give the rope to Rosie.

1307
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:16,119
RYAN: Jump to the next one since you're the most agile. AMY: Oh it's like getting drunk on kayaks with friends.

1308
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:18,159
RYAN: And then yeah. And then try to pull them together.

1309
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:19,500
That's my suggestion.

1310
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,099
JERRY: This is a solid plan. Do you want to start initiating that?

1311
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,500
RYAN: Yeah. I say, there you go. KATE: I'm with you.

1312
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,179
KATE: Huh!

1313
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:27,819
JERRY: All right. So on your turn, you enunciate this.

1314
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,580
RYAN: Yeah.

1315
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:29,900
JERRY: This pontoon scenario.

1316
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:33,160
RYAN: You're going to have to adhere it to something over there, because otherwise I'll just yoink you right off.

1317
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:35,980
KATE: I'll adhere it to this guy. So it's going to be fine.

1318
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:40,019
JERRY: So Donaar you have tossed the rope to Rosie whose turn it is next.

1319
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,860
KATE: I'm going to jam my quarterstaff into the ground.

1320
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,280
Into the soft earth of the forest floor?

1321
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,720
KATE: That I'm standing on? JERRY: Into the loam?

1322
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:49,599
KATE: Yep. The loam. Right in there.

1323
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,380
And I'm going to use that as the anchor and grip onto it.

1324
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,760
And then go, giddy up cowboy.

1325
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,440
JERRY: K. So you begin to tug that closer.

1326
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,679
RYAN: Mm-hmm. JERRY: The quarterstaff holds.

1327
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,699
JERRY: You're able to draw these together.

1328
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:09,419
You're a little agitated because the seam isn't exactly right.

1329
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,720
(laughter) RYAN: Yeah. That would bug me.

1330
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:11,719
(laughter)

1331
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:13,679
JERRY: It might-- We'll see.

1332
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,000
We'll see if it's okay when your turn comes back around.

1333
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,059
Right now, it's not okay.

1334
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:20,759
Right now it's a little wrong.

1335
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,580
It's like if the fork is a little bit off from the knife.

1336
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:25,360
JERRY: You don't like it. Right? RYAN: Yeah.

1337
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,599
JERRY: That's not how you were raised.

1338
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,059
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b.

1339
01:02:28,059 --> 01:02:30,059
KRIS: The universe might not like it either. I don't know.

1340
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:31,759
JERRY: Exactly so... Rosie. RYAN: Me first.

1341
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,980
JERRY: Rosie, you held this as the anchor. Do you toss the other end...

1342
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:39,320
JERRY: Do you toss the next part of this link to K'thriss Drow'b? KATE: I believe I will.

1343
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,360
KRIS: Okay.

1344
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:45,420
I see what we're doing now and through my sobs,

1345
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,159
because I'm starting to stop screaming now, I go,

1346
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:50,119
(sobbing) It's like a tugboat. Toot toot!

1347
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:53,559
(laughter) KRIS: And then I grab that rope.

1348
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,280
And what's on my shard?

1349
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:57,900
What's on your shard?

1350
01:02:59,059 --> 01:02:59,699
Dot com.

1351
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:02,819
JERRY: What's on your shard? KRIS: Yeah. What can I anchor it to? Let me see here.

1352
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,940
KRIS: Because I'm assuming if we do them all like that...

1353
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,240
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Come up with... AMY: A rock?

1354
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,719
KRIS: Yeah if there's a rock or a tree stump or anything like that. JERRY: Come up with a plan?

1355
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:14,000
KRIS: Yeah then I want to lash it to that.

1356
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,660
Would we have enough to send it back over there?

1357
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:21,960
So with one pull, we're just knitting the whole nest.

1358
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,159
JERRY: You may have to make something. You may have to...

1359
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:29,139
KRIS: Hmm... Let me see here. JERRY: use something.

1360
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:34,519
AMY: Now would have been a really good time for something that didn't work so well last time, but we didn't rest.

1361
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,480
(whispering) It's Thornwhip.

1362
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,539
(laughter) JERRY: That is a premium whip experience.

1363
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:41,099
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Why don't you just hug your island?

1364
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:42,739
RYAN: Look nothing's bads happening right now.

1365
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:44,979
RYAN: We're just floating. Let's all just take quick naps. KRIS: What if I just float in the water? Down the stuff?

1366
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,380
AMY: Everything is creeping.

1367
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,980
KRIS: Uh no. Let's see here.

1368
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,619
AMY: Let's take a quick nap in the abyss. KRIS: Aww shoot.

1369
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:52,239
RYAN: Quick nap. KRIS: That's not the thing I was thinking of.

1370
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:53,859
KRIS: I thought...

1371
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,080
Phantasmal Force is not an actual object.

1372
01:03:57,079 --> 01:03:58,980
I cannot create a thing.

1373
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,860
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: Can you tell me...

1374
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:01,680
JERRY: Yeah.

1375
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:04,099
KRIS: Would Mending have any effect?

1376
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:05,839
KATE: Whoa... RYAN: You're forever trying to Mend.

1377
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,420
KRIS: I got to Mend.

1378
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,159
AMY: Oh my god! KRIS: It only works on objects of...

1379
01:04:11,659 --> 01:04:14,259
KRIS: like one foot-- Where the rift is a foot.

1380
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,720
Like a tear or what have you.

1381
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,039
But would it work on these facets?

1382
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:20,599
Could I do it at the center point?

1383
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,920
JERRY: Interesting... RYAN: Going to Mend reality?

1384
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,740
KRIS: Yeah. I might I have to do it six times if that's how many shards we have.

1385
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,660
KATE: I think it's officially rad.

1386
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:32,639
JERRY: I-- Yeah well it's definitely-- KRIS: Because we're talking about math now.

1387
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,960
If I can Mend those points, the rest of it would line up.

1388
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,980
AMY: A level three character using Mend to fix the fabric of reality.

1389
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,260
JERRY: Yeah. Welcome to my campaign.

1390
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,660
AMY: This is what we like to call homebrew-- (laughs)

1391
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:45,659
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter)

1392
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:46,659
JERRY: I like it. AMY: But it's good!

1393
01:04:46,659 --> 01:04:48,839
JERRY: I think there's something interesting there. KATE: Don't question it!

1394
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,380
KRIS: Okay. RYAN: Yeah. Stop trying to talk him out of it.

1395
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:51,840
AMY: Sorry! RYAN: It's a solution.

1396
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:53,099
KRIS: Ah let's see.

1397
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:54,579
RYAN: All I got is strength and rope!

1398
01:04:54,579 --> 01:04:56,739
JERRY: Yeah exactly. I am going to demand... AMY: My rope.

1399
01:04:56,739 --> 01:04:57,939
JERRY: I am going to demand...

1400
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,700
an intelligence ability--

1401
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:03,199
KRIS: That's permissible.

1402
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:10,480
JERRY: You think you can use Mending to sew up some of the physical aspects of these points.

1403
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,559
KRIS: Right. JERRY: But...

1404
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:18,460
JERRY: getting it properly dialled in is going to require an intelligence check from you.

1405
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,099
So what I'm looking for is that dice...

1406
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:23,719
plus your intelligence number that you see in the upper left hand corner.

1407
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,399
KRIS: I'm going to love to give it to you.

1408
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,340
Oh I'm going to take an advantage by the way.

1409
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,940
KATE: Oh. Don't know if you need it. KRIS: Ah... ah...

1410
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,980
KRIS: I don't know if I need it either but I did say I would take it.

1411
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:33,780
KATE: Okay.

1412
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,200
KRIS: Yeah so this is going to be an 18. JERRY: Okay.

1413
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:38,219
JERRY: Give me-- roll the other one. KRIS: Let's check it out.

1414
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,820
KRIS: No, it didn't get better. But 18 is pretty good I feel like.

1415
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,720
JERRY: So you can see up close it's almost like a...

1416
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,760
it's like a palette or a color wheel.

1417
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:57,440
You can sort of see like slight differences in the color of these points.

1418
01:05:57,659 --> 01:06:02,339
And you're trying-- use the Mending spell to sort of attach this bit of bark...

1419
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:05,120
you know, to the tree that exists in this.

1420
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,539
It's like making a really sophisticated puzzle.

1421
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:09,639
KRIS: Right. JERRY: Basically.

1422
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:16,660
And you're able to get a couple of these pieces, you feel like, in a solid place.

1423
01:06:16,659 --> 01:06:20,599
But you don't think you'd be able to pass through this door yet.

1424
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:22,559
Or you don't know what the result would be.

1425
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,599
KRIS: I see, I see.

1426
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:27,279
Uh... shoo-- let's see here.

1427
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,360
I don't know what else I got.

1428
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,440
JERRY: That's your turn. KRIS: That's my turn! I didn't get it.

1429
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,039
JERRY: Walnut. &gt;&gt; RYAN Oh! AMY: Um... okay how many--

1430
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,679
JERRY: I saw you shaking some papers. Do you have a good plan?

1431
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:40,960
AMY: How many shards do we have that are still separated? A bunch?

1432
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,300
JERRY: Right now he has attached-- you think two or three of them.

1433
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:49,099
And so we have another three over here that we can try to--

1434
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:49,980
JERRY: squish together. AMY: Incredible.

1435
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:52,320
AMY: I turn into a giant spider!

1436
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,720
Using wildshape.

1437
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:55,399
JERRY: (shouting) Are you for fucking real?

1438
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,599
AMY: An invariable rope machine. (laughs)

1439
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,900
KRIS: Yes! KATE: It's just ropes for days!

1440
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,740
KATE: It's all you are! JERRY: They have a rope gland!

1441
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:04,439
AMY: I have a special sac just for ropes.

1442
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,460
JERRY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RYAN: It's in the butt. AMY: And I would like to-- Yeah.

1443
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,960
AMY: I would like to make some of my good, good butt rope.

1444
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,699
RYAN: That's how spiders work. KRIS: It's near the butt.

1445
01:07:10,699 --> 01:07:11,919
KRIS: It's not in the butt. AMY: All right.

1446
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:14,059
AMY: Sorry we have a spider expert here. RYAN: All right Doctor "Doo-litter."

1447
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:16,079
JERRY: What you going to do with that rope?

1448
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,679
AMY: Um what am I going to do with all that rope?

1449
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,039
So I can do...

1450
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:25,739
I have a web attack so I can just shoot one of these things.

1451
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,380
KATE: Your sticky icky.

1452
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,440
AMY: You know, use my little... my little mandibles.

1453
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,280
JERRY: Your little pedipalps.

1454
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,340
AMY: My pedipalps. Sorry you know all about-- JERRY: They don't bite it!

1455
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,180
AMY: Right, right.

1456
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:35,819
JERRY: You know what I mean? KATE: Just bite it!

1457
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,100
AMY: Then I want to put it-- RYAN: Use your haunches.

1458
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:38,819
AMY: Yeah. JERRY: Here...

1459
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,620
RYAN: Put your haunches to work! AMY: Do you want me to roll--

1460
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:42,179
AMY: to see if I get these spots or something?

1461
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:43,399
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I would love that.

1462
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,460
JERRY: I want a wisdom check from you.

1463
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:47,719
AMY: You want a wisdom check from me?

1464
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:49,559
JERRY: I want a wisdom check. AMY: I'm very wizzy.

1465
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:50,759
KATE: (laughing) Very good haunch. AMY: Ooh!

1466
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,600
AMY: 21.

1467
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,339
KATE: Ooh ho ho. RYAN: Ooh.

1468
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,720
JERRY: So you see it.

1469
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:56,559
It's this circular pattern...

1470
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:03,639
basically sort of splayed out almost like a floral icon.

1471
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:04,819
AMY: Whoa. JERRY: Right?

1472
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,180
KRIS: (whispering) Or its internal web! JERRY: No, no, no.

1473
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:11,919
JERRY: And that's the thing. Your awareness as a spider, you know where the problems are.

1474
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,840
But you know where each...

1475
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,860
AMY: I can see the Matrix?

1476
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:19,159
JERRY: Exactly. Where each of these seams, you just know where it's wrong.

1477
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,659
And then she becomes bulbous for real!

1478
01:08:22,659 --> 01:08:24,420
AMY: I'm hacking the web. JERRY: Yeah exactly.

1479
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,000
JERRY: And she just skitters-- KATE: Dark web.

1480
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,020
JERRY: like effortlessly skitters around... RYAN: I get all these references.

1481
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:38,039
JERRY: And even up and around this partitioning. This shattered partition.

1482
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:40,199
And sews it all together.

1483
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,880
And then with a final tug you see everything sort of slide together.

1484
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,420
You can see thin seams...

1485
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,119
But the portal is there and ready to go.

1486
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:51,239
AMY: And unfortunately you still see a giant spider.

1487
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:53,000
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. KATE: How big are you?

1488
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:56,239
AMY: Giant spider. It's the size class large.

1489
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:58,559
JERRY: It's not a small spider. RYAN: No.

1490
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,980
KATE: I want to ride her.

1491
01:08:59,979 --> 01:09:01,759
RYAN: It's a venti. JERRY: Spider rider?

1492
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,060
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: Is it just for the pun?

1493
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,580
KATE: No! I would-- No. KRIS: This is amazing!

1494
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:08,880
AMY: If it was Rosie, yeah Walnut would allow this.

1495
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,920
KATE: Nice. Okay.

1496
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,720
AMY: As I duck down. KATE: I jump on.

1497
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,559
KATE: I'm riding a spider.

1498
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,000
KATE: Crossed it off my bucket list. AMY: Hmm.

1499
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,500
KATE: Thank you. AMY: That's fine.

1500
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,840
AMY: Remain in spider form.

1501
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,079
JERRY: I love it.

1502
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:20,920
RYAN: All right.

1503
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,539
KRIS: I'm so pleased.

1504
01:09:22,539 --> 01:09:24,119
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Great.

1505
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:28,880
JERRY: You pass through now-- This portal is not a hundred percent designed for spiders...

1506
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:30,880
JERRY: But it's fine. AMY: Okay.

1507
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:37,100
JERRY: You're able to make yourself portal compatible.

1508
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,120
AMY: Oh like I do.

1509
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:39,180
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: Where I get all...

1510
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,200
KATE: Ew. JERRY: It's like the gull wing door.

1511
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,599
JERRY: It's like right here. So legs are higher.

1512
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,340
Yeah going to high-knee it through the crack.

1513
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,779
AMY: Mm-hmm. KRIS: So you're kind of hugged in tight on the thorax--

1514
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:55,800
KRIS: by these barbed legs... KATE: And I deeply believe this is a nasty thing that I'm doing.

1515
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
JERRY: Gaff thorax. KATE: Get that thorax.

1516
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,119
JERRY: You got a grip on it.

1517
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:00,779
KATE: Yeah. Scaly.

1518
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,359
RYAN: The most necessary thing to have done.

1519
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:04,619
JERRY: You cast--

1520
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:07,979
KATE: Yeah like teabagging your friend? Is that-- RYAN: (chefs kissing sound)

1521
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:11,119
RYAN: That was to establish, you know, the pecking order. JERRY: No, teabagging them...

1522
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,819
JERRY: in an unknowable... ancient evil. KRIS: Right.

1523
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,600
JERRY: Probably never happened in a campaign before.

1524
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,180
KRIS: No. Needless. JERRY: That's the kind of material we deliver...

1525
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,440
RYAN: I got to prove I'm strong. KATE: Do that in Call of Duty all the time.

1526
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:24,460
JERRY: So you push through. RYAN: When we're voting on leader.

1527
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:27,539
JERRY: Donaar. Do you pass through this arch?

1528
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,180
RYAN: Well yeah if everyone else already has.

1529
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,700
Last. Hesitantly.

1530
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:32,880
Because of doorways and whatnot.

1531
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,279
JERRY: Yeah, K'thriss… (laughter)

1532
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:37,559
JERRY: As you pass through it you sort of wonder idly...

1533
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:42,199
what those hairline fractures in the portal might result in.

1534
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:43,539
KRIS: Hmm. AMY: Ooh.

1535
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,199
JERRY: And as you-- KATE: Oops. &gt;&gt; AMY: Cheese wire.

1536
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,420
JERRY: As you pass through...

1537
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,140
RYAN: Party wipe.

1538
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,560
JERRY: Uh party wipe.

1539
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,700
(laughter)

1540
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:51,260
As you pass through...

1541
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,020
you emerge in a place that is...

1542
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,480
profoundly abstract.

1543
01:10:57,619 --> 01:11:01,220
So you move from different versions of the same space...

1544
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,500
into a shattered version of a natural space.

1545
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:08,979
This does not have an analog with space.

1546
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,420
The realm that you have entered...

1547
01:11:13,699 --> 01:11:17,739
is defined primarily by a gray mist.

1548
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,260
You, Rosie, and you, Walnut,

1549
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:26,000
are sort of hugging--

1550
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,279
You have your legs around the edge of a staircase...

1551
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:35,279
that is slowly spinning in place.

1552
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:37,460
RYAN: This... AMY: (grunts of exertion)

1553
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,279
KRIS: It's Hogwarts. AMY: Yeah Hogwarts.

1554
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:41,559
AMY: Are you telling me Jim Darkmagic passed this--

1555
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,420
AMY: AI initiation test? KATE: No way.

1556
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,980
AMY: (laughs) &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: Hogwarts...

1557
01:11:44,979 --> 01:11:50,279
JERRY: Hogwarts is an incredible visual cue.

1558
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,440
That's exactly what we're talking about. Specifically the Gryffindor...

1559
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,400
RYAN: Okay.

1560
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:55,739
JERRY: scenario right? AMY: Staircase.

1561
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:56,899
RYAN: I get this reference.

1562
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,819
JERRY: But when each of you emerge...

1563
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,460
you are on your own versions of these...

1564
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:09,039
geometric objects. These staircases. That are in different places.

1565
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:13,159
So it's vitally important that from here on...

1566
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:16,059
that I know when your character is speaking and when you are speaking.

1567
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,480
AMY: Ooh okay. KATE: Sí.

1568
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:19,599
RYAN: So... this is... KRIS: Yuck.

1569
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,940
RYAN: Up is up and down is down, though right? This isn't like M.C. Escher...

1570
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:29,199
JERRY: As near as you can tell there is an up based on how you're standing on this.

1571
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,319
No one-- If you look around you can see your fellows,

1572
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,939
but they are not coming out of the fucking side area, if you know what I mean.

1573
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:36,559
RYAN: All right.

1574
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:38,500
RYAN: It's not like I'm standing here and you're standing there.

1575
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,300
KRIS: I'm standing there yeah.

1576
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,500
RYAN: Boo bip bip bip. JERRY: Exactly.

1577
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,920
JERRY: But this swing does require...

1578
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:47,819
some concentration to maintain your position on it.

1579
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:51,019
Obviously you got-- you are just gripped around it.

1580
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:55,300
That abdomen is just laying down on the top of this thing.

1581
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,500
KATE: Kate speaking. Not Rosie.

1582
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,600
How close do our staircases swing from each other?

1583
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,280
JERRY: They do not intersect each other's arcs.

1584
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,099
KATE: Okay. KRIS: Hmm.

1585
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:09,199
JERRY: At all. KATE: So we're orbiting very different--

1586
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,699
KATE: planets? JERRY: Yeah exactly. And there are other shapes...

1587
01:13:11,979 --> 01:13:16,319
JERRY: There are other like primitive shapes that exist in this space...

1588
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,440
KATE: Such as? JERRY: as well. Spheres...

1589
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:21,639
KATE: I like that. JERRY: Pyramid shapes.

1590
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,740
KATE: Okay.

1591
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:24,579
JERRY: Dodecahedrons. &gt;&gt; KATE: Ooh. KRIS: Toroids?

1592
01:13:24,579 --> 01:13:26,739
KATE: Wait. Do they have numbers?

1593
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:28,179
JERRY: No. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Parallelograms? (laughter)

1594
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,300
(laughter)

1595
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,180
AMY: Ah! We're in the table. No. JERRY: No, no.

1596
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,860
RYAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now you're in the deep web!

1597
01:13:33,859 --> 01:13:35,639
(laughter)

1598
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,319
KRIS: How are we like-- KATE: Whose turn is it?

1599
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,759
AMY: It's Donaar's turn. KRIS: Oh okay.

1600
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,500
RYAN: Is it?

1601
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,039
AMY: Yeah I did all-- I mean-- KRIS: Yeah. She's a spider.

1602
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:43,819
JERRY: Yeah. Walnut went. AMY: I did all my web stuff.

1603
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:44,519
KATE: Yeah she's spider.

1604
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,480
RYAN: So wait we're all on little spinny stairwells.

1605
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:49,279
RYAN: This is Ryan talking. JERRY: Revolving. Right exactly.

1606
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:50,639
RYAN: Independently. JERRY: Mm-hmm.

1607
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:53,420
JERRY: Their arcs don't converge.

1608
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:58,039
RYAN: Wait. How far apart are these? Just roughly?

1609
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,239
JERRY: Roughly probably...

1610
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:02,279
JERRY: 45 feet? RYAN: Okay.

1611
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:06,239
RYAN: So we went through this portal and all popped up in our own little stairwells.

1612
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,019
AMY/KATE: Mmm.

1613
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,040
KRIS: Do they look like they-- Oh sorry. You go ahead.

1614
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:11,920
KRIS: It's your turn now. RYAN: No. I guess I'll be like...

1615
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:15,239
Hey guys!

1616
01:14:15,979 --> 01:14:17,519
Everyone okay? Going to the top of my stairs!

1617
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,600
KRIS: So you speak. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

1618
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,760
KATE: So you speak. RYAN: Yeah.

1619
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,400
JERRY: So you say, "Hey guys. Going to the top of my stairs."

1620
01:14:23,819 --> 01:14:28,159
And there is an image at the end of your staircase...

1621
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:32,859
of you walking toward the top of the stairs.

1622
01:14:32,859 --> 01:14:33,619
RYAN: Hmm.

1623
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,840
KRIS: (laughs)

1624
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:37,340
RYAN: Hmm. JERRY: What are you delighted, Kris?

1625
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,360
KRIS: Yes! RYAN: Yeah.

1626
01:14:38,359 --> 01:14:39,219
(laughter)

1627
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,500
RYAN: Does everyone see that? Or do I just see that? JERRY: Yeah. No, you see it like it's a real thing.

1628
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,399
RYAN: Okay.

1629
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,860
(laughing) Looks I'm going to do that!

1630
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,280
And then I do it?

1631
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:51,759
KATE: Okay. Great.

1632
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,360
JERRY: So you walk up-- you follow this other version of yourself to the top of these stairs.

1633
01:14:55,539 --> 01:14:56,840
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: And then you wait.

1634
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,500
JERRY: The farther you walk up the stairs,

1635
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,779
the more stairs there seem to be at the top,

1636
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:02,399
and the fewer there are behind you.

1637
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:03,639
RYAN: Hmm. KRIS: Bleh.

1638
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,360
RYAN: I don't want to get out of eyesight of anyone.

1639
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:06,579
JERRY: That's a good plan. RYAN: Yeah.

1640
01:15:06,579 --> 01:15:09,359
JERRY: That's a good plan in a place that's completely beyond space and time.

1641
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:11,319
RYAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KATE: I'm going to whisper-- JERRY: Rosie.

1642
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:12,979
KATE: Rosie-- I'm Rosie.

1643
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:14,439
JERRY: I'm Rosie!

1644
01:15:14,439 --> 01:15:15,339
KATE: I'm-- (laughs)

1645
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,180
KRIS: I am Rosie. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Wait, I'm Rosie. KATE: But I'm the one that wrote the essay.

1646
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,260
KATE: I'm Rosie!

1647
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,800
Walnut, do you think we should just go back through the portal? This place sucks.

1648
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:25,379
JERRY: When she says the word "portal,"

1649
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:32,000
the top of your staircase flattens out, smooths out...

1650
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:34,199
and a portal appears.

1651
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,739
RYAN: Oh. KATE: Tight.

1652
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,739
KATE: (whispering) It's Scribblenauts.

1653
01:15:37,859 --> 01:15:39,079
RYAN: Oh...

1654
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:41,300
JERRY: Hold on let me take a moment to wink at the camera.

1655
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,500
(laughter) RYAN: Cheeseburger.

1656
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,840
KATE: It's not your turn. AMY: This is Amy talking,

1657
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,260
Say "more equity!" (laughs)

1658
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:49,699
(laughter)

1659
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:51,880
JERRY: Better contracts! KRIS: Yeah.

1660
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:55,280
KATE: Graduation from internship. RYAN: Yeah.

1661
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:56,899
(laughter)

1662
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:03,179
JERRY: So it's there. Previously these portals have had a dark cast. A gray cast.

1663
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,260
This is a pearlescent white portal.

1664
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,480
RYAN: Ooh. AMY: Well on my turn maybe I can do something about it.

1665
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:09,939
JERRY: Yep. K'thriss Drow'b.

1666
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:13,159
How will you enjoy your whirling staircase?

1667
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:19,400
KRIS: I don't know. This is a refreshing respite from what I was just at.

1668
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:21,039
AMY: Say "one true god" and see what happens.

1669
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:22,579
KRIS: Oh uh... AMY: I'm joking!

1670
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,500
KRIS: Back at the mouth!

1671
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,739
JERRY: (gargling noises)

1672
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:26,639
(laughter)

1673
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,760
No, it just-- (gargling noises)

1674
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,860
(laughter)

1675
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:31,099
No, no. It goes down-- (gargling noises)

1676
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,280
And when it goes up there's no more K'thriss.

1677
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:35,899
KRIS: Yeah, but it'll go-- (slurping sound). Licks its chops.

1678
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:36,639
JERRY: (gargling sound).

1679
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,079
KRIS: I did see that what just happened.

1680
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,800
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: But I didn't hear it apparently.

1681
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,000
KATE: No, I whispered. KRIS: Because you whispered,

1682
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,180
KRIS: so I'm not sure how the portal showed up.

1683
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,739
But I do say, I'm not sure how they got a portal!

1684
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:49,079
No, I don't do that.

1685
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,020
KRIS: Um... JERRY: Do you say the word "portal"?

1686
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,280
KRIS: No, I don't actually said. JERRY: Oh.

1687
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:55,199
KRIS: That's me metagaming. But it doesn't work.

1688
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,819
I'm curious though, do the stairs match up at all?

1689
01:16:57,819 --> 01:16:59,859
JERRY: Mm-mmm. KRIS: They don't look like they match? Okay.

1690
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:03,659
JERRY: No, no. They aren't a part of a single architecture or anything like that.

1691
01:17:03,939 --> 01:17:06,719
Theirs is sort of marble in nature.

1692
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,440
JERRY: Yours is rustic woods.

1693
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:09,859
KRIS: Oh! So completely different. I see.

1694
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,380
Um... Jeez!

1695
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,880
Fascinating.

1696
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:15,359
Um...

1697
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:17,379
JERRY: Listen, the main thing I need to ask--

1698
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,340
the main thing I need to make sure is that

1699
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,100
I know when K'thriss Drow'b is speaking and when Kris Straub is.

1700
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,800
KRIS: Exactly. Right, no I will proceed his words.

1701
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:28,319
Um... let me...

1702
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:34,859
I want to just do like an insight check and see if I get a sense of like...

1703
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,859
JERRY: Yeah absolutely. KRIS: just the nature of the stairs.

1704
01:17:37,859 --> 01:17:39,380
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

1705
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:43,279
Insight-- This would be-- I would say this going to be more on the arcana.

1706
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,920
KRIS: Oh, okay. That's fair.

1707
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,779
KATE: You do have Neuveunomicon.

1708
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,900
KRIS: I do...

1709
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:49,279
RYAN: Mmm. KATE: If there's a--

1710
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:51,179
KATE: Magic-8 Ball like question. JERRY: Yeah you could. &gt;&gt; AMY: Yeah!

1711
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,680
KRIS: Oh it is-- and I get a single one, right?

1712
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:58,940
JERRY: Yeah exactly. It'll be like-- I can give you-- basically a mystical Magic-8 Ball.

1713
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,539
This is a good thing or a bad thing.

1714
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,980
Weal or woe, I think is the usual way it's phrased.

1715
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,300
KRIS: Ugh.

1716
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,900
Nothing that would assist me.

1717
01:18:08,899 --> 01:18:11,920
KRIS: Because I'm like-- JERRY: Don't worry. You'll have plenty of opportunities to use it.

1718
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,420
KRIS: Yeah let me hang on to it then.

1719
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:16,000
That one's too important. So let's do again arcana.

1720
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,400
Ugh. That one is going to be a ten.

1721
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:21,319
JERRY: Ten. KRIS: Yeah.

1722
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:23,299
JERRY: This place is shapeless.

1723
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:28,960
It has ephemeral things that appear and then leave.

1724
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,199
But you saw with Donaar. Wherever he goes on this it just sort of goes with him and follows.

1725
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:35,960
You want to think about it for a little bit?

1726
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,260
KRIS: Yeah let me-- JERRY: You want to sit there and think about what you did.

1727
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,739
KRIS: Let me... JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen.

1728
01:18:38,739 --> 01:18:40,880
AMY: Wrong. JERRY: Oh yeah. Walnut.

1729
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:46,260
AMY: This will not be Walnut speaking at all because Walnut cannot speak as a spider, so...

1730
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,460
JERRY: Yeah! AMY: Getting you out of that.

1731
01:18:48,819 --> 01:18:51,880
AMY: I would-- seeing the portal...

1732
01:18:53,659 --> 01:18:55,819
Can I look at...

1733
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,300
Hmm.

1734
01:18:58,539 --> 01:19:04,159
Can I try and shoot a web onto K'thriss?

1735
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,180
And like get him?

1736
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:10,340
KRIS: Oh yeah. JERRY: What's the range on your web?

1737
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,220
AMY: (whispering) I don't know.

1738
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,640
KRIS: As much as you want. AMY: So I guess I can't do it. I don't have that written down.

1739
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:17,159
KRIS: It's a good thought though. Let me see what I could have done. AMY: Yeah...

1740
01:19:18,619 --> 01:19:19,819
AMY: Shoot. Okay.

1741
01:19:19,819 --> 01:19:21,420
RYAN: I still have the rope. I have your rope.

1742
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:23,399
AMY: Mm-hmm.

1743
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,500
So I mean we could go through the portal but it seems like...

1744
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,000
I wouldn't want to go through the portal with everybody.

1745
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:34,039
I don't want to turn out of the spider because it seems very helpful.

1746
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,240
KATE: I think Rosie has caughten on to what's going on here. So you can--

1747
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:40,479
JERRY: Yeah you can broadcast. KATE: show what you want.

1748
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:43,679
KATE: Yeah. Can I just like out-of-turn broadcast?

1749
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,740
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. If you want to you can say something. KATE: Okay.

1750
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,139
KATE: It's Scribblenauts!

1751
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,619
(laughter)

1752
01:19:48,619 --> 01:19:49,800
KRIS: (whispering) What?

1753
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,320
KATE: Say whatever you need!

1754
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,460
AMY: Oh okay. KATE: To get out of here!

1755
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:54,260
AMY: So then I'm going to turn into Walnut.

1756
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,720
KATE: Yeah you probably need to turn into Walnut.

1757
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,000
RYAN: Still on her back.

1758
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:01,199
(laughter) JERRY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Still--

1759
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,619
KATE: It's no problem! JERRY: On all fours.

1760
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,600
KATE: I weigh 29 pounds. KRIS: Yeah that's true. Yeah.

1761
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,100
AMY: Okay. No more spider.

1762
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,180
JERRY: Yeah.

1763
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,500
AMY: I'm now the dashing devil-may-care druid that you all love.

1764
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,380
And I say...

1765
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,079
We need bridges to connect all these stairs.

1766
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,199
KRIS: Hmm. JERRY: Okay.

1767
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:28,939
JERRY: As you say, "We need bridges to connect all these stairs," the staircases stop.

1768
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,000
In some configuration.

1769
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:38,439
And then you see stairways joining from tops to bottoms, and bottoms to tops.

1770
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:45,099
But the space is rapidly filling with a geometric pattern of stairways.

1771
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,079
AMY: Okay. KRIS: I see.

1772
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:47,859
KATE: Oops. KRIS: It's like the end of Interstellar.

1773
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:49,019
AMY: Whoops!

1774
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,040
AMY: Okay. JERRY: It's Interstellar Scribblenauts.

1775
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:52,899
KATE: (laughs)

1776
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:54,300
KRIS: (dinging noises) AMY: Donaar?

1777
01:20:54,819 --> 01:20:55,880
RYAN: Is it me?

1778
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:59,700
RYAN: I say... JERRY: There's a clear path, yeah.

1779
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:01,000
RYAN: How'd you get a portal?

1780
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,680
(laughter)

1781
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:06,699
And I look around.

1782
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:11,520
JERRY: You hear a sound-- almost like a sound of a xylophone.

1783
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,320
It's got a resonant ping.

1784
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:17,739
And then their portal sort of flashes inside the middle of it.

1785
01:21:18,439 --> 01:21:20,319
RYAN/KATE/KRIS: Hmm.

1786
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,720
KRIS: Oh my god.

1787
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:23,479
KATE: Got that hit marker.

1788
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:24,459
RYAN: Yeah.

1789
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,380
So when these bridges are being built,

1790
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,539
JERRY: Yeah they're still clacking together. Different materials--

1791
01:21:31,539 --> 01:21:33,079
RYAN: Are they built or are they still-- JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1792
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:38,460
JERRY: Yeah it's fast, but like I say, the place is rapidly filling up with them.

1793
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:39,260
RYAN: Okay.

1794
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:42,800
Cool it with the bridges!

1795
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,739
JERRY: It's trying to join every vertex basically. KATE: Don't say "bridge."

1796
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:47,899
KRIS: Right yeah.

1797
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:50,000
AMY: (whispering) Run. RYAN: What's the opposite of a bridge?

1798
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,779
RYAN: I just run over to their-- towards the portal.

1799
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:55,340
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You just go through it past them?

1800
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:57,099
RYAN: No, no. I don't go through the portal.

1801
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,600
I just huddle up.

1802
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,180
KRIS: I want to go through that portal. JERRY: The team-- All right.

1803
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,020
RYAN: I'm the last to go through all doors.

1804
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,000
JERRY: Rosie Beestinger.

1805
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,800
KATE: Is K'thriss set up to get to us?

1806
01:22:04,939 --> 01:22:12,519
JERRY: Yeah there is a thicket of stairways sort of growing together.

1807
01:22:12,899 --> 01:22:15,379
but there is still a path for him to get through.

1808
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:16,800
KATE: Okay. I'm going to say...

1809
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:19,380
Cup of tea. Just to try it.

1810
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,319
Cup of tea.

1811
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:24,500
JERRY: It appears. But about a foot higher than you'd like.

1812
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:25,140
KATE: Yeah.

1813
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:28,160
JERRY: And then falls but not too fast.

1814
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,239
KATE: Okay. I'm very agile, grab it.

1815
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,519
JERRY: Yeah. Oh yeah you just--

1816
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,360
KATE: (slurping sound)

1817
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:34,159
I'm very happy.

1818
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,680
AMY: That's it? KATE: That's it.

1819
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,680
AMY: Oh that's your whole action. That's really good. JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b.

1820
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:43,039
KRIS: Amazing. All right. If there is a path for me, then I would like to join these fellows.

1821
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:46,880
JERRY: Yep, yep. As you are moving across this path--

1822
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,300
I mean, the space behind you is rapidly filling up...

1823
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,020
KRIS: With stairs. JERRY: with additional stairs.

1824
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:56,840
JERRY: Of every conceivable manufacture.

1825
01:22:57,619 --> 01:22:59,119
KRIS: (whispering) Stairworld. RYAN: Yeah.

1826
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:02,340
KRIS: This could be valuable. Hang out here and just farm them.

1827
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,000
(laughter)

1828
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,659
JERRY: We defeat elite stairs.

1829
01:23:05,659 --> 01:23:06,639
KRIS: (laughing) Yeah.

1830
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:07,680
JERRY: That's the key.

1831
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,640
KRIS: Do I-- So yeah--

1832
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:13,920
As I approach them, like I have enough space to get to them before my stairs die out.

1833
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,880
JERRY: Yes. Absolutely. KRIS: Okay.

1834
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:15,920
KRIS: So I've done that...

1835
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,539
Are we all now at this--

1836
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:20,140
JERRY: You stand before a glowing portal.

1837
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:23,560
As so many Dungeons &amp; Dragons parties before you have.

1838
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,960
KRIS: Yuck. I hate these portals.

1839
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,140
AMY: I choose death! No.

1840
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:29,140
(laughter) JERRY: I just jump off. No!

1841
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:31,140
(laughter) KRIS: Yeah. Me dying.

1842
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,280
JERRY: But you'd like fall two feet. Because there'd be a set of stairs there.

1843
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:34,239
AMY: Yeah, yeah.

1844
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,680
KRIS: Uh... oh man.

1845
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:38,659
I kind of just want to go through.

1846
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:40,139
KATE: Go through it. Pop your head in. AMY: Go ahead.

1847
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,440
KRIS: I feel like maybe we go through it, guys.

1848
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:42,239
KATE: Don't be afraid.

1849
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,139
KRIS: I give you each like a look like...

1850
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:45,320
I'm just going to do it.

1851
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:48,119
All right!

1852
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:50,039
RYAN: This is Witch World, man.

1853
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:51,699
JERRY: Yeah! RYAN: I say,

1854
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:54,139
JERRY: Now you found a world-- RYAN: Gold pieces and health potions!

1855
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:55,780
(laughter) RYAN: I say that out loud.

1856
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,539
KRIS: No, thank you.

1857
01:23:57,539 --> 01:23:59,140
JERRY: It's like Vegas.

1858
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,320
RYAN: Yeah.

1859
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:03,659
JERRY: Just glinting light-- like a school of goldfish. RYAN: And I'm like...

1860
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,020
RYAN: Nice!

1861
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:09,980
JERRY: Just clinking down, like gold rolling down these infinite staircases.

1862
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:11,559
KRIS: Oh it's so noisy.

1863
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,060
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: Cacophony.

1864
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:18,560
JERRY: The sound is awful, but you hear breaking glass, you see drips running down.

1865
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,960
AMY: Oh. KATE. Look what you did.

1866
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:25,119
JERRY: The party has gathered before this portal.

1867
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,480
What's next?

1868
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,459
AMY: Go through! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. KATE: Go through the portal.

1869
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,899
RYAN: I want to take-- I want to try to get some gold.

1870
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:35,359
KATE: Oh before I go through the portal, I have a missive from Viari.

1871
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:38,299
JERRY: Oh yeah? KATE: I have to say, Jim Darkmagic.

1872
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,779
And hold him hostage until he...

1873
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,120
KATE: agrees to our demands. AMY: (laughs)

1874
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:46,560
AMY: (laughing) No. RYAN: Ah that's clever.

1875
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,480
RYAN: You say, Jim Darkmagic? AMY: Well-- let's hear that out.

1876
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:51,059
JERRY: And he materializes.

1877
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:53,160
KATE: Let's see where this goes. RYAN: That's actually really funny.

1878
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:54,779
KATE: Let's see where this goes.

1879
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:57,979
KATE: All right. Rosie, I guess, I-- AMY: You're on my back.

1880
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,580
KATE: I am on your back.

1881
01:24:59,579 --> 01:25:03,180
I remember Jim Darkmagic from the inn and for some reason I think like,

1882
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,860
he'd probably know how to help us right now.

1883
01:25:04,859 --> 01:25:07,079
So I say, Jim Darkmagic, out loud.

1884
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,300
JERRY: Jim Darkmagic? KATE: Yeah.

1885
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,659
JERRY: Okay.

1886
01:25:11,659 --> 01:25:16,220
There is a sound like a slap on a bass drum.

1887
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,140
RYAN: (laughs)

1888
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:18,320
AMY: (rimshot sounds)

1889
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:19,859
(laughter) KRIS: (bass guitar sounds) &gt;&gt; JERRY: Exactly.

1890
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,240
JERRY: And a purple-garbed wizard...

1891
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,779
is sort of descending through space.

1892
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,199
And he says,

1893
01:25:29,779 --> 01:25:30,579
What the--?

1894
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:33,200
And you see two parts of stairs...

1895
01:25:33,619 --> 01:25:35,640
grow together and liquify him.

1896
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,600
(laughter)

1897
01:25:37,619 --> 01:25:38,880
RYAN: Ah...

1898
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:40,920
KATE: Rosie says, whoops!

1899
01:25:41,739 --> 01:25:42,639
Yah!

1900
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,800
(laughter)

1901
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,300
KATE: To the portal! AMY: You jump through the portal.

1902
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,100
JERRY: You keep fucking with my game, Pat Rothfuss.

1903
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,500
You keep fucking with my game and--

1904
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,960
AMY: I loved it. RYAN: He'll kill characters!

1905
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,039
RYAN: He'll kill beloved main characters.

1906
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:54,979
JERRY: I don't even care. KRIS: Was it a purple-robed wizard?

1907
01:25:54,979 --> 01:25:59,219
KRIS: Or was it a lithe rogue with red hair?

1908
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,280
JERRY: (laughs) Sensual.

1909
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:03,659
AMY: I want to jump through this portal and I got Rosie on my back.

1910
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:04,720
JERRY: All right. Absolutely.

1911
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,360
AMY: I take her through. KRIS: Me through also, please.

1912
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:09,100
JERRY: You-- RYAN: I say, handful of gold.

1913
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,900
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: And I take it then I go.

1914
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:12,119
JERRY: Yeah and it goes-- (sputtering sound)

1915
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:13,500
RYAN: I just want to see what happens.

1916
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,439
KRIS: Nice. Nice boy.

1917
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:19,680
JERRY: As you walk through, Rosie and Walnut...

1918
01:26:21,819 --> 01:26:23,840
JERRY: You're holding on to each other physically? AMY: Mm-hmm.

1919
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,920
JERRY: You do that. You both appear...

1920
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,520
in a warm bed.

1921
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:32,359
AMY: Together? JERRY: Together.

1922
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:33,519
KRIS: Whoa. KATE: Finally.

1923
01:26:34,359 --> 01:26:35,119
RYAN: Slash fic.

1924
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:37,640
JERRY: Listen. It's what the fans want.

1925
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,700
AMY: Walnut's intimidated by her experience.

1926
01:26:39,699 --> 01:26:41,519
RYAN: Geriatric...

1927
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,740
KATE: I'm a lot-- RYAN: action.

1928
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:43,719
JERRY: Exactly.

1929
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,659
AMY/RYAN: GeriActive.

1930
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:47,439
RYAN: There's something there.

1931
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:49,179
KRIS: We'll think about it. &gt;&gt; RYAN: We'll workshop it. AMY: I definitely...

1932
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:53,360
AMY: heave a huge sigh of relief and then I look to Rosie and I go,

1933
01:26:53,619 --> 01:26:54,819
Are you all right?

1934
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:57,460
KATE: Oh yeah. Never better. JERRY: There are...

1935
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:04,600
on the bedside table there is a pot of tea and two envelopes.

1936
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,920
AMY: K. Well...

1937
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,739
I want to pour tea for Rosie--

1938
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:12,099
I don't see these two clowns?

1939
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,740
JERRY: No. KATE: Nice. &gt;&gt; AMY: Great!

1940
01:27:13,739 --> 01:27:15,619
AMY: Honestly... KATE: This is perfect.

1941
01:27:15,619 --> 01:27:16,779
KRIS: Saving the best for last.

1942
01:27:16,779 --> 01:27:18,059
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: That's what Walnut wanted all along.

1943
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,740
(laughter) JERRY: It's a huge win.

1944
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:21,079
50/50 split.

1945
01:27:21,079 --> 01:27:28,760
AMY: So I pour some tea for Rosie because she's an older woman who I obviously respect due to her years.

1946
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,659
Pour her some tea,

1947
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:33,019
make sure she's all propped up in bed okay,

1948
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:35,519
give her the tea-- I'm still in bed the whole time with her.

1949
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,380
JERRY: Oh yeah. You aren't leaving the bed. KATE: We're snuggling.

1950
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:42,940
AMY: And then decide to read my-- open my envelope?

1951
01:27:42,939 --> 01:27:44,679
JERRY: Mm-hmm. Exactly. AMY: And then I pass her hers.

1952
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,520
JERRY: Inside there is a document that says,

1953
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:55,640
Walnut Dankgrass of the Enclave Pax Anima is a member in good standing. Acquisitions Incorporated.

1954
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,039
AMY/KATE/KRIS: (gasps)

1955
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:58,760
AMY: I did it! KATE: You did it, darling.

1956
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,739
AMY: You see me talking,

1957
01:27:59,739 --> 01:28:01,359
(breathlessly) I'm in Acquisitions Inc.

1958
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,179
(laughter) AMY: It's awesome!

1959
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,560
(clapping) AMY/KATE: Yay!

1960
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,160
JERRY: You have a similar one. It says,  Rosie Beestinger, member in good standing. Acquisitions Incorporated.

1961
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,039
KATE: Yes...!

1962
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:12,359
JERRY: That is it. You're in a-- it's a darkened room.

1963
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:14,719
This is a room that's been prepared for sleep.

1964
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,900
It's simple, but homey and comfortable.

1965
01:28:17,899 --> 01:28:19,639
KATE: Let's take a long ass rest.

1966
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,780
AMY: Yes. KATE: Just a long one.

1967
01:28:20,779 --> 01:28:21,880
JERRY: The longest ass rest.

1968
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,579
KATE: (gasps) No...!

1969
01:28:23,579 --> 01:28:25,199
AMY: What? KATE: Look at you, you little dork!

1970
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,059
AMY: (laughing) This is to make it official.

1971
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,600
JERRY: Oh you're putting the pin on?

1972
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,560
RYAN: Aren't you a little worried about us? I mean--

1973
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,360
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. So as a-- AMY: Ping!

1974
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:35,239
KRIS: We're still inside that membrane. Let's discover...

1975
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:37,079
RYAN: Yeah. We're back in the mouth.

1976
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:39,619
KRIS: what's occurred. RYAN: And they're celebrating sleeping.

1977
01:28:39,619 --> 01:28:42,159
JERRY: So as you pass through...

1978
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,420
you go through this--

1979
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:47,960
I mean you're still pretty hurt, I mean you're--

1980
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,600
KRIS: I'm not well. JERRY: You're not doing well.

1981
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,260
KRIS: This whole time I've not been good, yeah. JERRY: Right?

1982
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,059
JERRY: You emerge...

1983
01:28:55,239 --> 01:28:56,579
under the covers...

1984
01:28:57,779 --> 01:29:01,179
in a soft bed filled with dry straw.

1985
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,840
JERRY: Straub. KRIS: Straub now.

1986
01:29:03,899 --> 01:29:05,879
AMY: Dry Straub. JERRY: K'thriss Straw'b.

1987
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:06,920
KRIS: Straw'gob. AMY: I wet the bed.

1988
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,739
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Yeah! I pee! I pee!

1989
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:10,739
KRIS: As a bonus action.

1990
01:29:10,739 --> 01:29:16,519
JERRY: Your bedside table has an empty wineglass, and a bottle of dark wine, and an envelope.

1991
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,940
KRIS: Oh I... KATE: Got the hard shit.

1992
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:22,239
KRIS: I throw the sheets off.

1993
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:26,000
Afraid to like-- I look-- I check the envelope to see if it's roiling with teeth.

1994
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,800
(laughter) JERRY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: All right.

1995
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,579
JERRY: There are so few teeth.

1996
01:29:29,579 --> 01:29:30,399
KRIS: (sighs)

1997
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:31,460
RYAN: Like three.

1998
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,899
JERRY: Like-- Max! Top!

1999
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:35,380
KRIS: The usual number.

2000
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,260
JERRY: Three writhing saw teeth.

2001
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,880
JERRY: For an envelope. KRIS: Well I'm very careful with it.

2002
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,420
RYAN: Way less than what you were dealing with. JERRY: Exactly.

2003
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:43,940
AMY: Howler. KRIS: Yeah, distrustingly I open the envelope.

2004
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:45,500
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b.

2005
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:48,939
Member in good standing. Acquisitions Incorporated.

2006
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,619
KATE: Yes! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Whew. JERRY: 25% share.

2007
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:51,720
KRIS: (whispering) What a relief.

2008
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:54,460
JERRY: As you emerge through,

2009
01:29:54,859 --> 01:29:57,139
you appear in a bed,

2010
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,300
with the covers up,

2011
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,720
and then almost immediately the bed shatters from the middle.

2012
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:03,520
RYAN: Yeah.

2013
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:05,000
Where's my gold?

2014
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,079
JERRY: Just goes-- Your hand is empty.

2015
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:08,960
RYAN: D'oh! (laughter)

2016
01:30:09,739 --> 01:30:11,579
JERRY: Basically it...

2017
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:16,199
Like a trap-- like a bear trap, the bed just goes-- (impact sound)

2018
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,680
Like this.

2019
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,079
KRIS: Like two Murphy beds. RYAN: Yeah.

2020
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,619
KRIS: Just claps shut.

2021
01:30:21,619 --> 01:30:23,019
JERRY: It's not a mimic.

2022
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,720
JERRY: But it is-- RYAN: I'm going to freak out, wha--!

2023
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,539
KATE: There's a close-up. And like, why me?

2024
01:30:26,539 --> 01:30:28,319
RYAN: I know. Wah wah!

2025
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,760
JERRY: Zooms right in. RYAN: Too big and strong I guess.

2026
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,100
AMY: What kind of drinks does he have?

2027
01:30:33,739 --> 01:30:37,019
KRIS: Ooh. JERRY: Well he's going to have to escape this bed!

2028
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,680
RYAN: Oh. (laughing) Okay.

2029
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,180
RYAN: Do I have to roll to escape the bed? JERRY: No.

2030
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:40,940
(laughter)

2031
01:30:40,979 --> 01:30:42,119
I pull out my sword...

2032
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:43,840
JERRY: (grunts of exertion)

2033
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,819
RYAN: Just start hacking at it and I sleep on the pile of whatever it is.

2034
01:30:46,819 --> 01:30:48,299
KRIS: The lumber? RYAN: Yeah.

2035
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,520
RYAN: Lumber support? KATE: Loudly to no one,

2036
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,340
KATE: I prefer a pile anyway. JERRY: Yeah exactly.

2037
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:56,239
JERRY: In the corner. You just push all the pieces to-- RYAN: Yeah.

2038
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:58,340
RYAN: I don't trust any furniture after all this.

2039
01:30:58,340 --> 01:30:59,380
(laughter)

2040
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:05,819
JERRY: You reach up. There is a bottle of Jinaari silver wine which is a vintage--

2041
01:31:05,819 --> 01:31:07,259
RYAN: Hmm. (chef's kiss sound) JERRY: from your...

2042
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:07,940
KATE: Jeez.

2043
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:12,559
JERRY: your city. Your eastern-- in the eastern peaks of the Sword Mountains.

2044
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:18,820
Thoughtful. Tasteful. There's an envelope sort of resting against the front of the bottle.

2045
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:21,500
RYAN: All right. I drink the bottle.

2046
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,159
JERRY: Wandering around, looking out the window. KATE: You're not going to get those notes or anything?

2047
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:26,819
RYAN: Yeah I look around...

2048
01:31:26,979 --> 01:31:27,819
Take a nap.

2049
01:31:27,819 --> 01:31:29,059
(laughter)

2050
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,120
RYAN: Then I read the-- (laughs)

2051
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:31,199
(laughter)

2052
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,539
JERRY: You wake up in the morning to read it?

2053
01:31:32,539 --> 01:31:34,819
RYAN: Yeah I wake it up. I fully rest in case in case it attacks me.

2054
01:31:34,819 --> 01:31:35,659
KRIS: All right. Good. (laughter)

2055
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:36,519
(laughter)

2056
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,480
KRIS: I will deal with this in the AM. RYAN: Yep. Yeah.

2057
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:40,539
RYAN: I had a long couple of days.

2058
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:42,439
KATE: See I love what you're doing. You're like, nope!

2059
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:43,960
(laughter) JERRY: Later.

2060
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:47,540
It says, Donaar of the noble house Blit'zen.

2061
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,539
Member in good standing. Acquisitions Incorporated.

2062
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:53,939
(clapping) RYAN: I was waiting for this to curveball here.

2063
01:31:53,939 --> 01:31:55,299
AMY: Member in questionable standing. RYAN: You're like, goddamn it.

2064
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:58,279
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Some kind of dragon person.

2065
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,800
JERRY: It's weird. RYAN: It's the tea-dipping thing, right?

2066
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,279
JERRY: That's where you fucked up. RYAN: I'm sorry! Yeah.

2067
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,300
JERRY: But yeah, simple rooms...

2068
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:13,160
You know. Not-- Comfortable, but nothing out of the ordinary.

2069
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:15,960
AMY: It's a bed. It's more comfortable than whatever the hell you came out of.

2070
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,539
RYAN: So I'm like in a room by myself?

2071
01:32:17,539 --> 01:32:19,819
JERRY: You are in a room by yourself. It has two doors.

2072
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:21,259
KRIS: Shh.

2073
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,500
RYAN: And I go...

2074
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,680
(shouting) Where-- Hey where are you guys? Anyone hear me?

2075
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,140
I say, what the what? Really loud.

2076
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:33,760
JERRY: It is entirely possible to hear the sound of Donaar Blit'zen

2077
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:39,800
talking to himself and someone else, he hopes, in a nearby adjoining room.

2078
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,500
AMY: I offer Rosie more tea.

2079
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,619
KATE: I turn to Walnut and say,

2080
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:45,599
Man I'd love to not hear that guy's voice for like-- (laughing) five seconds.

2081
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,120
(laughter) AMY: And how.

2082
01:32:48,199 --> 01:32:50,880
RYAN: I start thrashing against the walls with my sword.

2083
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,940
Another trap. I'll save everyone!

2084
01:32:52,939 --> 01:32:54,159
(laughter)

2085
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:55,859
KRIS: Yeah I hear you and I say,

2086
01:32:55,859 --> 01:32:57,059
Yep! Got to go to sleep.

2087
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:59,480
Got to-- Still hurt. Got to go to sleep.

2088
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:00,919
Time to sleep.

2089
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:08,760
RYAN: I like how like I was the fool for just grabbing a door to open it and everyone's like,

2090
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,180
That's crazy! Why would you do that?

2091
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:11,659
And everyone just immediately says,

2092
01:33:11,659 --> 01:33:14,859
Oh beds in a confined space! This is all fine and normal!

2093
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:17,460
Now I'm on edge now forever!

2094
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,619
KATE: (laughing) You got some trust issues, yeah.

2095
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:19,659
RYAN: Yeah I do!

2096
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:23,159
JERRY: Trust issues, but like for plants, food...

2097
01:33:23,159 --> 01:33:24,579
KRIS/JERRY: Doors.

2098
01:33:24,579 --> 01:33:25,680
KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: Definitely doors.

2099
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,760
AMY: I want to-- JERRY: Door marriage!

2100
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,619
AMY: Do we feel rested or no?

2101
01:33:28,619 --> 01:33:30,559
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. After you wake up? AMY: Yeah.

2102
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:32,000
AMY: Do we feel-- Is it?

2103
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,260
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You have actually slept.

2104
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:36,960
For real.

2105
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:37,779
AMY: Okay.

2106
01:33:37,899 --> 01:33:39,000
JERRY: For a night.

2107
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:39,880
KATE: Nice. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Fantastic.

2108
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,279
KATE: Get those hit points back! KRIS: For four years.

2109
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:42,659
AMY: Change my spell loadout.

2110
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,500
KATE: Yeah! Long rest. KRIS: Yeah. Get rid of this.

2111
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,180
KATE: Ooh ki points. Get refreshed. JERRY: Spell loadout. You get your shit back.

2112
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:50,020
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b. Your big guns. KRIS: Please do.

2113
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:55,340
AMY: All right I want to say that I pocket the envelope somewhere safe.

2114
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,340
Put it somewhere on my person.

2115
01:33:58,539 --> 01:34:00,779
JERRY: It's on your person at all times?

2116
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:03,819
AMY: At all times. I'm putting it on my character sheet. JERRY: Okay. There we go.

2117
01:34:04,119 --> 01:34:06,220
JERRY: Some interior pocket of your--

2118
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,840
AMY: When we stop somewhere I'll have it framed.

2119
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:08,720
JERRY: of your drui-- (laughs).

2120
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:14,440
Exactly. But as I said, your rooms have two doors apiece.

2121
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:18,680
They have a larger door that you remember from having--

2122
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:23,840
You've seen doors like this very often for what seems like a week.

2123
01:34:25,079 --> 01:34:30,159
And a smaller, more simple door on an interior wall of your rooms.

2124
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:31,880
RYAN: I'm walking around door.

2125
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,840
AMY: I want to go try the tiny door.

2126
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,079
JERRY: Yeah. The tiny door opens up into a room not much bigger than, maybe like,

2127
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:40,559
four small closets put together.

2128
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:43,599
There's a tiny table in the middle with a candle.

2129
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:47,720
And a bookshelf sort of against the far wall.

2130
01:34:48,939 --> 01:34:53,319
And there are four doors leading into this room. Four small doors.

2131
01:34:53,319 --> 01:34:55,239
AMY: Dude, is this our base? And I go,

2132
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:57,460
Uh... Big guy?

2133
01:34:58,079 --> 01:34:59,039
You in here?

2134
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:01,260
RYAN: (laughs) I hear that, I assume? JERRY: Oh yeah.

2135
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:02,480
RYAN: I go, yeah.

2136
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:04,239
JERRY: The second you fall asleep.

2137
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,500
RYAN: Yeah. (laughter)

2138
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,979
RYAN: You gain one hit point back.

2139
01:35:07,579 --> 01:35:09,479
JERRY: You've been awa-- RYAN: I thought I was sleeping!

2140
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:11,079
(laughter)

2141
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:12,939
RYAN: Other guy said we were sleeping.

2142
01:35:12,939 --> 01:35:14,659
Still not catch his name, by the way.

2143
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:19,619
KRIS: Okay I'm sleeping now. I'm not talking. Actually I am asleep. No? Okay. We're--

2144
01:35:19,619 --> 01:35:21,720
AMY: No, we're all rested. We're good. KRIS: We've rested. &gt;&gt; RYAN: All right, yeah.

2145
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,440
KATE: I'd like to try the other door that Walnut did not try.

2146
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:29,739
JERRY: That door opens into a-- sort of an upper-tier...

2147
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:36,979
of a homey inn-- of the type that you have seen many times before.

2148
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:41,979
But there's no ear pressure, there's no rush of cold...

2149
01:35:41,979 --> 01:35:42,739
KATE: Thank god.

2150
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:49,079
JERRY: And it's different in a few key ways from the inn that you recall initially.

2151
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:51,899
This is not a Jim Darkmagic-themed restaurant.

2152
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:53,140
AMY: That's great.

2153
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,199
KATE: I don't want to think about Jim Darkmagic right now.

2154
01:35:56,199 --> 01:35:57,880
RYAN: Yeah. The guy you killed?

2155
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:03,960
JERRY: People are dressed in simple, comfortable attire.

2156
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:07,399
I mean when you entered into Red Larch you got a sense of the--

2157
01:36:07,399 --> 01:36:12,719
of where this town was at in the grand, you know, economic hierarchy.

2158
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:13,840
It's not up here.

2159
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:19,199
It's a town that does well because it's on the Long Road but, you know, this is a simple town.

2160
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:25,020
Over the fireplace, where there was a portrait of Jim Darkmagic,

2161
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:28,120
you actually see a picture instead of three children.

2162
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:37,699
You see what looks to be an older girl with her hands on a boy, with a striking resemblance to her,

2163
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:40,359
and then another girl on her left.

2164
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:44,520
JERRY: So-- AMY: Wait. There's two girls and one boy?

2165
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,060
JERRY: There's two girls and one boy. AMY: Okay.

2166
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:47,920
JERRY: So there is...

2167
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:53,380
It's like a nice version of the place you have spent an eternity in.

2168
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,279
The cauldron chairs are there.

2169
01:36:55,279 --> 01:36:58,479
KRIS: Oh! (shudders) JERRY: Warmed by that central fire.

2170
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:04,520
JERRY: There is a bare stool on a small stage that adjoins the fireplace.

2171
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,820
There's no one currently seated at it.

2172
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:15,340
KATE: Well I think I should-- I'm going to grunt in satisfaction. Hmm!

2173
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:20,260
And throw open the doors that I believe belong to my companions.

2174
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:25,280
JERRY: Yeah you see other rooms similar to yours.

2175
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,560
With people in various states of repose.

2176
01:37:31,039 --> 01:37:32,939
KRIS: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! RYAN: No, whoa!

2177
01:37:32,939 --> 01:37:34,219
KRIS: Okay, okay.

2178
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,579
Let me get my cloak on.

2179
01:37:35,579 --> 01:37:39,880
JERRY: So the central room that adjoins these is comically small. Like--

2180
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,580
KATE: Like halfling small or-- JERRY: it's hilariously--

2181
01:37:42,579 --> 01:37:43,640
KATE: something smaller? Okay. JERRY: Not for you.

2182
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,660
JERRY: For you this is decent.

2183
01:37:46,659 --> 01:37:50,139
The problem is that you hang around with a lot of larger people.

2184
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:55,039
This would be a family reunion. Like you would rent a place like this for events.

2185
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:59,820
JERRY: For Donaar, it's hilarious. KATE: Got it.

2186
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:01,799
RYAN: He's like, uh.

2187
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:09,159
JERRY: He has to like brush the candelabra away and then invariably it swings back. I mean it's...

2188
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,780
JERRY: It's complex. KATE: What kind of booze you seeing there?

2189
01:38:11,779 --> 01:38:13,659
JERRY: It's complex. AMY: I was going to say, is he drinking like...

2190
01:38:13,659 --> 01:38:19,000
KATE: yeah do you have-- because Walnut got tea and I bunked down with her so I got her drink.

2191
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,539
But maybe... AcqInc knows my brand.

2192
01:38:21,539 --> 01:38:23,859
What kind of drinks do you see in there?

2193
01:38:24,359 --> 01:38:26,420
RYAN: Oh in my room? KATE: In my tiny room.

2194
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:29,440
RYAN: Oh. Wait in the small chamber room?

2195
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:31,239
KATE: Uh huh. RYAN: Oh I thought I was still in my bedroom.

2196
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,779
AMY: I'm in there. RYAN: She's in there.

2197
01:38:32,779 --> 01:38:34,739
KATE: All right. Whoever's in there. Find the booze.

2198
01:38:34,739 --> 01:38:36,500
(laughter) KRIS: Just get it to me.

2199
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,899
KATE: Tiny, tiny halfling booze.

2200
01:38:37,899 --> 01:38:39,960
AMY: I go, I don't know if we should be drinking right now.

2201
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,600
KATE: (laughs) So disappointed.

2202
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,860
RYAN: Should we do the-- Is now do we do the formal introductions?

2203
01:38:44,859 --> 01:38:46,219
KATE: Yeah I open the door-- JERRY: yeah, yeah.

2204
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:49,960
JERRY: In your batcave scenario. KATE: Yeah.

2205
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:52,460
KATE: I'm going to plant my quarterstaff and say, I'm Rosie.

2206
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,060
RYAN: Okay.

2207
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,720
Then I guess I groggily get dressed. (laughs)

2208
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,039
KATE: Like fine.

2209
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,539
KRIOS: Laboriously.

2210
01:38:59,539 --> 01:39:01,119
RYAN: Yeah like ah... KRIS: You make us watch.

2211
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,599
RYAN: Put all my plate armor on.

2212
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,900
RYAN: I don't like anything about this place.

2213
01:39:03,899 --> 01:39:05,899
KATE: It takes 25 minutes. AMY: Shining each scale.

2214
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:08,439
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Individual scale polish.

2215
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:09,159
RYAN: Yeah.

2216
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,659
JERRY: Toothbrush? RYAN: I do the nails up.

2217
01:39:10,659 --> 01:39:11,859
RYAN: Oh yeah I brush the teeth for sure.

2218
01:39:11,859 --> 01:39:14,199
KATE: I'm clos-- I'm clearing my throat. I'm like, ahem. I'm Rosie.

2219
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:16,119
KRIS: While you're doing that--

2220
01:39:16,119 --> 01:39:17,939
RYAN: There's other people that can go before me.

2221
01:39:17,939 --> 01:39:21,039
KRIS: I was going to say, while you do that I say, I'm K'thriss-- But and you go,

2222
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,220
Eh no! It's my turn.

2223
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:23,659
(laughter)

2224
01:39:23,659 --> 01:39:24,619
RYAN: Bup, bup, bup!

2225
01:39:24,619 --> 01:39:26,039
(brushing teeth noises)

2226
01:39:27,619 --> 01:39:28,800
Rinse it out with wine. (spitting sound)

2227
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:31,560
JERRY: It's a bottle of Jack.

2228
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,860
RYAN: And I say, okay you can go.

2229
01:39:32,859 --> 01:39:34,599
(laughter) And I don't introduce myself.

2230
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,880
KRIS: It's not even done, yeah.

2231
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:38,980
I'm K'thriss Drow'b, partners.

2232
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,659
RYAN: Yeah. I show everyone the letter. I say,

2233
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:45,300
I guess we're all partners. I'm Donaar, by the way.

2234
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,300
The leader.

2235
01:39:47,579 --> 01:39:48,960
(laughter) And I guess we're all partners.

2236
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,960
KRIS: That's what it says on mine. Fold it up--

2237
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,100
KRIS: and never see it again. RYAN: Yeah, mine says I'm the leader. Did you guys' say that.

2238
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:56,340
RYAN: I guess not. It makes sense because I'm the dragon and you guys aren't.

2239
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,539
KATE: (laughs)

2240
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:00,740
RYAN: So, what's good?

2241
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:04,979
AMY: Oh. I very begrudgingly at this point say that I'm Walnut.

2242
01:40:05,659 --> 01:40:07,019
KATE: Like the nut? RYAN: Sulking.

2243
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:09,260
AMY: No, like I don't want to say it.

2244
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:11,140
KATE: Mm-hmm. AMY: Like, (grunt) yeah.

2245
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,860
KRIS: Oh. RYAN: Walnut. That's a good name.

2246
01:40:13,859 --> 01:40:15,099
RYAN: Like the nut?

2247
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,920
AMY: The very same.

2248
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:18,899
KATE: Like the nut. RYAN: That makes sense.

2249
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:20,140
AMY: Sure.

2250
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:22,860
KRIS: I've-- I've had some of those before. RYAN: Yeah I had those. Those are good!

2251
01:40:22,859 --> 01:40:24,279
KRIS: That's a darn good nut. RYAN: Those are good.

2252
01:40:24,279 --> 01:40:26,059
KATE: I like to put them in my zucchini bread.

2253
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:27,800
AMY: All right you don't need to make me feel good. I know.

2254
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,260
(laughter)

2255
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:30,560
With name like Walnut, you know.

2256
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:32,260
KATE: I've heard it all before.

2257
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,300
JERRY: You done heard it. AMY: Not my first time.

2258
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:40,300
JERRY: But like I say, there's enough room for each of you to stand around this small table.

2259
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:42,379
Right now the shelf is bare.

2260
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,659
Who knows what your adventures will stock it with.

2261
01:40:46,899 --> 01:40:49,839
In the middle of the room is a small round table.

2262
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:59,380
AMY: Now this is a far cry from other bases that I know that people from-- (laughing) this brand has though.

2263
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:01,500
Just want to-- Looking around like, hmm.

2264
01:41:02,199 --> 01:41:02,899
K.

2265
01:41:02,899 --> 01:41:05,599
KATE: Okay. So we each have our own rooms. JERRY: Mm-hmm.

2266
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,260
KATE: We have a downstairs where there are presumably drinking and making merry.

2267
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:14,260
JERRY: Yeah it is by all accounts a roadside inn.

2268
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,039
KATE: Okay.

2269
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:19,260
Let's go find our person, I assume.

2270
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,060
RYAN: Do we report to anyone? Yeah.

2271
01:41:21,619 --> 01:41:23,599
KATE: Omin? Probably is around here somewhere, right?

2272
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,620
This is the Dran &amp; Courtier after all.

2273
01:41:25,619 --> 01:41:28,420
RYAN: Oh wait, I mean you guys report to me. Is what I meant to say.

2274
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:29,380
AMY: No, no, no.

2275
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:30,340
Do you think that...

2276
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:32,620
Mr. Dran would be here?

2277
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,720
KATE: Oh I think there's a chance. Certainly.

2278
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:37,800
KRIS: At least there's an envoy or somebody. KATE: Stranger things have happened, my dear.

2279
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,680
(laughter)

2280
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,539
AMY: Well let's go meet him.

2281
01:41:41,539 --> 01:41:43,819
KATE: Indeed. I hop on your back again.

2282
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,120
AMY: I go, I guess this is happening.

2283
01:41:47,159 --> 01:41:49,460
RYAN: I say, this is really cramped in here. I don't know about you guys.

2284
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:54,359
KRIS: Let's go find out-- let's go verify that all of that was the test.

2285
01:41:54,920 --> 01:42:00,100
Hopefully that was all-- 100% start to finish was it actually.

2286
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:03,220
RYAN: I'm with you man. I don't trust any of this. KATE: The test is over. And there's no more test.

2287
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:05,020
RYAN: I have a lot of bad memories in this room.

2288
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,119
AMY: Yeah... I mean did reality... RYAN: In the big room.

2289
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:11,420
AMY: shatter for everybody that takes that test?

2290
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,860
KRIS: I don't... know. KATE: Let's go find out.

2291
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:15,380
KATE: Let's go downstairs and find out. AMY: Okay. Let's go downstairs.

2292
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:18,000
KRIS: We all go downstairs. Except for you who's barking at us like,

2293
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,300
I'm the man! I'm the one who gets to--

2294
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,659
RYAN: I didn't dismiss the meeting.

2295
01:42:21,659 --> 01:42:23,199
(laughter)

2296
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,659
AMY: I'm still holding the talking stick. JERRY: Who's taking minutes?

2297
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:26,300
RYAN: Yeah. Who's taking the minutes?

2298
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:31,560
JERRY: Absolutely. So you exit your rooms.

2299
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,820
Groggily. You can see a few other doors up here.

2300
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:36,659
RYAN: (shuddering sound) JERRY: Four additional rooms.

2301
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:40,039
Yours are the-- No don't worry. It's okay.

2302
01:42:40,039 --> 01:42:41,539
KRIS: Did you shudder out of fear? Or delight?

2303
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:44,720
JERRY: Yours are the middle four. RYAN: First one then the other.

2304
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:48,300
JERRY: But there's several additional rooms on each side for other guests.

2305
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,279
You head down the staircase.

2306
01:42:50,279 --> 01:42:54,619
It's a little strange because all the first times you encountered these things,

2307
01:42:54,619 --> 01:42:57,479
in shape if not in the reality,

2308
01:42:57,479 --> 01:43:01,000
all have bizarre memories associated with them.

2309
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,859
This landing, you did battle with and made love to a door.

2310
01:43:04,859 --> 01:43:05,759
RYAN: Mmm. AMY: Mm-hmm.

2311
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:06,820
RYAN: And murdered a wizard.

2312
01:43:06,819 --> 01:43:09,439
JERRY: There was a wizard, obviously. RYAN: And a bunch of squirrels.

2313
01:43:09,619 --> 01:43:11,619
KATE: (laughing) The tears and vomit.

2314
01:43:11,619 --> 01:43:15,800
JERRY: Yeah exactly. The staircase was dangerous. You saw these things over here.

2315
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:25,319
You have a vague memory of having to get all the way from the bar to the door at a completely different scale.

2316
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:30,980
But this homey inn melts a lot of that away.

2317
01:43:31,159 --> 01:43:39,619
It's not-- you can tell that it's nothing like the weird reflections that were summoned up for this test.

2318
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:42,579
AMY: So I don't see a cat anywhere? RYAN: I was going to say, look for Onyx.

2319
01:43:42,579 --> 01:43:43,720
JERRY: Do you look for a cat?

2320
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:44,920
AMY: I would like to look for a cat.

2321
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:45,920
JERRY: There is a cat.

2322
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,920
AMY: Is it Onyx?

2323
01:43:47,819 --> 01:43:50,439
JERRY: Do you want to go examine this cat? RYAN: (laughs)

2324
01:43:50,739 --> 01:43:51,779
AMY: Sorry, buddy.

2325
01:43:51,779 --> 01:43:54,259
AMY: Yes! I would like the examine the cat! RYAN: Do whatever. Go talk to him.

2326
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,079
AMY: Perception! AMY: That's what got us into this mess!

2327
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:58,100
AMY: Dang! Ten. (laughter)

2328
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:03,200
JERRY: As you round the stair at the base and move in,

2329
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:09,059
you can see behind the bar a woman of about 6'4".

2330
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:10,000
AMY: Mm-hmm.

2331
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,659
JERRY: Clean but obviously well-used plate.

2332
01:44:17,659 --> 01:44:18,859
Cleaning a glass.

2333
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:22,859
She gives you a nod as you round the corner but you're looking elsewhere.

2334
01:44:22,859 --> 01:44:23,699
AMY: Oh okay.

2335
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:32,920
JERRY: You can see a cat sort of lacing its way through people's legs and chair legs.

2336
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:40,179
As it moves out to where you can see it as it emerges from one of these little meshes,

2337
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:44,159
you think that this is probably Onyx. And in fact when Onyx sees you....

2338
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,940
she...

2339
01:44:49,539 --> 01:44:51,239
approaches your leg...

2340
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,680
and then...

2341
01:44:54,039 --> 01:44:56,100
does that cat cheek thing...

2342
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,180
AMY: Oh the--

2343
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:58,060
KATE: The good stuff.

2344
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:00,760
JERRY: on both sides of the boot.

2345
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,840
KRIS: Oh yeah. Getting that musk on.

2346
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,079
RYAN: Different than last time.

2347
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:09,840
AMY: I definitely pet Onyx although I will choose not to speak with her at this time.

2348
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,180
(laughs)

2349
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,280
AMY: Can't ask for a favor if I can't talk to her.

2350
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:15,699
JERRY: Exactly. Yeah, yeah, exact-- (laughter)

2351
01:45:15,699 --> 01:45:18,159
KRIS: Yeah. Price is high, my friend.

2352
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:21,000
AMY: But now that I know she'll be lurking around our base. RYAN: Yeah. Kill everyone in this room.

2353
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,880
JERRY: Have you ever seen-- AMY: Probably.

2354
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:26,199
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Have you ever played with a cat--

2355
01:45:26,199 --> 01:45:29,359
Or have you seen a cat that can see a bird outside of a window?

2356
01:45:29,359 --> 01:45:30,759
AMY: Yeah and they do that noise?

2357
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,180
JERRY: That chitter. &gt;&gt; KRIS: (chittering sounds) AMY: Yeah.

2358
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:34,159
JERRY: After the rub it's the chitter.

2359
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,460
KATE: Oh! AMY: Great.

2360
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,800
AMY: So I use (laughing) Speak with Animals.

2361
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:40,140
KATE: Uh oh. AMY: So I use-- I cast Speak with Animals.

2362
01:45:40,739 --> 01:45:42,960
And I see Onyx and I go,

2363
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:43,899
Hello, friend.

2364
01:45:43,899 --> 01:45:48,539
And I kneel down and put my hand out like I'm going to pet her, you know, more.

2365
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:50,680
JERRY: She withdraws a little bit.

2366
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:53,960
AMY: I go, what troubles you, friend?

2367
01:45:55,859 --> 01:45:57,079
JERRY: "Bring me a chicken."

2368
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:58,300
KRIS: (laughs)

2369
01:45:58,300 --> 01:45:59,340
AMY: A chicken...

2370
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:01,079
KRIS: The price has gone up. RTYAN: Yeah.

2371
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:03,420
RYAN: It's bigger than a mouse. AMY: I... I...

2372
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:07,159
AMY: look up at the-- am I close to the bartender?

2373
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:09,720
JERRY: "Not as your kind eats."

2374
01:46:09,899 --> 01:46:10,719
AMY: Oh.

2375
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,180
KRIS: (whispering) Ah...

2376
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,720
AMY: You want...

2377
01:46:14,699 --> 01:46:16,000
a chicken.

2378
01:46:16,819 --> 01:46:18,179
A whole chicken?

2379
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,100
JERRY: Just cocks its head.

2380
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,880
KRIS: What other kind is there?

2381
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,900
JERRY: It doesn't have a concept of a partial chicken.

2382
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:27,000
AMY: (laughs) It wants a chicken.

2383
01:46:27,399 --> 01:46:28,460
Okay.

2384
01:46:28,659 --> 01:46:29,859
Okay. I'll--

2385
01:46:29,859 --> 01:46:30,759
Okay.

2386
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,260
JERRY: "You will do as you promised."

2387
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:33,279
AMY: Okay.

2388
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,739
AMY: I do owe you-- I do owe you a chicken.

2389
01:46:35,739 --> 01:46:37,939
Okay. I will be back with a chicken.

2390
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:41,440
Then I walk away from Onyx then I look at these guys and I go,

2391
01:46:42,199 --> 01:46:46,179
I got to be honest, I thought it was going to be a much bigger ask.

2392
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:47,560
(laughter)

2393
01:46:49,659 --> 01:46:50,500
So...

2394
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:54,760
I have to get a chicken for this cat.

2395
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,360
RYAN: You're going to kill a chicken?

2396
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,460
AMY: No! I'm going to give it the chicken.

2397
01:46:58,460 --> 01:46:59,579
KATE: Like-- KATE/RYAN: A live chicken?"

2398
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:01,720
KRIS: Sure then they can eat-- AMY: Cats eat chickens.

2399
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,340
KRIS: Yeah.

2400
01:47:02,779 --> 01:47:04,019
AMY: It's fine. RYAN: Cats eat mice!

2401
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:06,380
KRIS: But an old person at the table besides you says,

2402
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:08,560
(old person voice) But chickens are forbidden in Red Larch!

2403
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,140
(laughter)

2404
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:11,740
RYAN: (old person voice) Next will be dancing!

2405
01:47:11,739 --> 01:47:15,199
AMY: We haven't had a chicken in 50 years! KRIS: What is a chicken?

2406
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:16,600
KRIS: Not in this realm.

2407
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,120
(laughter)

2408
01:47:18,119 --> 01:47:20,539
AMY: And I use Plane Shift! No, I'm joking.

2409
01:47:20,539 --> 01:47:23,500
RYAN: We broke reality and made chickens nonexistent.

2410
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,720
JERRY: Yeah it's like everywhere you're going it's like,

2411
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,159
Chickens, right? Like bawk bawk!

2412
01:47:27,159 --> 01:47:29,099
KRIS: You're like, the beat! RYAN: What? &gt;&gt; AMY: No.

2413
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:32,059
AMY: Oh you mean the cockatrice that lives in the woods.

2414
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:37,480
AMY: No. We didn't meet a chicken. I didn't make a promise to a chicken.

2415
01:47:37,479 --> 01:47:40,859
I can provide a chicken to an animal that eats chicken. Yeah, that's fine.

2416
01:47:40,859 --> 01:47:42,519
KRIS: Yeah. Yeah.

2417
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:43,980
AMY: I'm not a vegan. KRIS: Idiot.

2418
01:47:43,979 --> 01:47:46,599
KATE: Did she say that she wanted it for eating? RYAN: Feel like you play fast and loose with these rules.

2419
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:48,460
KRIS: Say what? KRIS: Did she want it for eating?

2420
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:51,260
AMY: I look at Onyx and-- because I can still talk to her, and I go,

2421
01:47:51,659 --> 01:47:55,779
Friend, I assume you want this chicken alive?

2422
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,939
JERRY: "No. For marriage."

2423
01:47:58,939 --> 01:48:00,119
(laughs)

2424
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:04,199
KATE: Okay, now is the cat being sarcastic?

2425
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:05,880
AMY: Walnut keeps it together!

2426
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,359
(laughing) Walnut keeps it together!

2427
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:08,620
She goes,

2428
01:48:08,979 --> 01:48:11,799
AMY: Ah-- JERRY: "Yes, I want to live with this chicken."

2429
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:13,980
JERRY: "And be as one."

2430
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:16,300
(laughter)

2431
01:48:16,819 --> 01:48:18,179
AMY: Friend, I have to ask...

2432
01:48:18,819 --> 01:48:19,679
Why?

2433
01:48:21,779 --> 01:48:22,979
KRIS: (whispering) Oh sweet Walnut.

2434
01:48:22,979 --> 01:48:25,319
AMY: Is-- KATE: Are you yucking the cat's yum, right now?

2435
01:48:25,319 --> 01:48:26,619
JERRY: "Bring me a chicken."

2436
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:30,460
AMY: Okay. JERRY: "I will decide what happens to the chicken."

2437
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,400
AMY: Okay. KATE: Holy shit!

2438
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:34,819
AMY: That's-- That's-- That's fine.

2439
01:48:34,819 --> 01:48:36,359
RYAN: You're getting cat-sassed.

2440
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:38,099
AMY: I'm just curious. KATE: Cat shade! &gt;&gt; JERRY: Meow!

2441
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:40,899
RYAN: Yeah. This kitten's got claws.

2442
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:42,860
(laughter)

2443
01:48:42,939 --> 01:48:45,519
AMY: Um okay so...

2444
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:49,440
AMY: Walnut is bound by her oath to do this, yeah. JERRY: So you're hunched down in the middle of this inn,

2445
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,159
JERRY: meowing. AMY: So you guys can do other stuff.

2446
01:48:51,159 --> 01:48:54,319
KATE: And you have to conduct a cat-chicken wedding ceremony?

2447
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,680
AMY: Or it's going to eat it.

2448
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,980
AMY: But Walnut did promise the cat-- RYAN: It can do both.

2449
01:48:57,979 --> 01:48:59,739
AMY: so at some point that's going to have to happen.

2450
01:48:59,739 --> 01:49:03,039
JERRY: Yeah. Absolutely. It doesn't have to be job one.

2451
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:04,739
AMY: Sure. &gt;&gt; KATE: Side quest. JERRY: You know what I mean?

2452
01:49:04,739 --> 01:49:06,000
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: Ding.

2453
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:07,880
RYAN: Are we even at the right level for this yet?

2454
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:11,400
JERRY: Right now it's green. No, trust me the chicken-- that's not going to be the hardest thing you guys do today.

2455
01:49:11,399 --> 01:49:12,859
AMY: I'm going to write it in my side quest book. JERRY: Yeah exactly.

2456
01:49:12,859 --> 01:49:13,739
JERRY: So...

2457
01:49:14,359 --> 01:49:15,880
RYAN: Get one chicken.

2458
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:20,460
JERRY: The door to the inn opens.

2459
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:26,139
And a woman in leather armor...

2460
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:32,340
very functional, put to work, leather armor;

2461
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:35,460
with skin the color of a chestnut;

2462
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:37,520
comes in.

2463
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:42,120
Gives a quick nod to the woman behind the bar.

2464
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:47,460
And then off of her shoulder eases a satchel...

2465
01:49:48,359 --> 01:49:53,599
that is emblazoned on the front of it with the sigil of Acquisitions Incorporated.

2466
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:57,659
KATE: Do these people bear any resemblance to the portrait over the fireplace?

2467
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,740
JERRY: No. Not that you can think.

2468
01:50:00,739 --> 01:50:02,639
It could be a very old portrait.

2469
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,380
KATE: Okay. KRIS: I have my suspicions.

2470
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:06,600
AMY: What color are the people's hair in the portrait?

2471
01:50:06,819 --> 01:50:08,539
JERRY: In the portrait? AMY/KATE: Mm-hmm.

2472
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,520
JERRY: Blond.

2473
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:13,440
The boy's hair is cut very short.

2474
01:50:13,439 --> 01:50:14,059
AMY: Okay.

2475
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:16,039
JERRY: And brunette. AMY: Yeah. Got it.

2476
01:50:17,159 --> 01:50:18,239
AMY: Cool. KATE: K.

2477
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:20,860
JERRY: So as I said...

2478
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:26,900
she eases this sack off, drops it at the bar.

2479
01:50:28,119 --> 01:50:33,500
And then: quick nod, turns on her heel, and heads back out.

2480
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:35,859
Like even before the door has closed,

2481
01:50:35,859 --> 01:50:38,339
she's thrown it open, come in, dropped it off.

2482
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:43,020
And then, as she is sort of silhouetted in the doorway,

2483
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:45,540
the woman behind the bar says, "Alby."

2484
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,800
And Alby turns back around, you assume.

2485
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,100
And the woman behind the bar sort of underhands her a roll.

2486
01:50:53,899 --> 01:50:57,119
She catches it and then proceeds to leave.

2487
01:50:57,539 --> 01:51:01,319
You can see through the generous front window

2488
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:04,500
Alby, or whoever it is,

2489
01:51:05,539 --> 01:51:09,899
hangs a small sign underneath the Dran &amp; Courtier sign,

2490
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:16,539
that is the symbol of Acquisitions Incorporated, below.

2491
01:51:16,539 --> 01:51:19,739
And then as she hangs it, she gives it a quick pat.

2492
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:22,760
It sort of sways in the wind and then she continues down the road.

2493
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:25,940
AMY: (gasps) We have a base of operations.

2494
01:51:25,939 --> 01:51:28,379
KATE: Yes! RYAN: I go to the bartender and I say,

2495
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:29,760
RYAN: What is this place?

2496
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,300
KRIS: No, what? JERRY: Yeah.

2497
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:35,220
KRIS: So we're here from-- We're the-- We're them. We're the franchisees.

2498
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:38,560
KATE: Show them the letter. RYAN: Oh. I was gonna lead her down that road.

2499
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,100
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. She says--

2500
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:42,120
KRIS: Why are you asking like you don't even know where we are?

2501
01:51:42,119 --> 01:51:43,460
JERRY: She says,

2502
01:51:43,579 --> 01:51:46,159
"I want to apologize in advance,"

2503
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:50,520
"for whatever my son put you through."

2504
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,040
KATE: That's not really in advance then, is it?

2505
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:59,960
JERRY: "It's before-- ahead of our conversation. I can understand, Grandmother, why you might be..."

2506
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:01,439
"displeased."

2507
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:05,960
"I have told him on multiple occasions, not to use the door..."

2508
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:17,160
"of the Dran &amp; Courtier for his hazing initiation torment palace that his friend Jim made."

2509
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:19,139
"But..."

2510
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:20,520
AMY: Did she say her son?

2511
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,140
KATE: Grandson. AMY: Grandson. Okay.

2512
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:24,980
JERRY: No. Son. AMY: Oh son!

2513
01:52:24,979 --> 01:52:26,719
JERRY: Son. Yeah. KATE: Oh, son. I thought you said-- Okay.

2514
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,600
AMY: (whispering) This is awesome.

2515
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,760
JERRY: "I've told them not to do it."

2516
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:36,940
"I received a letter yesterday saying that I should prepare the rooms upstairs."

2517
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:43,659
"It's been a long time since he has centered a team out of Red Larch."

2518
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,659
KRIS: Oh hmm. JERRY: "But..."

2519
01:52:46,819 --> 01:52:50,119
"I have a guess why he might be doing it again."

2520
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:56,900
"Once you've come back from a couple missions, maybe it's something we can discuss."

2521
01:52:56,899 --> 01:52:58,659
KATE: Ah. we're not high enough level yet.

2522
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,199
JERRY: Gah. Levels aren't real.

2523
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,939
RYAN: So do you like, work for us?

2524
01:53:03,779 --> 01:53:04,899
Because I'm the leader.

2525
01:53:06,279 --> 01:53:07,579
JERRY: "You should open the satchel."

2526
01:53:07,579 --> 01:53:09,079
(laughter)

2527
01:53:09,079 --> 01:53:10,899
RYAN: Is that a yes or...? KRIS: I'm already opening it.

2528
01:53:10,899 --> 01:53:11,920
RYAN: Yeah.

2529
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:22,619
JERRY: So you know that there are roles, duties responsibilities that come along with the license.

2530
01:53:22,619 --> 01:53:25,720
So the advantage of the license is that it gives people...

2531
01:53:27,239 --> 01:53:32,300
You know, if it comes down to two groups, a lot of times they're gonna choose the group that they've heard of.

2532
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,220
KRIS: Right. JERRY: Right?

2533
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:37,820
JERRY: So it allows you a little bit of leeway in a new market.

2534
01:53:37,819 --> 01:53:41,219
Right? If you're just starting out. There's an advantage to it.

2535
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:44,440
Obviously, you need to give up some of the gold from each job.

2536
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,280
But there are also four roles.

2537
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:54,980
You know that each of these franchises has four distinct roles.

2538
01:53:55,939 --> 01:53:57,619
Just like any corporation.

2539
01:53:57,619 --> 01:53:58,859
KRIS: Of course. Yes.

2540
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:03,059
JERRY: And so the first thing you need to do is actually to establish

2541
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,640
who is going to take on which of these four roles.

2542
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:07,160
And all the documentation is present.

2543
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:13,359
As soon as you open it up, it's like when you get your passes from Disneyland.

2544
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:19,260
You open it up and then all the papers and quills are all lined up, ready to go.

2545
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:23,220
JERRY: The documentation-- the first document you get out is basically your...

2546
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:29,399
is a finalized version of the license with space for signatures.

2547
01:54:29,399 --> 01:54:33,279
But each of those signature spaces is associated with one of the four tasks.

2548
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,060
So the first task is the Cartographer.

2549
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:41,399
Second task is called Hoards Person.

2550
01:54:41,779 --> 01:54:44,099
AMY: Wait, Hoards Person? JERRY: Hoards Person.

2551
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:45,200
KRIS: Sure.

2552
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:49,800
JERRY: The Hoards Person maintains stocks, keeps track of coin.

2553
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:53,859
The Decisionist...

2554
01:54:55,159 --> 01:54:57,239
is the tie-breaker.

2555
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:00,840
Their task is whenever there's a vote, they get two votes.

2556
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:02,119
KATE: (laughs)

2557
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:03,560
KATE: Oh my gosh. JERRY: Right?

2558
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:07,140
JERRY: And the final one is called a Documancer.

2559
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:11,240
So a Documancer in Acquisitions Incorporated...

2560
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,639
You know that...

2561
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:18,460
Obviously any contract has a mystical aspect.

2562
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,980
It's like...

2563
01:55:19,979 --> 01:55:22,639
You know, it commands things of people.

2564
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:25,579
KRIS: Yeah. It has its own weave. Yeah. JERRY: Exactly.

2565
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:31,700
JERRY: But the kind of documentation that comes from Acquisitions Incorporated is a step above.

2566
01:55:31,699 --> 01:55:34,579
It has parts of the document that would fill themselves out.

2567
01:55:34,779 --> 01:55:36,819
It can take dictation.

2568
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:43,980
So the type of stationary that comes along with this pack is a step above.

2569
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:48,719
And it requires someone to focus their corporate efforts

2570
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:54,600
specifically on making sure that all this documentation is going back up to the head office directly.

2571
01:55:54,659 --> 01:56:03,859
So every time you take a job, every time you leave a job, certain types of dungeon entrances, plants.

2572
01:56:03,859 --> 01:56:10,079
All these things-- information of this type is all sort of agglomerated together at the head office.

2573
01:56:11,159 --> 01:56:16,920
Which keeps a substantial storehouse of data about the regions it operates in.

2574
01:56:17,399 --> 01:56:21,359
So I need to know who is signing which of these things.

2575
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:23,179
KATE: Okay before we start...

2576
01:56:23,539 --> 01:56:24,359
AMY: Fighting.

2577
01:56:24,439 --> 01:56:26,339
(laughter)

2578
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,739
KRIS: Hold on I'm the Decisionist!

2579
01:56:27,739 --> 01:56:29,619
You sign this part. You sign this part.

2580
01:56:29,619 --> 01:56:31,099
JERRY: There's no bar fight aspect.

2581
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,480
KATE: I have been advised by Patrick Rothfuss,

2582
01:56:33,899 --> 01:56:36,339
Don't sign anything without reading all of it.

2583
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:37,840
Find a fantasy lawyer.

2584
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:43,280
Do we have a fantasy lawyer who can review these documents for us before we sign them?

2585
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:44,719
JERRY: I don't think so. KATE: Okay.

2586
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:47,300
KRIS: Having never heard of a Documancer before,

2587
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:49,440
KATE: Yeah that job sucks. KRIS: I assume we need one of them.

2588
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:50,779
KRIS: And we don't have that.

2589
01:56:50,779 --> 01:56:54,119
KATE: Okay well Rosie is going to read it very carefully.

2590
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:55,439
Every word.

2591
01:56:55,439 --> 01:56:56,219
JERRY: Absolutely.

2592
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:58,960
KATE: Is there anything untoward there?

2593
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,180
AMY: Did Omin write this?

2594
01:57:01,119 --> 01:57:03,760
JERRY: Are you asking me, Jerry Holkins?

2595
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,140
AMY: Yeah. Is this like a-- RYAN: I've never even heard of Omin.

2596
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:07,420
JERRY: Yeah do you want to examine it?

2597
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:08,780
AMY: Yeah I want to examine it.

2598
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:11,020
JERRY: Yeah. Let's see some perception.

2599
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:13,539
AMY: Oh! Popped out of my hand.

2600
01:57:14,739 --> 01:57:15,519
15?

2601
01:57:17,579 --> 01:57:22,180
JERRY: Down in the lower right hand corner, in very small type, it says,

2602
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:25,360
This document prepared personally by Ominifis Hereward Dran.

2603
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:29,979
AMY: I'm immediately grossed out that I'm holding a contract that Omin had anything to do with.

2604
01:57:29,979 --> 01:57:32,619
JERRY: It's vile. AMY: I know he views them as pornographic.

2605
01:57:32,619 --> 01:57:34,199
KRIS: In the other corner-- JERRY: Yeah exactly. Sensual.

2606
01:57:34,199 --> 01:57:37,939
KRIS: In the other corner, C:\Documents and Settings\

2607
01:57:37,939 --> 01:57:42,319
(laughter) JERRY: Yeah exactly. It's the raw printout.

2608
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:43,500
KRIS: Right.

2609
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:49,180
JERRY: But even the document even smells magical. You can assess it if you want to.

2610
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:54,960
KRIS: I want to just to see what level of magic is being dealt with.

2611
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,939
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: Like what have we gotten ourselves into?

2612
01:57:57,939 --> 01:58:01,179
KRIS: So that's all right. It's arcana, that's not going to be great. Uh it's 11.

2613
01:58:01,539 --> 01:58:03,100
JERRY: Okay. Yeah this is...

2614
01:58:04,579 --> 01:58:08,100
This document, it doesn't seem malevolent or nefarious,

2615
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:12,600
but you think that writing on it...

2616
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,020
happen twice.

2617
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:18,000
You think that when you write on it here,

2618
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,500
you think that there's another document somewhere

2619
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,880
that receives the same inscription.

2620
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:25,300
KRIS: It's so valuable.

2621
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:26,720
These magics!

2622
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:29,880
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, but anyway. So we got some documents here to check out.

2623
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:32,579
AMY: Does Cartographer-- that's just like keeping track of where we went?

2624
01:58:32,579 --> 01:58:37,119
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Tracks where you went. But it's specifically mapping for the corporation.

2625
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:40,559
AMY: And the Hoard Person, they just deal with the whole loot.

2626
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,180
JERRY: Yeah they deal with loot, but they also provision jobs.

2627
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:50,439
They make sure you got the supplies to do a specific job, but they also keep track of the gold and treasure.

2628
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:52,260
KRIS: This sounds like a you thing.

2629
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:55,980
RYAN: I see everyone sniffing at their contracts. And I go,

2630
01:58:55,979 --> 01:58:58,159
Isn't this what we were all shooting for?

2631
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:00,279
And then, eh? Time to make a decision!

2632
01:59:00,279 --> 01:59:02,259
And I grab the decision maker sheet.

2633
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:04,159
RYAN: And I say, yeah! I wave it around. AMY: And I go,

2634
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:06,139
AMY/KATE: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2635
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:08,500
RYAN: I don't even know what the rest of the words mean. The only word I know is, Decisionist.

2636
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,560
KATE: I'm still reading. And I'm like, why did he type out all the moaning?

2637
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:14,060
That he has this feeling while writing this contract.

2638
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:15,380
JERRY: Hmm... Hurr…!

2639
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:16,859
KATE: Hmm. Uh... JERRY: Eh...

2640
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:18,579
KATE: Mmm. It's not pleasant.

2641
01:59:18,579 --> 01:59:19,600
JERRY: It's gross. KATE: Gross read.

2642
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:22,300
AMY: Um... KATE: Nasty boy.

2643
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:26,640
AMY: I look at Donaar holding the decision maker and I go--

2644
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:28,940
RYAN: I'm waving it around. I'm not just holding it.

2645
01:59:28,939 --> 01:59:30,759
RYAN: (paper waving sound) &gt;&gt; AMY: And I go, KRIS: You keep it out of our reach.

2646
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:38,000
AMY: Wouldn't someone of your economic stature be more at home keeping track of all the gold and...

2647
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:38,880
RYAN: (paper waving sounds)

2648
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,440
KRIS: He's making a great hoarder. AMY: gems.

2649
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:41,359
JERRY: "In-wealth-inations?"

2650
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:43,719
Yeah, yeah. Dragons specialize in hoards.

2651
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,940
KATE: It's true. It is kind of in your blood. RYAN: Eh...

2652
01:59:45,939 --> 01:59:47,299
KATE: Is that racist?

2653
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:50,039
RYAN: If not me, then who? I don't know.

2654
01:59:50,039 --> 01:59:51,920
AMY: Well it should be someone that's you know...

2655
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:55,579
RYAN: That is willing to sell us out to mice? AMY: Impartial.

2656
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:59,079
AMY: No. Maybe someone who sticks to a strong moral code or ethics.

2657
01:59:59,079 --> 02:00:04,439
KRIS: That's... Yeah. But, I mean, I feel like wisdom could be taken advantage of here.

2658
02:00:04,439 --> 02:00:06,659
Certainly someone who's lived a long time.

2659
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:07,920
Not me.

2660
02:00:08,119 --> 02:00:10,519
I'm a youthful, sprightly drow.

2661
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:11,800
Not that old.

2662
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,100
RYAN: I'm noble! KRIS: Sure.

2663
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:14,860
RYAN: I'm a nobleman. KRIS: I believe you.

2664
02:00:14,859 --> 02:00:16,239
RYAN: You're-- KRIS: I'm saying--

2665
02:00:16,239 --> 02:00:18,599
RYAN: I thought we laid this out. KATE: I'm not interested in making decisions.

2666
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:20,920
KRIS: Ah I see. KATE: I do like mapmaking however.

2667
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:24,279
KATE: So that's where my eyeballs are at. KRIS: I see.

2668
02:00:24,279 --> 02:00:26,239
KRIS: I think that's fine with me.

2669
02:00:26,239 --> 02:00:29,319
KATE: I think that Donaar would make an excellent Decisionist.

2670
02:00:29,479 --> 02:00:30,699
RYAN: Hey!

2671
02:00:30,699 --> 02:00:32,340
That's two votes for Decisionist.

2672
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:34,720
RYAN: And because I'm Decisionist, I get three! KATE: That's actually three.

2673
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,320
So this is easy.

2674
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:37,599
KATE: That's a majority already.

2675
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:39,260
(laughter)

2676
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:40,500
KRIS: Okay.

2677
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,939
AMY: I'm ready to-- KATE: Up top!

2678
02:00:41,939 --> 02:00:46,079
AMY: I'm ready to roll to try and get it away from...

2679
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,539
AMY: To get it away from Donaar. RYAN: I'll try to persuade.

2680
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:49,720
AMY: That's fine. KATE: Ooh.

2681
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:50,880
JERRY: Let's see it. KRIS: Oh yeah!

2682
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:51,960
KATE: Here we go. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Let's see!

2683
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:53,760
KRIS: This is real combat. RYAN: All right. So I roll for persuasion?

2684
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,600
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. AMY: What do I have to roll against?

2685
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,020
RYAN: I want to take an advantage too.

2686
02:00:57,020 --> 02:00:58,800
KATE: Oh nice. Yes! KRIS: Wow!

2687
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:01,300
KRIS: This is a nightmare. JERRY: (laughs) This is the best.

2688
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:04,619
AMY: Walnut would never want to be in charge of loot.

2689
02:01:05,239 --> 02:01:06,380
That makes no sense.

2690
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:07,980
JERRY: You got to make a case. RYAN: That makes it funnier.

2691
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:09,000
KRIS: Yeah.

2692
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,319
KRIS: Oh you know what-- AMY: She would just give it away to poor people.

2693
02:01:11,319 --> 02:01:12,599
KATE: You get provisions too. KRIS: I was going to say--

2694
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,360
KRIS: I was going to say, I don't either.

2695
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:17,340
KRIS: But suddenly I remember that I do. JERRY: Let's see what you got. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Oh.

2696
02:01:17,779 --> 02:01:20,699
KATE: Yeah I think you would an excellent Documancer. RYAN: That's a 17 plus five so...

2697
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:23,179
KATE: You're very brand-oriented. RYAN: 22 or a...

2698
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:25,699
RYAN: Well no. I'll take the 22.

2699
02:01:25,699 --> 02:01:27,779
JERRY: All right 22. AMY: What do I have to roll against that?

2700
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:33,859
JERRY: Well take a look at your sheet and tell me what you think would be a good match for this incredible case he's made.

2701
02:01:33,859 --> 02:01:37,500
AMY: Can I do insight to view his true intentions?

2702
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,560
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: And can I also take advantage?

2703
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,780
RYAN: True intention? My true intention I just told you what it was.

2704
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:45,900
AMY: No, can I roll to know like, oh no, no, no, no. You're trying to--

2705
02:01:45,899 --> 02:01:47,819
RYAN: It's very vapid and not very smart.

2706
02:01:47,819 --> 02:01:51,719
JERRY: It's like is he going to implicate that is really what you want.

2707
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:52,880
AMY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. JERRY: Right? Yeah.

2708
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,260
JERRY: So roll two of these dice. Let's see what you got.

2709
02:01:56,899 --> 02:01:58,979
JERRY: That's a shit show. AMY: That's a one. That's a one. Come one.

2710
02:01:58,979 --> 02:02:00,379
JERRY: That's a toilet dice. AMY: Bigger!

2711
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:02,100
AMY: Ah shit! 17.

2712
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:05,620
JERRY: All right, now how do you convince...

2713
02:02:05,619 --> 02:02:08,180
Tell me about the case you make to Walnut

2714
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:12,699
who does not want to be the Hoards Person.

2715
02:02:12,699 --> 02:02:14,720
RYAN: I say, you don't have to be the Hoards Person.

2716
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:17,780
That's fine with me. I'm not arguing that you're going to be the Hoards Person.

2717
02:02:17,779 --> 02:02:19,599
I'm arguing that I'll be the Decisionist.

2718
02:02:21,239 --> 02:02:23,699
And then I say, maybe I didn't make this clear earlier.

2719
02:02:23,699 --> 02:02:26,720
So, just a little insight, the pecking order goes:

2720
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,960
dragons;

2721
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:29,100
dragonborn;

2722
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:31,740
and everyone else is tied for third, at best.

2723
02:02:33,859 --> 02:02:34,699
AMY: I mean--

2724
02:02:34,699 --> 02:02:38,539
RYAN: I mean we all know this. This is comm-- I'm not telling anybody anything you guys don't already know.

2725
02:02:38,539 --> 02:02:39,819
Right? As I sign.

2726
02:02:39,819 --> 02:02:41,340
(laughter)

2727
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:43,100
KRIS: As I sign. RYAN: As I sign the document.

2728
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,300
RYAN: You know I'm just-- We all know this.

2729
02:02:45,539 --> 02:02:48,159
KATE: I kind of want to convince you that Walnut is a dragon.

2730
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,560
KRIS: Hah! &gt;&gt; JERRY: Has draconic-- KATE: Yeah.

2731
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:53,860
RYAN: I begrudgingly admire all of you. We gone through this together. KATE: I take you aside,

2732
02:02:53,859 --> 02:02:57,299
RYAN: And I'm like, there's probably a little dragon-- KATE: Do you understand? She's actually a dragon.

2733
02:02:57,300 --> 02:02:59,840
RYAN: There's probably a little dragon in all you guys. There's more in me, though.

2734
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:00,560
KATE: Hmm.

2735
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:03,960
RYAN: You know. I mean, you couldn't have gotten through that without having like--

2736
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,739
RYAN: 1/32 dragon. KRIS: Now hold on a second.

2737
02:03:05,739 --> 02:03:08,479
KRIS: Me thinks you doth protest too much.

2738
02:03:08,479 --> 02:03:13,399
Maybe you're putting on a dragon front and actually there's more dragon in somebody else here.

2739
02:03:13,399 --> 02:03:15,599
Because you make a big fuss about it.

2740
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:17,640
RYAN: I say this as I scratch my scales, I say,

2741
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:18,660
All right. Go on.

2742
02:03:18,659 --> 02:03:19,960
KRIS: I didn't say it doesn't look good.

2743
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,680
(laughter)

2744
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:24,740
It's convincing. Maybe even real.

2745
02:03:24,739 --> 02:03:29,659
JERRY: All right. Now do we have any other roles that people will take?

2746
02:03:29,859 --> 02:03:36,500
KRIS: I will... I am interested in Cartographer but I would take Hoards Person if nobody else wants it.

2747
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,260
JERRY: M'kay.

2748
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:42,260
AMY: I guess Documancer's fine because Walnut's name would be on all documents that go to official--

2749
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:44,180
JERRY: That's true. It would go all the way to the top.

2750
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:47,480
AMY: I just want to point out-- This is now Walnut speaking...

2751
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:53,030
Have to deal with this person being able to outvote every move that we make--

2752
02:03:53,029 --> 02:03:54,579
KATE: I think it's great. AMY: for the rest of the campaign--

2753
02:03:54,579 --> 02:03:55,479
AMY: (shouting) Why?

2754
02:03:55,479 --> 02:03:56,559
KATE: Because I'm chaotic good!

2755
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:00,600
KRIS: It's not outvote. It's just a little extra juice if there's a lock.

2756
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:02,000
RYAN: Yeah. A little extra strength.

2757
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,020
RYAN: Like being a dragon. KRIS: We can form a bloc.

2758
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:06,600
RYAN: You know? Just a little stronger than the rest of you lot.

2759
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:09,220
KRIS: I don't like it either. But I think he's--

2760
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,360
AMY: I just think mechanically it's-- KATE: I think it's fine.

2761
02:04:11,359 --> 02:04:13,739
KRIS: Here's the problem. He's already written most of his name on it.

2762
02:04:13,739 --> 02:04:15,920
RYAN: Yeah. I've gotten to the L.

2763
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,500
RYAN: I've gotten to the "Bl." JERRY: He's gotten to the "Aa."

2764
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:18,319
AMY: Okay.

2765
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:20,500
JERRY: Okay, now... RYAN: We don't have erasers.

2766
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:23,840
KRIS: We need to have-- present the home office with a unified front.

2767
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,960
KRIS: I don't want it scratched off. RYAN: Yeah it's just all these different names--

2768
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:27,520
KRIS: We need to solve this. RYAN: scratched or rewritten.

2769
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,340
JERRY: Exactly. So...

2770
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:29,579
KRIS: Yeah. It sucks. KATE: Real test.

2771
02:04:29,579 --> 02:04:34,960
JERRY: The Red Larch chapter of Acquisitions Incorporated is:

2772
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:37,079
Cartographer Rosie.

2773
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:39,619
Hoards Person K'thriss Drow'b.

2774
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,819
Decisionist Donaar Blit'zen.

2775
02:04:41,819 --> 02:04:43,659
And Documancer Walnut Dankgrass.

2776
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:49,220
Obviously there will be things that tie into that stuff later.

2777
02:04:49,479 --> 02:04:54,979
But in the farthest back pouch inside the bag,

2778
02:04:54,979 --> 02:04:56,599
underneath the rain flap,

2779
02:04:57,659 --> 02:05:04,859
are two scrolls sealed with the Acquisitions Incorporated seal.

2780
02:05:04,859 --> 02:05:05,579
KRIS: Hmm.

2781
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:08,559
AMY: Are two scrolls?

2782
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,420
JERRY: Two scrolls. KATE: Sounds like a job for the Documancer.

2783
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:11,579
AMY: I'll take those!

2784
02:05:11,579 --> 02:05:13,619
I look at Donaar like...

2785
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:15,280
AMY: Look what I got. RYAN: And I say...

2786
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:16,800
RYAN: I'll allow it.

2787
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,779
(laughter) RYAN: As the leader I will...

2788
02:05:18,779 --> 02:05:21,139
AMY: It doesn't say leader. It says decision maker.

2789
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:23,119
RYAN: Oh we're going to quibble over terms now?

2790
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:24,619
KRIS: I love it! I love it. KATE: Decisionist.

2791
02:05:24,619 --> 02:05:25,579
KRIS: You will open them.

2792
02:05:25,579 --> 02:05:27,000
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Sure.

2793
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,119
JERRY: So there are-- (laughter)

2794
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:30,439
AMY: Sure. JERRY: Each of these--

2795
02:05:30,439 --> 02:05:35,359
JERRY: It's a black wax with the symbol glinting on the front.

2796
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:44,000
They are both equal in size, weight; they're virtually identical in every way.

2797
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,340
AMY: Cool I crack one open. JERRY: K.

2798
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:49,100
JERRY: You crack one open and it says at the top--

2799
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:56,840
the document is laid out in a very, very clear, established, didactic way.

2800
02:05:57,619 --> 02:05:59,739
And at the top it says,

2801
02:05:59,739 --> 02:06:02,500
Party Security for the Vespertine Order.

2802
02:06:02,939 --> 02:06:04,159
300 gold pieces.

2803
02:06:04,899 --> 02:06:06,500
AMY: Oh... okay.

2804
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:07,760
JERRY: Below that it says,

2805
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:13,820
Sombar Blood-Drinker requests professional defense specialists for a midnight soirée.

2806
02:06:14,739 --> 02:06:17,099
Inquire at the Doomgate Inn.

2807
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,640
AMY: Hmm.

2808
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:20,360
KRIS: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. AMY: Okay.

2809
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:24,020
JERRY: You could ask around about that. You haven't heard of the Doomgate Inn.

2810
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:28,500
AMY: Yeah. I have feelings about somebody with the last name Blood-Drinker. (laughs)

2811
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:30,079
JERRY: That's-- Listen, that's--

2812
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:31,519
It's 1492.

2813
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:34,140
KRIS: Yeah. Not only bad people drink blood.

2814
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:35,520
JERRY/RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: Exactly. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You know?

2815
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,240
AMY: Hmm. KRIS: That's an old idea.

2816
02:06:37,239 --> 02:06:38,359
RYAN: Lot of iron.

2817
02:06:38,579 --> 02:06:40,079
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: All right. Well...

2818
02:06:40,619 --> 02:06:45,559
The second scroll, once unsealed, says,

2819
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:47,720
The Raiding Must Cease.

2820
02:06:47,979 --> 02:06:49,959
AMY: Okay. JERRY: 200 gold pieces.

2821
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:51,139
AMY: Okay.

2822
02:06:51,659 --> 02:06:55,079
JERRY: It is signed by a Lord Vizgig Cartinwheel.

2823
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:56,760
AMY: (laughing) Okay. RYAN: Hmm.

2824
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:05,239
JERRY: It is offered as a job between the town of Beliard and something called Stone Bridge.

2825
02:07:05,239 --> 02:07:07,199
There's a small chunk of the map here.

2826
02:07:08,439 --> 02:07:10,979
And in addition to the 200 gp it says,

2827
02:07:10,979 --> 02:07:13,479
Partial payment in the form of a cart.

2828
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:15,700
KATE: (gasps) &gt;&gt; RYAN: Ooh. AMY: Oh yeah!

2829
02:07:16,539 --> 02:07:18,979
AMY: Oh yeah. KATE: (whispering) Oh yeah! Oh yeah.

2830
02:07:19,159 --> 02:07:20,779
AMY: Sure okay.

2831
02:07:20,779 --> 02:07:24,219
And so I want to read these out loud to the group.

2832
02:07:25,079 --> 02:07:26,739
Or at least the important part.

2833
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,800
And when I do it I want to be like,

2834
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,680
Party security. Yep okay.

2835
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:33,200
JERRY: They have date ranges on them as well. AMY: Oh they do?

2836
02:07:33,199 --> 02:07:35,599
JERRY: Exactly. AMY: Which one is closer?

2837
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:40,840
JERRY: The more immediate one-- the Party Security, is physically closer.

2838
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:44,719
But the date on that is about ten days hence.

2839
02:07:44,899 --> 02:07:47,379
AMY: Ten days. Okay and what's the cart quest?

2840
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:51,819
JERRY: The Raiding Must Cease from Lord Vizgig Cartinwheel...

2841
02:07:51,819 --> 02:07:52,659
AMY: Mm-hmm.

2842
02:07:53,319 --> 02:07:57,779
JERRY: That is a range of time.

2843
02:07:57,779 --> 02:08:03,219
And it appears to be an open contract that other parties may also be able to partake in.

2844
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:03,780
KRIS: Hmm.

2845
02:08:04,399 --> 02:08:05,039
AMY: Hmm.

2846
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:08,640
KATE: Is that range sooner than the Doomgate?

2847
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:15,560
JERRY: Absolutely. You think you'd be able to do both if you were able to knock this first one out.

2848
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:17,680
JERRY: Especially if there's a cart involved.

2849
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:20,020
AMY: Okay so then I turn to the party and I say,

2850
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:21,680
We have two missives.

2851
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:23,840
And this is our first one! And I hold up the cart quest.

2852
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,420
(laughter)

2853
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:27,359
KATE: I believe you a hundred percent!

2854
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:29,199
AMY: I go, this one doesn't start for ten days.

2855
02:08:29,199 --> 02:08:30,439
So we have plenty of time.

2856
02:08:30,439 --> 02:08:32,299
KATE: Crumple it up, throw it in the garbage.

2857
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:34,380
AMY: I... then put it in my...

2858
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,480
KARIS: Little bit details?

2859
02:08:35,479 --> 02:08:36,399
AMY: docum-- KATE: Document sack?

2860
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:38,139
AMY: document sack, apparently. JERRY: Yeah exactly.

2861
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:38,920
RYAN: Satchel.

2862
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:42,359
JERRY: Yeah the satchel should probably be carried by the Documancer.

2863
02:08:42,359 --> 02:08:44,799
AMY: Absolutely. It's already on my person.

2864
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:47,800
JERRY: It's ready to go. The branding? Strong!

2865
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:49,279
AMY: (power up sound effect) JERRY: On the back.

2866
02:08:49,279 --> 02:08:50,500
AMY: Got an item. KATE: Mm-hmm.

2867
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,979
AMY: It's my own special bag of holding.

2868
02:08:51,979 --> 02:08:53,299
Document holding that is!

2869
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:56,840
KATE: (laughing) It's so perfect.

2870
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:58,560
JERRY: It's all quills inside.

2871
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:59,480
JERRY: Like it's just-- AMY: Oh absolutely.

2872
02:08:59,479 --> 02:09:01,000
KRIS: It's so tasteful. AMY: Yeah I have a roll out--

2873
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,760
and it's all just different kinds of quills.

2874
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:05,220
JERRY: Yeah exactly. You choose the right one for this document!

2875
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:09,020
AMY: Oh exactly. I'm already commissioning a special stamp.

2876
02:09:09,020 --> 02:09:11,020
KRIS: They say that the quill chooses the Documancer.

2877
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:13,760
(laughter) AMY: (laughing) The quill chooses the Documancer!

2878
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:16,100
Yes! I said it. And it was funny when I said it.

2879
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:18,539
JERRY: No, it's premium. RYAN: I thought of that. It was great.

2880
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,840
KATE: What's-- The name is Vizgig Cartinwheel?

2881
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:25,239
JERRY: Vizgig Cartinwheel-- Lord Vizgig Cartinwheel. KATE: Lord Vizgig Cartinwheel.

2882
02:09:25,239 --> 02:09:27,119
KATE: And we get a cart? Isn't that a funny coincidence?

2883
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:27,840
JERRY: Mm-hmm.

2884
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,360
AMY: Well he probably has them rolling around. JERRY: Partial payment. &gt;&gt; KATE: Partial payment.

2885
02:09:30,359 --> 02:09:32,659
JERRY: In the form of a cart. KATE: And that's upfront.

2886
02:09:32,939 --> 02:09:34,119
JERRY: Mm-hmm. KATE: Perhaps? Okay.

2887
02:09:34,119 --> 02:09:35,180
KATE: Maybe we need it to-- JERRY: Yeah.

2888
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:37,180
JERRY: It's established. AMY: What kind of cart? Like wheelbarrow?

2889
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:38,640
JERRY: It's established.

2890
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:41,160
JERRY: There is a voucher... RYAN: Like Ghostbusters?

2891
02:09:41,159 --> 02:09:41,979
AMY: Okay.

2892
02:09:43,579 --> 02:09:45,279
JERRY: on the bottom that says,

2893
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:47,119
Waelvur's Wagonworks.

2894
02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:49,059
And then below that is says,

2895
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:52,020
Not Thelorn's Safe Journeys.

2896
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:54,579
And below that it says,

2897
02:09:54,579 --> 02:09:56,079
Prince and Princess.

2898
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:57,760
KATE: Ooh. RYAN/KRIS: Hmm.

2899
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,060
AMY: Huh. Okay.

2900
02:10:00,859 --> 02:10:01,939
Okay.

2901
02:10:03,819 --> 02:10:04,799
KRIS: Sounds pretty--

2902
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:08,860
So I put away Party Security for Bloodsuckers Inc. away.

2903
02:10:08,859 --> 02:10:09,920
JERRY: Exactly.

2904
02:10:10,859 --> 02:10:12,079
Vampires 'R' Us.

2905
02:10:12,079 --> 02:10:13,519
AMY: Yeah. JERRY: Midnight feast!

2906
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:16,800
AMY: So in ten days we'll have a party with some vampires, but not today.

2907
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:18,599
KATE: I don't like vampires.

2908
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,020
AMY: Nobody does. KATE: I don't know why. I just got this feeling.

2909
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:23,180
KRIS: Is that known to us though? RYAN: Yeah you got his false memory.

2910
02:10:23,180 --> 02:10:24,820
KRIS: You said...

2911
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:27,460
We know that the other tasks are--

2912
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:28,939
JERRY: No. I don't think she read the other task at all.

2913
02:10:28,939 --> 02:10:30,399
KRIS: That's what I'm asking. AMY: No, no, no, no, no.

2914
02:10:30,399 --> 02:10:33,319
AMY: I'm saying I did not read anything about it. I said it doesn't start for ten days.

2915
02:10:33,319 --> 02:10:34,899
AMY: This is our first missive. KATE: The cart enthusiast.

2916
02:10:34,899 --> 02:10:36,000
KRIS: Okay. JERRY: That's right.

2917
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,579
KATE: Can I open my Cartographer bag?

2918
02:10:37,579 --> 02:10:38,979
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: Is there stuff in there?

2919
02:10:38,979 --> 02:10:41,359
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Imagine there the--

2920
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:45,339
On the side of it there's something like where a bedroll would ordinarily be,

2921
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:52,320
this is a roll that has a thick vellum in a waterproof sort of spiral case.

2922
02:10:52,619 --> 02:10:56,319
And it detaches from the main bag.

2923
02:10:58,159 --> 02:11:03,380
KATE: So I just got some vellum. You got all this cool document bag? Okay. That's fine, that's fine.

2924
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:05,779
I'm a monk. I live an ascetic lifestyle.

2925
02:11:05,779 --> 02:11:07,239
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Austere.

2926
02:11:07,239 --> 02:11:08,699
JERRY: It's not about possessions. KATE: Exactly.

2927
02:11:08,699 --> 02:11:10,939
JERRY: Know what I mean? It's not about possessions. KRIS: You'd have been more upset if there were more in there.

2928
02:11:10,939 --> 02:11:13,479
KATE: Yeah if there were more stuff, I'd be pissed off.

2929
02:11:13,479 --> 02:11:14,659
JERRY: But give me some shit! Right?

2930
02:11:14,659 --> 02:11:16,279
KATE: Give me some fucking-- JERRY: Give me some fucking shit.

2931
02:11:16,279 --> 02:11:17,000
KATE: Yeah.

2932
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,060
JERRY: All right. That's the situation.

2933
02:11:19,060 --> 02:11:20,860
Your parents have gone away for a week's vacation.

2934
02:11:20,859 --> 02:11:22,539
(laughter) AMY: God!

2935
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,140
JERRY: It's going to come up a lot. KATE: I love that joke. I love that joke.

2936
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:25,820
RYAN: We're at the beach house. Bernie's dead.

2937
02:11:25,819 --> 02:11:35,819
JERRY: So the woman behind the counter has been making drinks and serving food this entire time.

2938
02:11:35,819 --> 02:11:40,619
But then every now and then definitely casting a glance over at the party

2939
02:11:40,619 --> 02:11:45,119
with what seems like a-- almost a sadness, like a wistful look.

2940
02:11:45,619 --> 02:11:46,739
AMY: Can I...

2941
02:11:47,319 --> 02:11:50,880
Since we're in her inn running our business out of their--

2942
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,560
Can I ask her her name?

2943
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,300
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: Oh. Ma'am.

2944
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,680
AMY: Thank you for letting us, ma'am-- JERRY: "Oh. No 'ma'am.'"

2945
02:11:56,680 --> 02:11:57,640
AMY: Oh sorry.

2946
02:11:59,279 --> 02:12:03,340
JERRY: "Well my name is-- my name gives people problem also."

2947
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:05,680
"'Propha' is fine.

2948
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:06,560
AMY: Propha.

2949
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,120
JERRY: "I was born Prophetess Dran."

2950
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:09,400
AMY: Oh!

2951
02:12:09,539 --> 02:12:10,300
Oh.

2952
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:12,159
KATE: Oh! AMY: Propha. Okay.

2953
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:14,319
KATE: I like it.

2954
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:15,519
AMY: And then I just say,

2955
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:20,240
Propha, thank you for allowing us to use this base of operations--

2956
02:12:20,239 --> 02:12:21,460
JERRY: "Oh it's all paid for."

2957
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,659
AMY: Right. True. JERRY: "It's all paid for."

2958
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:27,260
JERRY: "As long as you're alive."

2959
02:12:28,439 --> 02:12:30,979
AMY: Right. JERRY: "There have been challenges in the past..."

2960
02:12:31,659 --> 02:12:35,319
JERRY: "keeping this branch open." KATE: What kind of challenges?

2961
02:12:37,939 --> 02:12:39,819
JERRY: "It's something we can discuss..."

2962
02:12:39,819 --> 02:12:42,299
KATE: I'd love to. JERRY: "It's something we can discuss later."

2963
02:12:42,359 --> 02:12:45,579
KATE: Oh. JERRY: "He only sends people..."

2964
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:48,000
JERRY: "He only..."

2965
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:51,760
And she steps back from the bar for a second.

2966
02:12:54,800 --> 02:13:00,520
"He only operates franchises out of this inn for one reason."

2967
02:13:01,159 --> 02:13:03,579
"And it's something he and I have fought about for years."

2968
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:07,500
"He..."

2969
02:13:08,039 --> 02:13:15,500
And so she turns around and starts absentmindedly just cleaning glasses.

2970
02:13:17,199 --> 02:13:19,260
AMY: I see this-- JERRY: But they're not even getting clean.

2971
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:21,860
AMY: Yeah I see that this is a-- I stop pushing.

2972
02:13:21,859 --> 02:13:25,659
Because I see this is a sensitive subject and we'll probably see her again.

2973
02:13:25,659 --> 02:13:26,979
JERRY: Does anyone else want to approach this?

2974
02:13:26,979 --> 02:13:28,479
KATE: I will definitely keep pushing.

2975
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:30,359
RYAN: Yeah. By "he" you mean Omin right?

2976
02:13:30,359 --> 02:13:35,279
KATE: For what reason does he have groups operating out of this inn?

2977
02:13:35,279 --> 02:13:37,099
JERRY: Persuade. KATE: All right.

2978
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:40,880
KRIS: Hmm. KATE: I can intimidate. But I will not do that right now.

2979
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,300
JERRY: Just mother to mother?

2980
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:43,880
KATE: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Totally. KRIS: I feel like that's-- Wow.

2981
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:45,260
KATE: Do you think-- Like I mean I can do that--

2982
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:47,140
JERRY: No listen, hold on here. Kate, Kate, Kate.

2983
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:49,819
We're playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Don't let me guide it.

2984
02:13:49,819 --> 02:13:52,519
KATE: Okay! JERRY: Right? You can use whatever skill you want.

2985
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:56,540
JERRY: Whatever you think Rosie Beestinger would do is okay.

2986
02:13:56,539 --> 02:13:57,800
KATE: Okay I'm going to try-- KRIS: I mean we have to work here.

2987
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:00,760
KATE: I'm going to try Good Cop approach first. Yeah. AMY: Yeah don't crap where you eat.

2988
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:04,699
KATE: I'm going to try persuasion and give her just like a little like,

2989
02:14:04,699 --> 02:14:06,399
KATE: Come on, I know... AMY: Just don't make our rent go up, please.

2990
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:11,739
KATE: I know exactly how sons, and grandsons, and great-grandsons, and great-great-grandsons are.

2991
02:14:11,739 --> 02:14:13,439
And I rolled a ten, but...

2992
02:14:13,819 --> 02:14:14,920
I'm very old.

2993
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:17,200
And I look very wise.

2994
02:14:17,199 --> 02:14:18,439
(laughter)

2995
02:14:18,699 --> 02:14:26,340
And I just have this extra maternal instinct that I'm just trying to project super hard at her.

2996
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:29,140
Even though I know she looks tough. And she's got the armor on and everything.

2997
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:32,480
And maybe she doesn't have a super great relationship with her son, sounds like they fight a lot.

2998
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:34,279
But I'm just trying really hard to just be like,

2999
02:14:34,279 --> 02:14:38,380
I know... I know how they are. I know how this is.

3000
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:39,940
My son...

3001
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:42,239
Uh. Driebus.

3002
02:14:43,659 --> 02:14:49,619
A hundred years old. Still has not learned how to listen to his mother.

3003
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:51,679
Right there with you.

3004
02:14:52,359 --> 02:14:55,960
Driebus Beestinger, wherever you are, I swear to god.

3005
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:57,380
AMY/RYAN: Driebus.

3006
02:14:58,119 --> 02:14:59,760
KATE: Ugh. Don't get me started on Driebus.

3007
02:15:00,039 --> 02:15:01,560
KRIS: Started thinking about calling my mom.

3008
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,619
KRIS: I'm going to see this as some error. AMY: Call her on the sigil?

3009
02:15:03,619 --> 02:15:04,819
KRIS: Feel a little guilty.

3010
02:15:05,479 --> 02:15:09,839
JERRY: Yeah, her face hardens at this.

3011
02:15:10,659 --> 02:15:11,680
And says...

3012
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:14,380
"If you're around in a week,"

3013
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:17,040
"we'll have this conversation again."

3014
02:15:18,819 --> 02:15:20,859
KATE: Sounds promising. AMY: Walnut's in the back like,

3015
02:15:20,859 --> 02:15:21,799
AMY: (whispering) Told you!

3016
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,520
(laughter)

3017
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:26,119
RYAN: If we're around in a week. KATE: Cool.

3018
02:15:26,439 --> 02:15:27,799
AMY/KATE: Great. RYAN: Ominous.

3019
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:29,159
KATE: Another great sign. JERRY: Yeah.

3020
02:15:29,159 --> 02:15:31,559
KRIS: So whatever this thing is it happens at least weekly.

3021
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,500
(laughter)

3022
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:34,539
RYAN: Thursday-ish.

3023
02:15:34,539 --> 02:15:36,600
JERRY: Once a week. It's Taco Tuesday!

3024
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:37,920
(laughter)

3025
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:40,199
KATE: Gets you every time. JERRY: So you...

3026
02:15:40,439 --> 02:15:44,359
JERRY: You collect your things.

3027
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:48,060
What do you do?

3028
02:15:49,159 --> 02:15:50,979
How do you approach this situation?

3029
02:15:51,319 --> 02:15:53,139
You have a direction.

3030
02:15:53,260 --> 02:15:54,400
You have a job.

3031
02:15:54,739 --> 02:15:56,479
And you're ready to go.

3032
02:15:59,180 --> 02:16:00,800
AMY: Should we...

3033
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,560
Can I say to um...

3034
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,940
Oh I already lost it. What was her name?

3035
02:16:04,939 --> 02:16:05,899
KATE: Propha? JERRY/RYAN: Propha.

3036
02:16:05,899 --> 02:16:06,920
AMY: Yeah, sorry!

3037
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:12,500
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. She is wheeled back and she has casted the occasional hard glance.

3038
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:13,880
AMY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I say,

3039
02:16:14,239 --> 02:16:18,139
Propha, we'd love to get out of your hair and let to continue running your establishment.

3040
02:16:18,439 --> 02:16:22,500
Do you know where we could find a Lord Vizgig Cartinwheel by chance?

3041
02:16:24,199 --> 02:16:25,460
KATE: There is a map.

3042
02:16:25,460 --> 02:16:27,220
AMY: There's a map in there? KATE: And I am a Cartographer.

3043
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:28,480
JERRY: Yeah-- AMY: And I go,

3044
02:16:28,479 --> 02:16:29,939
Propha, nevermind. You got it.

3045
02:16:29,939 --> 02:16:31,659
KATE: (laughs) You seem really busy.

3046
02:16:31,659 --> 02:16:32,899
AMY: You seem really busy. JERRY: Exactly.

3047
02:16:32,899 --> 02:16:36,059
JERRY: So on the document...

3048
02:16:36,059 --> 02:16:38,739
AMY: Oh there's a literal map to him?

3049
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:43,880
JERRY: Well there's a map that covers where the actual job is.

3050
02:16:43,879 --> 02:16:45,579
AMY: Oh okay. JERRY: It doesn't say where it is,

3051
02:16:45,579 --> 02:16:48,180
JERRY: but it says Waelvur's Wagonworks.

3052
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:52,399
And has what you think might be a local address.

3053
02:16:52,399 --> 02:16:53,539
But it's on the same street actually.

3054
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:56,320
AMY: Oh okay. JERRY: Right around the corner basically.

3055
02:16:56,700 --> 02:16:59,120
AMY: In my head when you said map, I thought video game,

3056
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:01,620
and thought map of the dungeon that we have to get into.

3057
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:03,740
KATE: (laughing) Sorry. KRIS: That's very nice of them.

3058
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:06,880
AMY: Wow that was really easy. Yeah, that's why I was like,

3059
02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:08,879
AMY: Well this is a no-brainer! JERRY: No.

3060
02:17:09,079 --> 02:17:13,200
JERRY: In fact, so you leave. You can tell that she is relieved.

3061
02:17:13,579 --> 02:17:17,899
She has had to think about something that she doesn't like thinking about.

3062
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:19,420
And it keeps coming up.

3063
02:17:19,680 --> 02:17:22,720
AMY: Sure. When we keep bringing it up over and over? JERRY: Exactly.

3064
02:17:23,299 --> 02:17:27,959
JERRY: You go out. The last time you have been out here was before you came into this place.

3065
02:17:28,299 --> 02:17:36,579
You can see the Acquisitions Incorporated sign below the Dran &amp; Courtier, gently swinging below.

3066
02:17:36,579 --> 02:17:37,539
AMY: Little swell of pride.

3067
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:38,800
JERRY: That's right.

3068
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:42,260
You make your way out into the main road and across the way

3069
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:45,800
you can see Waelvur's Wagonworks.

3070
02:17:45,959 --> 02:17:52,279
And you think that you probably don't want a ride in any kind of caravan that this person is offering.

3071
02:17:52,579 --> 02:17:56,579
But we will get to that stuff next week!

3072
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:57,900
Next Thursday.

3073
02:17:58,180 --> 02:17:59,760
It's been an absolute pleasure!
