00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:00,610
south one of your first jobs took place

62
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,469
at a at a venue called the doone-gate in

63
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:07,280
which was at that time operated by

64
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:08,500
sambar blood drinker a larper of the

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,590
highest order

66
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,229
indeed he and his coven LARP so well

67
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,750
that they attracted the ire of authentic

68
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:19,689
vampire hunters and they were no longer

69
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,310
able to iterate their prized hobby

70
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:24,469
because they were liquefied it's a

71
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,599
danger of LARPing - like indeed in that

72
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:31,009
you want a toast to death interaction or

73
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,479
what - you gotta there have to be you

74
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,729
know there has a verisimilitude there

75
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,729
has to be like a pause button on it yeah

76
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:43,819
you know as soon as the swords come out

77
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:46,488
but you also met a teen werewolf named

78
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,810
Trevor who was you know at a rough he

79
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,090
was sort of at a crossroads he was at a

80
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,780
rough period a rough patch he got some

81
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,969
good advice from Walnut dawn grass this

82
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,009
allowed him to seek out and sort of

83
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,169
become a new person with the help of the

84
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:03,439
party he's now operating the doone-gate

85
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:07,339
in and which has become an inn not for

86
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,709
weary travelers but for weary creatures

87
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,158
of various kinds that don't quite fit in

88
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:15,170
anywhere else it is a strange menagerie

89
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:19,009
that the party walked into

90
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:22,969

I have you seen it firsthand but morning

157
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:17,060
has broken at the doone-gate in it's

158
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:20,030
basically you know party central around

159
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,730

you know when the when the evening

162
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:29,599
starts to roll around you start getting

163
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,159
those those you know a certain clientele

164
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,070
and then you have the nocturnal

165
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,170
clientele the solely nocturnal clientele

166
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:38,120

another cadre sort of sweeping through

171
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,910

172
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,150

an underserved market um sorry targeted

177
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,159
a demographic I kicked this off by

178
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,930
saying that walnut laid in bed last

179
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,240
night wondering if karmically they had

180
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,610
offset all the other things they had

181
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,710
done by how much good they had done for

182
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,569
all of these we were folk suppose you

183
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:21,319

has been the first couple times like

366
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:45,379
this is really the third trip you've had

367
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,899
a chance to take with corriander 2.0 yes

368
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:50,000
tell me about her upgrades a performance

369
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:58,100
life look at a horse power we dealing

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:59,809
with now accurate okay after I make

371
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,959
those noises when I'm mad at myself I'm

372
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:04,789
about 11 exactly because there's a type

373
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:09,919
of happiness that you don't like my kids

374
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:13,188
good oh god that's so coriander 2.0

375
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,709
whose ultimate coriander a Android I'm

376
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:19,850
like in cilantro cilantro is very

377
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:24,740
tasteful as well but the the main thing

378
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:27,490
that you notice is that coriander was

379
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,730
not really up to pulling this cart

380
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,740
very well previously yeah that that's

381
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,480
the main thing you notice is that this

382
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,159
must be what it's like if a horse is

383
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,700
matched to its task ah coriander

384
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:46,000
coriander did her best but there was a

385
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,220
lot of there was there was clearly an

386
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,470
enthusiasm perhaps even an enthusiasm

387
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,038
for you that allowed her to manage that

388
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:57,190
along with the occasional druid spell to

389
00:17:54,038 --> 00:18:00,908
bust the strength but yo yo exactly but

390
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,880
the coriander is is a horse you can be

391
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:06,610
proud Oh wonderful my little metal freak

392
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,409
mm all right well I'm still up atop

393
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:10,449
telling her stories like she's not made

394
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:15,159
of metal implants now she's still

395
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:17,679
getting the the most basic rose would be

396
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,990
singer life story yeah like still going

397
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,419
where we barely hit the team so she's

398
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,490
got she's got a lot going and you guys

399
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:26,740
can be interested probably because it's

400
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,079
alright yeah it's so great you're

401
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,880
missing so much backstory on backstory

402
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:35,408
that you doesn't want it right here in

403
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,450
front of you making a meal yeah yeah but

404
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:40,000
we know the way to UM to barge right

405
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:44,470
yeah I'm a teen film and WOM fir'd yeah

406
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,808
it needs between the barge right in well

407
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:52,058
the end that's that not film okay you

408
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:54,819
need okay I don't know okay so if we do

409
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:56,918
that we go there okay again just south

410
00:18:54,819 --> 00:19:00,778
along the long road starts to curve to

411
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:04,509
the east barge right in is present

412
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:08,679
you've moved directly through that small

413
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:10,450
Enclave and then you can see even in the

414
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,380
distance you can see what looks like a

415
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:19,149
large ship and it only gets larger the

416
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:22,299
closer you get well absolutely but it

417
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:26,648
seems big from back here and then it

418
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:30,129
continues to impress with its internal

419
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:35,288
volume you can see that it's it's clear

420
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:38,770
that this is not a minor stop for this

421
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:41,099
vessel it's clearly being is visit quite

422
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:45,150
the operation underway here

423
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:47,819
to restock this pleasure barge you can

424
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:51,960
see lizard folk directing traffic

425
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:55,769
directing carts like full carts up into

426
00:19:51,960 --> 00:20:00,269
the guts of the horse right and so we

427
00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:02,668
should take a moment to sort of detail

428
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:07,470
what type of vessel we're looking at

429
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:10,530
here sir so imagine imagine in North

430
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:15,419
with a classic riverboat style sort of

431
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:17,599
block multi-deck block of seagoing

432
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:20,159
prowess now

433
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,639
imagine that there is a water wheel in

434
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:28,730
the back that turns but draped over this

435
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:31,409
massive wheel is a gigantic wooden tail

436
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,890
that goes over the top and you can see

437
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:37,710
coming up from that tail there our

438
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:40,350
spines almost like a Stegosaurus spines

439
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,710
on the tail cap it comes up there's

440
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:46,759
three on each side and as you get closer

441
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:50,400
you can see that these have windows and

442
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:53,069
liver and O's on them

443
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,850
so it's this is this you don't know

444
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:59,220
about the rest of the lodgings that are

445
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:01,649
contained inside this vehicle but you

446
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,100
can tell that they are there is they

447
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:09,059
have an aspiration for a very very high

448
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:11,819
level clientele okay on this craft those

449
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:13,019
seem like the luxury that we got here

450
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,950
that's your guess and they are

451
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:18,089
substantial ok but as I said you can

452
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,600
tell there's definitely multi deck

453
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:23,879
structure but you know in terms of it

454
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,879
like the outer walkway there really is

455
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:30,000
just one main one that goes around you

456
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,370
can see them being brushed and swept and

457
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,880
like I said it's substantial enough that

458
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:39,529
entire cards full of supplies are just

459
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,150
wheeled straight up and into this vessel

460
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:44,548
then the closer you get to the front you

461
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:48,330
can begin to see that it perfectly

462
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:51,269
mirrors a dragon's body so that tail is

463
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:54,558
draped over that wheel and then just

464
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:58,249
beyond that or two haunches

465
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:03,798
once on each side there ha ha family

466
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:05,899
show funny when you launch yeah so the

467
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:07,519
face that launched a thousand ships so

468
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:13,368
remember we say haunch a lot and really

469
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:16,429
huh so imagine the tail comes back and

470
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:18,408
then the two rear legs sort of go around

471
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:21,288
the front sort of Bend around the front

472
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:22,759
and the wheels contained there so the

473
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:24,470
whole body sort of looks like it's

474
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:28,099
clutching they sort of look down thing

475
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:32,298
as it floats in the water and you can

476
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:35,658
see that each of a massive dragon on the

477
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:39,319
front of the ship and in its mouth

478
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:41,659
from left to right all the way all the

479
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:46,269
way around the front of the ship you can

480
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:52,309
see in an elaborate stained glass

481
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:55,940
construction it's all tall triangles

482
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:58,638
almost like a almost almost like glass

483
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,129
teeth hmm sort of go around the front

484
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:03,798
and then the closer gets to the front

485
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:07,819
there's more inner structure to support

486
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:09,769
it geometrically okay you can see that

487
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,178
you know even up beyond that you can see

488
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:12,649
the dragon's eyes and you think you

489
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,480
might actually see people in there

490
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:17,058
somewhere

491
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,819
sounds like a Disney cruise or it's a

492
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:20,499
themed cruise there it has character

493
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:24,408
dining

494
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:25,730
um don't see those with that I will

495
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:31,220
believe well the character the dragon

496
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:32,149
yes well normal is also very good leave

497
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,700
me here

498
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:36,618
it's the mouth of the Dragon Tama like

499
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,009
ah did them at you that the mouth is

500
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:43,069
definitely open but it's the entire open

501
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:45,950
part of the structure is plastered

502
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:48,589
completely with these interlocking glass

503
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,840
triangles okay is there a pool

504
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:53,959
oh there may be a pool in sight away

505
00:23:50,839 --> 00:24:03,259
vital yeah you want a boot boogie board

506
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:07,640
yeah okay okay it looks really good

507
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:09,980
so cenar as our burliest

508
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,240
I think that you should probably the one

509
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:17,839
be the one to find the security detail

510
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,990
job that we are applying for it's true

511
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:26,509
okay we have to go find the person we're

512
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:30,230
reporting to yeah okay who is a boot I

513
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:31,579
don't know if we had a name now posted

514
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,250
by the dragon stores River growing house

515
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:37,669
of chance yeah the whole boat but I want

516
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:40,640
to point out this might be easier

517
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,980
because the dress not here however they

518
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,770
said that's a river going gambling

519
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:49,309
parlor demands equally tasteful

520
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:50,740
protection so right we just all be on

521
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:55,250
our best behavior

522
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,059
understood no problem is it really well

523
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,819
by the docks

524
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:02,289
yeah exactly I look for the foreman I

525
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:07,720

00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:10,579
great I mean yeah he is Kia's currently

527
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,950
you try to introduce this piece of

528
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:15,589
information into this system and you are

529
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:18,350
not yet a part of this system you can

530
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:21,619
see people being people are lined up

531
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:26,139
almost like in a military line and

532
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:29,779
they're being upgraded by a lizard man

533
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,240
who is just some of them he's trying to

534
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:34,670
make adjustments trying to bring them in

535
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,420
line with what they require even just

536
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,880
visually and some are not able to do it

537
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,570
some are very very small okay and

538
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,570
they're not allowed on so I'm yelling

539
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:49,189

I can't believe how rude Disco's yeah

on rude okay grandma bar yeah I don't

545
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:04,399
know if there if I can do much better

546
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:05,690

disheartened that it would come to a

773

gatekeeping experience that you okay so

774

far there's a point system yeah you're

778
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:11,449
losing right now I think it starts at

779
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,519
zero okay cool

780
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:19,788

yeah like a tree made out of muscles

792
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:02,028
like this is a this is a person who

793
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,338
hurts people professionally okay you

00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:06,920
know what I mean well yeah yeah how is

795
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:09,139
he heavily armored but no he is not

796
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,249
I didn't say in fact he has very very

797
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:15,650
simple garb okay all right I want to

798
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,078
make it very clear as I'm lifting ready

799
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,190
myself I'll make it very clear that this

800
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,528
is just a demonstration

801
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,869
yeah and expect this is a demo mode yeah

802
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:26,420
this should not be attempted unless you

803
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:28,400
are professional and perfect this is

804
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,200
this is not intended to hurt you but I

805
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,539
could you up if I wanted to and so

806
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,629
I'm going to go ahead and and do my my

807
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:39,140
my good my fancy little bit of

808
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:40,700
which is the 1 2 3 ok oh I know what

809
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:43,759
this is and I'm going to I'm going to

810
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:45,018
I'm going to really like play it up in

811
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:47,298
you're in the theater of the mind

812
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:48,979
everybody but like imagine her just like

813
00:38:47,298 --> 00:38:49,619
adding a bunch of like flourishes and

814
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,940
what

815
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,650
Jeff spent but like doesn't yeah huh she

816
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,599
doesn't need to but it's more

817
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,829
frightening to start this away this

818
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,409
thing yeah like you do that with a

819
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:07,079
disadvantage place almost Oh Jefferson

820
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:13,679
okay okay okay okay okay so that's a 23

821
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:16,259
and that's what lucky yes that's what 13

822
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,419
okay no these are beautiful he's not

823
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,360
Anna Lee armor okay okay dexterous but

824
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,639
he's not heavily armored okay so then

825
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,500
I'm going to I'm just going to keep

826
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:26,940
going I don't even want to roll damage

827
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,340
on him okay

828
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,409
like yeah totally it's not an image you

829
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:35,600
can track this many you like okay okay

830
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:37,769
so this one is power rules this one

831
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,259
around up very small I've come around

832
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:42,659
and whacked him in the back of the knees

833
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,640
exactly and then connect recall that

834
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:47,639
anytime the staff of the master strikes

835
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,710
yeah it disorients opponents okay your

836
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:52,409
melee strikes become da facility six

837
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,909
right so while he was disoriented I'm

838
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:57,389
going to punch him in like each of his

839
00:39:53,909 --> 00:40:00,179
butt cheeks launches right into

840
00:39:57,389 --> 00:40:03,269
conscious um so that what each but just

841
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:06,059
about hunch and that's a a disparate

842
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:08,940
hunch 24 to 15 did you do this available

843
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:11,940
punch arise around the tail just pop pop

844
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:15,030
in the but that's all I can reach right

845
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:18,840
in the bird yeah yeah and I know my

846
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:21,960
daughter's watching so yes I want to see

847
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:24,390
it have the staff connects you've

848
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,829
cranked the theatrical aspects of this

849
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:32,129
right and then you've delivered to rump

850
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:34,409
strikes right and that way with with

851
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,990
precision right so clearly pulled

852
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:38,699
punches right this is this is just like

853
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:40,649
the attract mode at the arcade crack

854
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:42,089
right and I'm going to leap back in

855
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,880
front of them placidly

856
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:46,500
yes so he I think they're going to let

857
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,510
me under the to hunch that the two

858
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:55,739
punches destabilize his rump oh you know

859
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:57,870
what I mean yeah yeah so he bit he falls

860
00:40:55,739 --> 00:41:00,149
forward on its on his knees and he's on

861
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:01,739
oh jeez I'm sorry I'm sorry

862
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,550
hands are done here I want to help I

863
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,759
want to reach out

864
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:08,940
up up and then you see you see like you

865
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:14,510
see his back arch and you see that he

866
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:19,289
like he starts to sort of vibrate almost

867
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:24,780
and then you hear him nice okay okay

868
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:27,840
good yeah he uses up on one hand thumbs

869
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:31,350
up I like you I'm on about

870
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,019
G cos my car dislocated but it's my

871
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:35,789
special move

872
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:38,000
look out potentially in but city has an

873
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:42,779
she has a maneuver so you are you are

874
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,880
massing up here on this single layer of

875
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:49,350
this gigantic

876
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,030
draconic money cake that the lizard folk

877
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:55,019
are operating under the guys over

878
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:57,330
options horde and ii you can see that

879
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:59,940
the other people who have been who you'd

880
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:03,059
previously seen in the line they're sort

881
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,610
of all congregating in this area and it

882
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:09,480
is at about this time that you see three

883
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:14,960
lizard folk emerge from the central core

884
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:19,829
of this establishment but one of them

885
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:23,159
clearly designated as a higher rank than

886
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:27,360
the rest is like much more in terms of

887
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:28,230
jewelry and then the textiles main

888
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,079
evidence thread-count

889
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:34,440
oh yeah it's just a superior version of

890
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:38,610
everything his satellites are trying to

891
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:42,260
execute and failing so they take you in

892
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:48,360
and they give you a tour of the facility

893
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:50,430
that you will be helping out with so the

894
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:54,480
first thing that you see as you enter

895
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:56,429
the boat proper is you sort of come in

896
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,289
at the ground floor you can see that

897
00:42:56,429 --> 00:43:01,399
there the ceiling here is lower than it

898
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:09,659
is out near the front of the boat and

899
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:11,940
leading up to this glass crawl is a sort

900
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:14,548
of two tiered stage

901
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,880
and you you're familiar with this a

902
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:20,788
two-tiered stage and at the top it has

903
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,380
there's some kind of artifact there so

904
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:24,359
that there's something significant on

905
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,690
the stage already you have to be closer

906
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:30,239
to see what it is but ringed around this

907
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:34,849
you're going to Triple Door yeah yeah of

908
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:38,608
course ring around these two stages are

909
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:44,190
seating there's plenty of individual

910
00:43:38,608 --> 00:43:46,889
tables plenty of seats and but down that

911
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:49,588
ramp and out here are various gambling

912
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:51,028
tables all of them ready to roll and you

913
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:52,679
can you can see you can see that they're

914
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:55,498
ready to start taking money from people

915
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:58,458
the moment they get on like the very

916
00:43:55,498 --> 00:44:02,998
entrance is already ready to go your

917
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:06,598
handlers take you up to the flat part at

918
00:44:02,998 --> 00:44:10,379
the top of that stage and you're welcome

919
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,880
to examine yeah what this is but as you

920
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,680
get you get here you can see what was

921
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,910
giving you the sense of it there is a

922
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:22,379
sort of faint glow emanating up from a

923
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:26,159
very exacting diagram that has been

924
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,989
inscribed into the platform itself I

925
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:38,129
want to take a peek at that you do a

926
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:40,829
little perception here ah 15 I'm 14 I've

927
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:44,729
got a book yes it's I mean this is - no

928
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:48,089
I mean it's like a laser did it wizard

929
00:44:44,728 --> 00:44:50,068
this day doing it on the right yeah this

930
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:52,949
is definitely some business some wizard

931
00:44:50,068 --> 00:44:55,288
going on wasn't up the asker

932
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:57,869
people that are with us yeah I think

933
00:44:55,289 --> 00:45:00,410
what's that about yeah - a teleportation

934
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:04,469
circle VIPs only

935
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:07,159
Fleming it means if you spend enough in

936
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:10,469
this casino will teleport you in

937
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:13,389
somewhere wherever you want it's worth

938
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:19,749
it for us to do huh

939
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:22,358
so but from this he I was almost no

940
00:45:19,748 --> 00:45:24,368
speech he's just sort of flex directing

941
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:26,588
your attention to different things and

942
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:28,989
it may be that multiple languages are

943
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:32,619
spoken by this group but it's pretty

944
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:34,900
profound tree you can see that from this

945
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:39,338
stage you can look up and there are two

946
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:43,720
separate layers above as well all and

947
00:45:39,338 --> 00:45:45,998
both of them have view to the stage so

948
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:46,509
all of this around here the big big

949
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:49,538
Tadeo

950
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:55,509
massive um everything around here on the

951
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:58,059
base tables dining area and then two

952
00:45:55,509 --> 00:46:01,119
separate layers above and you can tell

953
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:04,930
the finery like either there's clearly

954
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:07,509
like a gambling caste system at play

955
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:09,159
here you know what I mean all the high

956
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:12,548
rollers oh yeah I'm going to right there

957
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:15,788
literally high rollers here around from

958
00:46:12,548 --> 00:46:17,768
the side two staircases go up and they

959
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:19,900
allow you access to this but in order to

960
00:46:17,768 --> 00:46:22,298
get access to the very top that's

961
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:26,170
actually physically guarded by people at

962
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:27,449
least as large as the lizard man you

963
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:31,989
impressed out front

964
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:34,568
that's an established location how many

965
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,068
of levels of High Roller E are we

966
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:37,929
talking there's a high there's a high

967
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:39,880
high level of rollory at the very top

968
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:43,989
and then as a tier down there this sort

969
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:47,980
of exists it's nicer than the ground

970
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:50,588
floor okay but it's not may no is not

971
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:53,769
actively sure physically guarded we have

972
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:55,900
by guards and weapons like Paul Grande

973
00:46:53,768 --> 00:47:01,179
then yeah exactly that's very well put

974
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:03,519
it's very well put and then he sort of

975
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:10,449
guides you to the next area with his

976
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:14,758
shoulder below the stage itself there is

977
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:18,989
some access that goes beneath the stage

978
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:24,159
and this is where you can already see

979
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:27,068
waiters bringing out the silverware and

980
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:29,528
platters getting this place ready

981
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:31,958
you go straight down through there that

982
00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:35,318
gives you access to the kitchen he takes

983
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:38,318
you from the kitchen through an area

984
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:41,409
that is clearly where the waitstaff

985
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:42,818
stays that looks like it's not there's

986
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:48,159
not very many of them is it clearly

987
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:52,420
distinct from the rest back behind that

988
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:57,038
there is a sort of open ish area that

989
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:59,739
has a very large column in the very

990
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,430
center the rest of it is open that sort

991
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:06,699
of goes up some consuming structural

992
00:48:02,429 --> 00:48:09,698
behind that you go into basically a a

993
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:12,759
largely open area that it seems like

994
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:16,358
many of the crew basically live in

995
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:20,108
community they live together and you can

996
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:24,420
also see in the very center what clearly

997
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:28,420
must be the Volt so they sleep you know

998
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:32,170
more than a hundred physically around

999
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:37,739
the Volt Wow how big assault the vault

1000
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:40,239
itself is probably thirty feet on a side

1001
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:45,458
in the center you see more of what you

1002
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:49,599
might call lizard sure literally we

1003
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:51,009
asked about that little sure what's

1004
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,609
up with that with your chest don't touch

1005
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:57,039
it I won't what does it do it keeps

1006
00:48:54,608 --> 00:48:59,920
people from touching it I think I look

1007
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,809
at the fuel-injection I know um in order

1008
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:07,690
to adequately perform our services I

1009
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:14,259
need to I need to have a visual on the

1010
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:16,630
object that we are protecting I need to

1011
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:18,608
or - what - whatever it is you want us

1012
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:21,759
to you to protect I need to I need to

1013
00:49:18,608 --> 00:49:25,958
physically see it just that's it the

1014
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:32,619
vault place what's inside it gold and

1015
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:34,899
gems I need to see them Tyrion said

1016
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:36,849
is something so it's a very special

1017
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,760
power that she has it actually works

1018
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:42,579
extremely well it's just a specific

1019
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,550
druid thing it's just this sounds like

1020
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:47,769
wizard yeah I've enough stuff in

1021
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:50,310
unfortunately I wish I had more of it

1022
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:53,489
myself but that's why we keep her around

1023
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:57,130
tell me exactly what you intend to do I

1024
00:49:53,489 --> 00:50:00,250
merely need you to open the vault I need

1025
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:06,250
to look at what's inside it and I need

1026
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:09,849
to muster the amount of energy it's

1027
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:12,550
going to take to protect this within

1028
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:14,889
myself and it is I just need to see

1029
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,840
inside it just a moment one second I

1030
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:18,099
will happily roll it works like a charm

1031
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:22,150
I've never seen anything like it

1032
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:25,329

me I'm going to the Vanderburgh no no

1039
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:47,019
and I don't want to try and charm him

1040
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:49,570
because it's going to be trying it just

1041
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:51,190
can't just creates problems does it why

1042
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:54,970

00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:12,160
to look okay he says stand over there

I'm Stangl where you can sort of see in

1049
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:21,969
a crack of the door he goes over to it

1050
00:51:16,989 --> 00:51:26,289
and cups his hands by the key cold and

1051
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:29,529
whispers into it and they says I'm going

1052
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:33,190
to regret this I know it it spins a

1053
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:37,320
crank and then opens it up a crack right

1054
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:39,610
there is gold in there do I see anything

1055
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:42,070
outstanding in there there is so much

1056
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:43,539
gold through this crack there's got to

1057
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,890
be corners and this thing that you can't

1058
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:49,009
see but it is

1059
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:51,920
it looks like a diorama just like

1060
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:55,550
castles made out of gold do I see any

1061
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,619

so he leaves you he leads you back sort

1070
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:34,460
of up the mechanism behind this communal

1071
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:35,149
area there are some stairs that come up

1072
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,630
in the back

1073
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:42,590
you are now behind the lower the gaming

1074
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:45,890
floor opposite side this is where the

1075
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:48,440
rest look the standard quarters are like

1076
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:51,019

1079
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:59,809
of exist people pay in their space don't

1080
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,369
wear fiddle playing like where the wheel

1081
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:04,789
is and you can you can see it being

1082
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:07,549
maintained you can see like their rods

1083
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:09,469
and pistons that move underneath that

1084
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,690
layer is this intended to be where we're

1085
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:12,980
staying

1086
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:16,309
these are the rooms that are provided

1087
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,329
yes I'm saying - yeah sure it's better

1088
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:20,210
run some that's right

1089
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:23,949
no is the vault below us right now I'm

1090
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:27,619
just their vault this yeah yeah okay

1091
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:29,689
other ways to get into this room down

1092
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:32,389
just drill through the floor what's

1093
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:37,840
beneath the vault water are you asking

1094
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:41,440
him yeah rods and pistons that guide the

1095
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,460
waterwheel and then the river this one

1096
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,380
alternate ways into that room we're

1097
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,679
expected to protect a room there's more

1098
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,090
than one way into the door a lot of the

1099
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:52,909
security that we're going to require is

1100
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:55,630
going to be on the floor of the vault

1101
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:58,849
the vault is only one source of of

1102
00:53:55,630 --> 00:54:05,820
problems and as you see

1103
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:07,500
my brothers can probably handle this and

1104
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,720
share down here with us are you

1105
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:14,010
unpacking that no no and in fact as you

1106

Suites exactly what candy exactly the

1110
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:26,250
the sort of spikes that come up off the

1111
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:31,170
tail

1112
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:33,360
yeah it links please spikes but as

1113
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:38,099
you're being led out into the common

1114
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:40,530
area you can see you can see cher coming

1115
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:43,079

00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,469
carry them everywhere that's true

1118
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:49,710
that's you we're in the middle of

1119
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:51,509
getting a tour are you are you working I

1120
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:53,670
don't I don't bother you I don't work

1121
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:56,430
basically unless Varma dies so oh I did

1122
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:59,940
okay good for a while um it's I believe

1123
00:54:56,429 --> 00:55:02,149
her name is Brahma Oh what what what

1124
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,539
again it's all right how much mother

1125
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:05,250
that's okay

1126
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:09,029
I heard her name mentioned in passing

1127
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:13,800
once uh and I haven't had in mind for

1128
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:17,910
name Fujino well we are about to get a

1129
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,920
tour of the High Roller area if you feel

1130
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:21,239
like tagging along on my wood yeah

1131
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,720
otherwise I just sleep under a bunch of

1132
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:28,019
Pistons why was that over such a kind of

1133
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:31,409
a good opportunity I mean it sure is not

1134
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:33,840
working anyway because obviously Brahma

1135
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:36,599
is going to play and we don't have our

1136
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,680

just went to school for the war loot I

1138
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:46,769
would never put my daughter in line of

1139
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:49,920
fire unless she's super duper wanted to

1140
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:51,090
and then she kick ass sorry I said I

1141
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,000
mean I'm only going off of what I

1142
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:55,559
learned last time from Grievous just

1143
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,500

work

1159
00:56:31,769 --> 00:56:37,769
this is good I learned about watching

1160
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:41,190
you love it yeah hmm that's right so

1161
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:45,750
you're their lead again from here down

1162
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:48,420
through the main floor gambling area to

1163
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:52,880
see the stage in the distance your lead

1164
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:56,760
of the staircase through here he nods

1165
00:56:52,880 --> 00:57:00,210
the guards nod and you're able to go

1166
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:03,600
back through a set of golden doors and

1167
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:05,970
these golden doors open into a set of

1168
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:11,039
staircases that's split in the middle

1169
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:15,929
and go two ways down and you can see

1170
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:18,659
that every every so often every 150 feet

1171
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:21,809
or so there's another door another exit

1172
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:24,210
and then these stairs continue downward

1173
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:26,159
but there it's all well-lit key or

1174
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:29,039
anything like that like everything is

1175
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:32,039
everything is immaculate in this area

1176
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:35,789
all the finest touches you know brass

1177
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:38,400
handles hmm took a Millie I can you Dom

1178
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:40,019
what is what the doors look like the

1179
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,829
doors themselves yeah the doors

1180
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:45,659
themselves all have as I said the brass

1181
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:51,289
handle but they have a lock over them

1182
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:55,559
okay and he says that guests are given a

1183
00:57:51,289 --> 00:57:57,509
key they call a magic word and so no one

1184
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,789
else can access a given room without the

1185
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:01,410
magic word okay each room has its own

1186
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:05,429
magic word each room has its own magic

1187
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:07,589
word okay if a guests were to get locked

1188
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:09,539
out of a magic there they forget their

1189
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,269
magic mirrors choose the magic word okay

1190
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:13,769
let's say you've had a little too much

1191
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:15,869
to drink on the floor and you forget

1192
00:58:13,769 --> 00:58:19,019
your magic word who we send them to to

1193
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:21,900
like get their magic word reset if if it

1194
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:26,880
ends up being something like that

1195
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:29,608
um send for me what's your name mellow

00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:34,460

00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:53,730

area and it can very easily see it but

1209
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:10,588
this area with these rooms is actually

1210
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:13,288

lizard-men

1232
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:13,740
come and take people away there's

1233
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:19,289
something about this process of leading

1234
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:23,399
people around it is only the four of you

1235
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:25,650
left in the original group that had come

1236
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,608
through there people are failing some

1237
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:29,430
kind of a test

1238
01:00:26,608 --> 01:00:31,889
oh you think interesting okay so just

1239
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:33,509
silently wordlessly they're just being

1240
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:35,049
dragged away until you've been asking

1241
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:37,270
questions and now it is only before

1242
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:38,620
and then metaphors can tell us that a

1243
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:43,630

a like below no one harumph

1253
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:15,039
there is a there is a start like that

1254
01:01:13,179 --> 01:01:19,509
you can feel the boats or lurch for a

1255
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:21,969
second oh and then here back here on the

1256
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:25,420
tail you can sort of feel it's just

1257
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:28,059
gentle it's not it isn't jarring anyway

1258
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:31,320

to move I got back here so what kind of

1260
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:36,400
security it sounds like we're going to

1261
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:39,160
be on the floor with the performers and

1262
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,300
the gambling is that the kind of thing

1263
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:42,159
where you just want us roaming around

1264
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,450
making sure nothing bad is happening is

1265
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,940
there a particular thing we're supposed

1266
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:47,230
to be guarded no will will direct you

1267
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:51,059
where it's needed

1268
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:54,579
okay many of these situations of course

1269
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:58,719
we can handle ourselves but they're

1270
01:01:54,579 --> 01:02:01,659
going to be situations where a different

1271
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,789
approach may be required than we're

1272
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:06,549
accustomed to

1273
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:09,250
to be at walkie-talkies or anything to

1274
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:11,800
be able to communicate zones yeah yep

1275
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:17,260
engine is TC he says you want to try to

1276
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:19,720
be you want to try to be in view of me

1277
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:22,900
or one of my other tenants and we'll be

1278
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:24,339
communicating with you that way okay so

1279
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:28,510
are we expected to be like plain clothes

1280
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:33,400
like secret no it's vitally important

1281
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:35,530
that you look just as you look now I'd I

1282
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:38,220
want I want people to understand that

1283
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:41,740

1422
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:18,519

rough it and I think that's walnut gets

1424
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:23,110
to rest honey yeah I feel like you're

1425
01:10:21,429 --> 01:10:23,529
the person I can't know anything about

1426
01:10:23,109 --> 01:10:25,359
music

1427
01:10:23,529 --> 01:10:26,948

that should do this yeah I think you're

1432
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:36,969
the right person

1433
01:10:34,118 --> 01:10:40,808

01:10:46,658 --> 01:10:54,839
okay mash it all right

1438
01:10:51,219 --> 01:10:57,038
all right let's do this okay that

1439
01:10:54,840 --> 01:11:00,038
personalized exactly bites so thank you

1440
01:10:57,038 --> 01:11:02,429
know this this this this boat is you

1441
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:06,429
know by now well underway

1442
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:10,078
no taking to the South it's beginning to

1443
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:13,569
head down and out toward the ocean

1444
01:11:10,078 --> 01:11:17,139
proper which is sort of the last stage

1445
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:22,299
of its run until they move around and

1446
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:24,730
then just do the circuit again so you

1447
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:29,260
can see that by now that the tables are

1448
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:33,218
starting to amass some people have sat

1449
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:36,530
down an expectation of entertainment

1450
01:11:33,219 --> 01:11:43,510
that drinks are being brought out to the

1451
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:43,509
tables meals are being ordered you

1452
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:48,229
for the most part of people you know

1453
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:50,750
things are things are occurring as you'd

1454
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:54,948
expect but there is something that is

1455
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:58,340
odd that you see these tables are all

1456
01:11:54,948 --> 01:11:59,899
dragons nope that's fine I thought it

1457
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:02,960
isn't odd like you're going to like

1458
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:05,420
become mushroom people and no I mean I

1459
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,039
know that I'm done passe you say that

1460
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:08,719
you'll be like oh you're in this weird

1461
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,519
place everyone inside out and they're

1462
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,929
all barfing out of their nose and yeah

1463
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,510
yeah everyone's enchanted then you're

1464
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:15,020
like it's just the weird part is no it's

1465
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,369
not like that

1466
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:22,940
and they're trying to eat the people

1467
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:25,460
okay what the game of choice here

1468
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:28,189
appears to be Giants and halflings and

1469
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:30,739
you was good at that and you would think

1470
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:33,529
like that's not that's not what you

1471
01:12:30,738 --> 01:12:35,389
heard in the doone-gate in yeah that's

1472
01:12:33,529 --> 01:12:38,659
considered that's considered more of a

1473
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:42,949
friendly game in favor as the player

1474
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:45,460
over the house oh you know and it

1475
01:12:42,948 --> 01:12:48,229
suggests in other games like volts or

1476
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:50,539
pickpocket these are games that have

1477
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:52,329
progressive that's bigger potential for

1478
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:56,289
loss on the part of the player

1479
01:12:52,329 --> 01:13:00,050
pickpocket especially is a favorite in

1480
01:12:56,289 --> 01:13:04,960
these guilds is it possible that the

1481
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:08,210
second row the grande rollers are doing

1482
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,670
vaults and then the venti rollers are

1483
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:13,189
doing three pockets you didn't see you

1484
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:14,719
didn't see a difference or a designation

1485
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:18,439
if you were led through those areas okay

1486
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:21,109
earlier it's it's it's an interesting

1487
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:23,689
piece of information okay Johnson

1488
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:25,759
halfling as well oh yeah you know how to

1489
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:26,238
do it I don't need a can we get our show

1490
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,110
last night

1491
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:32,569
criminy never without an expansion of

1492
01:13:30,109 --> 01:13:34,429
course allows you we have a high-octane

1493
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:40,448
ride that we need to keep premium fuel

1494
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:44,960
and yeah exactly so so the metaphor

1495
01:13:40,448 --> 01:13:45,898
walks through with his sort of tool is

1496
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,618
Erdman

1497
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:51,929
new and just sort of like just it's like

1498
01:13:49,618 --> 01:13:55,378
like you guys are all still together

1499
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:57,359
necessary spread out oh yeah split the

1500
01:13:55,378 --> 01:14:00,238
party keep an eye on a later fashion all

1501
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,938
right how long are we here till do we

1503
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:07,110
have to adjust the entire crew if

1504
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:10,590
there's a one day cruiser ya know it's

1505
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:12,509
three days immediately they stop at they

1506
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:17,099
sought that docks on the way down okay

1507
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:19,530
okay so what's going on bar but is it

1508
01:14:17,099 --> 01:14:20,969
about time yet it's not time it's not

1509
01:14:19,529 --> 01:14:21,328
time yet all right little later right

1510
01:14:20,969 --> 01:14:24,090
right right

1511
01:14:21,328 --> 01:14:26,599
you know this is when before everything

1512
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:30,119
is set here at the beginning is when

1513
01:14:26,599 --> 01:14:31,469
people try to test the facility in

1514
01:14:30,118 --> 01:14:32,808
various ways I'm going to keep your eyes

1515
01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:37,908
open okay

1516
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:37,909
darn you thank you okay

1517
01:14:38,969 --> 01:14:49,679
you hear a voice louder than a letter

1518
01:14:46,078 --> 01:14:53,878
than a mouth can do and more and more

1519
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:56,939
encompassing it spreads out this is a

1520
01:14:53,878 --> 01:14:59,668
premium mouth tell them okay it spreads

1521
01:14:56,939 --> 01:15:05,668
out and it seems to come from the walls

1522
01:14:59,668 --> 01:15:07,559
if the voice fills the space and then

1523
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:10,378
you know as they begin to speak you can

1524
01:15:07,559 --> 01:15:14,189
see that people's eyes start to turn up

1525
01:15:10,378 --> 01:15:19,878
to the stage and then the first one the

1526
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:24,179
first voice says introducing arch wizard

1527
01:15:19,878 --> 01:15:28,260
numinous primp of the shattered Conclave

1528
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:31,699
and then he emerges from he emerges from

1529
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:34,829
the teleportation circle a little dazed

1530
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:37,888
but then catches his eye

1531
01:15:34,828 --> 01:15:40,969
gets his bearings back raises his arms

1532
01:15:37,889 --> 01:15:40,969
up he looks like them

1533
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:47,248
he's just draped he looks really do this

1534
01:15:44,368 --> 01:15:50,728
was a pile of fabric spacing here Newman

1535
01:15:47,248 --> 01:15:53,998
is perfect for right and the voice says

1536
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:56,430
that the 1200 is called and they want

1537
01:15:53,998 --> 01:16:03,059
their mystical vestments back

1538
01:15:56,430 --> 01:16:05,640
and walnut dyes laughing yeah but he

1539
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:08,820
takes it he takes it in good spirit he

1540
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:11,100
he makes it his way down good

1541
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:14,269
you know fast sort of stuttered steps

1542
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:18,060
down he seems pretty familiar with the

1543
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:20,700
establishment you must be in order to

1544
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:26,190
give the the zip treatment here at the

1545
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:29,729
hoard next is called out barabbas oculus

1546
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:32,039
of the red hive they've been seen

1547
01:16:29,729 --> 01:16:35,729
converting cavorting with a great worm

1548
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:40,109
Vulcan Trix is it real or is she just a

1549
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:44,159
trophy worm and then through the through

1550
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:47,639
the portal comes a beholder Oh sort of

1551
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:52,109
bobbing in midair and then just sort of

1552
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:54,380
silently sweeping down the down the

1553
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:56,939
stairs now looking around sort of bowing

1554
01:16:54,380 --> 01:17:02,039
as much as it can as much as it can

1555
01:16:56,939 --> 01:17:07,079
muster I shock slinking you yeah got a

1556
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:11,069
sink yeah wink out everybody love you

1557
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:18,300
and then the the voice says it's just

1558
01:17:11,069 --> 01:17:23,639
coughs for a moment and just explode off

1559
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:27,570
the returned of the six and then from

1560
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:30,480
the portal come two people or two

1561
01:17:27,569 --> 01:17:33,630
goblins that you may you may have seen

1562
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,819
them before even out front of the drawn

1563
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:38,579
and courtiers

1564
01:17:34,819 --> 01:17:40,949
these are his these are his his chosen

1565
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:44,670
different distinct from the ones that

1566
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:47,819
had operated the caravan raids and then

1567
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:49,079
after these two come out and they check

1568
01:17:47,819 --> 01:17:51,719
the place out they make sure that

1569
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:54,239
there's no one near the no one near the

1570
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:56,579
teleportation circle they sort of glower

1571
01:17:54,239 --> 01:18:00,779
even at the people who are immediately

1572
01:17:56,579 --> 01:18:03,420
surrounding the stage then two more

1573
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:05,359
goblins come out these goblins are

1574
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:12,930
similar to the ones that you had seen

1575
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:16,949
out on the the road to Westbridge they

1576
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:20,369
have their ears pinned with rings tied

1577
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:22,769
behind their head and they come out and

1578
01:18:20,369 --> 01:18:26,159
they look at their fellows their fellows

1579
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:29,910
nod and then split off the returned

1580
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:31,889
emerges behind them but never everyone

1581
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:35,099
else everyone else has a sort of

1582
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:39,720
practiced grandeur about their

1583
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:42,680
intimidation and he just smiles in a way

1584
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:45,690
that makes you feel like you are food

1585
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:51,390
but it's a different approach different

1586
01:18:45,689 --> 01:18:54,509
approach same result right and then he

1587
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:58,850
makes his way down then he as he walks

1588
01:18:54,510 --> 01:19:02,220
out they his fellows occupy a sort of

1589
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:03,570
almost like a flocking behavior he as

1590
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:06,900
soon as he walks forward they sort of

1591
01:19:03,569 --> 01:19:09,509
lock into some cosmic position around

1592
01:19:06,899 --> 01:19:12,329
him that they've assumed in the five of

1593
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:13,800
them go down the stairs and then

1594
01:19:12,329 --> 01:19:19,470
immediately find their way up to the

1595
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:23,940
second level and the last says and the

1596
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:33,329
prize student of audre career Brahma Lu

1597
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:37,289
da and then even as she even as she

1598
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:40,590
emerges from the teleportation circle

1599
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:42,510
first just the loot then the hands on

1600
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:45,630
the loot are already playing even in the

1601
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:48,690
moment before she's appeared she passes

1602
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:52,400
through some veil and now she is in the

1603
01:19:48,689 --> 01:19:54,809
dragon's hoard and the same the same

1604
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:57,329
mystic property that allowed the voices

1605
01:19:54,810 --> 01:20:03,960
to carry is now filling the dragon's

1606
01:19:57,329 --> 01:20:09,059
hoard with performance of a profound and

1607
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:12,000
moving nature transfixed

1608
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:16,850
ah transics look very serious looking

1609
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:19,409
like grimacing but it is like so forced

1610
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:20,010
black conflicting feeling it was like

1611
01:20:19,409 --> 01:20:22,670
candy

1612
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:25,619
really team Bellerophon really sucks

1613
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:27,210
this is a very confusing barn that gives

1614
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:29,340
her a lot of confusing feelings and then

1615
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:31,800
in her hand she's holding her in her

1616
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:34,590
hand but she has her hand in the air

1617
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,079
pocket in the yeah in the document sea

1618
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:38,579
bag as if she's like rifling for

1619
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:40,559
something and then she finds it and it's

1620
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:44,189
the the poem that frog was entering she

1621
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:46,230

1622
01:20:44,189 --> 01:20:48,029
in her hands or in the bag in her hand

1623
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:50,069
but I like just the knowing that she's

1624
01:20:48,029 --> 01:20:53,009
like such as like this can you imagine

1625
01:20:50,069 --> 01:20:55,380
how worried that that paper is now yeah

it more than you realize

1631
01:21:03,569 --> 01:21:09,000
and then so like dinar sees her and then

1632
01:21:06,569 --> 01:21:21,380

01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:31,890
well that has a little crush no I have a

1636
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:34,650
professional interest it but share just

1637
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:36,990
share for you this is I've studied this

1638
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:37,710
yeah yeah this is for you this is a

1639
01:21:36,989 --> 01:21:40,170
different thing

1640
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:41,819
it's less about right now you've heard

1641
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:44,609
this music you're familiar with the

1642
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:47,039
piece you could play it if you

1643
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:48,599
absolutely had to it might not sound

1644
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,479
exactly like this

1645
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,840
not likely yeah um but a lot of it a big

1646
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:58,049
part of it is the lute itself so yours

1647
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:00,600
has a kind of bayonet on it it's

1648
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:02,550
designed to protect it's designed to

1649
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,860
protect you know performers and

1650
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:08,369
travelers on the road it's almost like a

1651
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:11,339
Swiss Army lead in some ways right

1652
01:22:08,369 --> 01:22:14,309
it has different ways of storage but you

1653
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:16,949
know that that you can spend much like

1654
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:19,050
with a regular instrument like in the

1655
01:22:16,949 --> 01:22:22,199
real world you can spend as much as you

1656
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:22,949
want on a war loot yeah like there's no

1657
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:25,349
other

1658
01:22:22,948 --> 01:22:29,759
there's no upper bound for how much you

1659
01:22:25,349 --> 01:22:31,498
can spend and she spent a lot like you

1660
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,030
just you're trying to take it all in

1661
01:22:31,498 --> 01:22:36,748
like you're trying to figure out how

1662
01:22:33,029 --> 01:22:41,248
many ways it opens and the string

1663
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:43,679
material is odd and you are surprised

1664
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:48,630
that she can play it without cutting her

1665
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:52,170
own hands off like it is a it is a it is

1666
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:56,130
a work of art it makes art and it's also

1667
01:22:52,170 --> 01:23:00,748
a weapon it's one hundred percent of

1668
01:22:56,130 --> 01:23:06,510
spooky town um so yes she is she is

first part of this trip agitation seems

1673
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:19,650
to be at a minimum she's gonna headliner

1674
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:23,819
not an opener yeah she says out loud

1675
01:23:19,649 --> 01:23:25,649

01:27:34,939 --> 01:27:39,439
see that this is because you know things

1754
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:45,618

01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:57,440
little bit closer to break italic

reason one we're very concerned about

1769
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:22,429
the security but also bhrama should be

1770
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:25,039

1771
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:27,319

over for like what you would think the

1778
01:28:43,939 --> 01:28:49,928
skeletal structure can endure and then

1779
01:28:46,609 --> 01:28:54,679
the rest of the body turns towards you

1780
01:28:49,929 --> 01:28:59,029
and then she notices your loo okay she

1781
01:28:54,679 --> 01:29:00,469
seemed mad she saw the loot and then she

1790
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:27,198
introduction she turns to metaphor and

1791
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:31,460

she assesses every cell of your body

1847
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:53,210
this isn't because we're role-playing

1848
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:55,580

1995
01:40:24,389 --> 01:40:29,420
and she's like why like why do you need

1996
01:40:26,488 --> 01:40:33,089
to know where I was incorporated goes

1997
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:34,349
because I don't know what I would do if

1998
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:47,578
something happened to you and I couldn't

1999
01:40:34,349 --> 01:40:49,828
get there well I thought turn around she

2000
01:40:47,578 --> 01:40:52,948
says you went to it town that wasn't on

2001
01:40:49,828 --> 01:40:57,448

2002
01:40:52,948 --> 01:40:59,009
where you were for a while that that was

2003
01:40:57,448 --> 01:41:03,808
something that that was some unfinished

2004
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:06,239
business that I had and then was just

2005
01:41:03,809 --> 01:41:08,369

waves like crashing it's a rocket like

2008
01:41:11,069 --> 01:41:18,599
doesn't make sense and then she's just

2009
01:41:16,229 --> 01:41:21,989
like much of her procreation and she

2010
01:41:18,599 --> 01:41:25,769

2012
01:41:25,769 --> 01:41:31,369
end of the minute so that we get this is

2013
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:34,920
one more okay somewhere she turns to you

2014
01:41:31,368 --> 01:41:37,498
back off of the veranda and she puts her

2015
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:40,800
hand up your back and onto the back of

2016
01:41:37,498 --> 01:41:43,889
your neck and holds it a little tight

2017
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:51,559
mm-hmm and she says what's it like not

2018
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:56,059
to be the tough one pornography phase

2019
01:41:51,559 --> 01:41:58,610
I can do this for another 40 minutes but

2020
01:41:56,059 --> 01:42:00,770
we're going we're going yeah we're not

2021
01:41:58,609 --> 01:42:02,808
asking you don't allow to do this cuz

2022
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:07,780
I'm going so the scope just elect cuts

2023
01:42:02,809 --> 01:42:10,070
out yeah right before the last part is

2024
01:42:07,779 --> 01:42:12,948
how it works you know worse it's like

2025
01:42:10,069 --> 01:42:14,960
she's like this pill boom and then she

2026
01:42:12,948 --> 01:42:18,229
like fall in the door and then it's just

2027
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:19,849
like a pile of these singers like the

2028
01:42:18,229 --> 01:42:23,089
dream is you didn't dream of swing then

2029
01:42:19,849 --> 01:42:26,380
I love I've passed under wave destroys

2030
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:33,920
all the glass I think I hate this whole

2031
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:36,230
but know how to animal and so yeah well

2032
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:39,980
I feel like that worked out about as

2033
01:42:36,229 --> 01:42:42,919
well as it possibly could um so you are

2034
01:42:39,979 --> 01:42:46,129
still doing our job exactly exactly like

2035
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:48,170
the other only one so so you're looking

2036
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:50,840
out over this you're looking out over

2037
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:52,399
this sea of people

2038
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,078
you're occasionally walk out to the base

2039
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:56,899
of the steps take a look at the second

2040
01:42:54,078 --> 01:43:00,198
tier the second tier in the third tier

2041
01:42:56,899 --> 01:43:02,988
have a much stronger their internal

2042
01:43:00,198 --> 01:43:05,569
security is there these extra bodies are

2043
01:43:02,988 --> 01:43:09,439
really just to manage that influx down

2044
01:43:05,569 --> 01:43:15,649
here you know at the layer of people who

2045
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:20,118
are paying these antes right and so as

2046
01:43:15,649 --> 01:43:24,828
you're walking back to the lower floor

2047
01:43:20,118 --> 01:43:29,179
you feel a tap on your shoulder you feel

2048
01:43:24,828 --> 01:43:32,349
sort of like the the tip of a claw you

2049
01:43:29,179 --> 01:43:36,520
turn back and it's melih for with

01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:46,059
so we go over the world are they in the

2144
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:47,199
channel absolutely little bit heaven

2145
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:49,539
image they have been in the channel

2146
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:50,710
before but it's totally worth coming

2147
01:48:49,539 --> 01:48:54,430
back at it

2148
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:56,439
Giants and halflings a more or less

2149
01:48:54,430 --> 01:49:01,150
friendly game sometimes used to resolve

2150
01:48:56,439 --> 01:49:04,649
disputes inexplicably slightly in favor

2151
01:49:01,149 --> 01:49:09,129
of the player the dealer rolls a d-10

2152
01:49:04,649 --> 01:49:10,689
the d-10 is a giant in this metaphor and

2153
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:12,730
the number that they roll on that is

2154
01:49:10,689 --> 01:49:14,429
called the knee that's the target that

2155
01:49:12,729 --> 01:49:19,929
you that the halflings are trying to hit

2156
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:23,230
if the giant rolls a1 players lose the

2157
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:27,070
player then rolls to d6 and they try to

2158
01:49:23,229 --> 01:49:29,739
get the knee or higher if they roll 11

2159
01:49:27,069 --> 01:49:33,159
or 12 they lose automatically that's the

2160
01:49:29,739 --> 01:49:36,429
mall that's the law hey way to go there

2161
01:49:33,159 --> 01:49:40,019
grandma and now the odds are based on

2162
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:42,100
where the knee is set between 1 and 10

2163
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:45,280
on a double 1 roll

2164
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:48,430
that's push right that's a snake scares

2165
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:50,590
with a giant and that's that's basically

2166
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:53,530
it now if you roll the knee exactly

2167
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:56,980
you can split your dice and if you

2168
01:49:53,529 --> 01:50:00,479
double your bed you can get paid a bunch

2169
01:49:56,979 --> 01:50:03,639
of chips like a whole bunch of chips

2170
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:08,709

2248
01:54:01,078 --> 01:54:05,460
theory that when you teleport that you

2249
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:07,288
actually die and then you're recreated

2250
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:08,489
as a simulacrum so like you're not

2251
01:54:07,288 --> 01:54:17,819
really you you're actually someone else

2252
01:54:08,488 --> 01:54:19,319

2253
01:54:17,819 --> 01:54:21,118

before the calm emotion the spill it

2661
02:15:18,849 --> 02:15:22,779
didn't mean they were not agitated I

2662
02:15:21,429 --> 02:15:25,480

are continuing to just hold their

2666
02:15:30,279 --> 02:15:35,738
positions and then as his defenders get

2667
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,170
up and make sure that spook off is okay

02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:02,109
their way away from this group and has

2674
02:16:01,059 --> 02:16:07,570

and I want to get more info out of them

2693
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:54,638
yeah exactly but you're probably feeling

2694
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:56,349
very calm - yeah and I'm up a lot of

2695
02:16:54,638 --> 02:16:57,549
money do you want to do you want to do

2696
02:16:56,349 --> 02:16:57,909
you want to play another round that for

2697
02:16:57,549 --> 02:17:02,199
nothing

2698
02:16:57,909 --> 02:17:03,909
yeah it's okay no problem for more quite

2699
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:05,710
exactly don't worry there'll be an

2700
02:17:03,909 --> 02:17:09,039
opportunity so

2701
02:17:05,709 --> 02:17:12,068
the two of you make your way down

2702
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:14,889
we both hug the shadows yes we've

2703
02:17:12,068 --> 02:17:16,420
exactly well obviously yeah yeah and

2704
02:17:14,888 --> 02:17:18,098
that's that's precisely what that's

2705
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:20,279
precisely what they've done as well I

2706
02:17:18,099 --> 02:17:24,068
mean they're moving around more or less

2707
02:17:20,279 --> 02:17:26,319
like the systems seem to have worked

2708
02:17:24,068 --> 02:17:28,448
pretty well I mean most people were

2709
02:17:26,318 --> 02:17:30,879
looking where they were not and that

2710
02:17:28,449 --> 02:17:32,969
continues to be the case there's

2711
02:17:30,879 --> 02:17:36,188
something about how they're moving

2712
02:17:32,968 --> 02:17:38,318
that makes them incredibly difficult to

2713
02:17:36,189 --> 02:17:40,510
see if you're not actively watching for

2714
02:17:38,318 --> 02:17:42,579
it they're in techniques that I

2715
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:44,679
recognize or am i impressed

2716
02:17:42,579 --> 02:17:46,090
you're definitely impressed but they are

2717
02:17:44,679 --> 02:17:49,478
they're doing what you can do another

2718
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:51,370
way okay but but yes yes I mean this is

2719
02:17:49,478 --> 02:17:54,188
this is you know a way to do this right

2720
02:17:51,370 --> 02:17:59,620
but that's not how they're getting it

2721
02:17:54,189 --> 02:18:03,340
done people you know you learned this

2722
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:05,349
through study and meditation and there

2723
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:10,090
are people who have you know there are

2724
02:18:05,349 --> 02:18:14,079
shortcuts to this oceans artifacts you

2725
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:18,549
know crossroads pacts that sort of thing

2726
02:18:14,079 --> 02:18:20,109
so they are moving down on this main

2727
02:18:18,549 --> 02:18:25,539
floor they are moving along the outer

2728
02:18:20,109 --> 02:18:29,649
edge of it sort of phasing in and out

2729
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:32,859
almost in place the lower the light gets

2730
02:18:29,648 --> 02:18:35,398
the better they are at this and then you

2731
02:18:32,859 --> 02:18:42,010
see them going into the crew quarters

2732
02:18:35,398 --> 02:18:45,689
yeah back pass hmm Oh sounds like

2733
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:53,398
split-off is here to rob this bulb

2734
02:18:45,689 --> 02:18:56,199
that's my father what's wrong yeah okay

2735
02:18:53,398 --> 02:18:58,808
yeah I guess they just say to each other

2736
02:18:56,199 --> 02:19:00,849
now your sister dies but in the movie

2737
02:18:58,808 --> 02:19:03,218
version of this it's like I get always

2738
02:19:00,849 --> 02:19:05,648
doing it right she know if that was good

2739
02:19:03,218 --> 02:19:09,098
thrusting like just like an empty line

2740
02:19:05,648 --> 02:19:14,170
my god use your dial man yeah okay

2741
02:19:09,099 --> 02:19:15,609
okay so we just were to keep following

2742
02:19:14,170 --> 02:19:17,409
oh if you're cool with that I think I

2743
02:19:15,609 --> 02:19:18,189
think so cool about yeah I'm better off

2744
02:19:17,409 --> 02:19:19,870
with you around

2745
02:19:18,189 --> 02:19:22,450
yeah they feel very calm

2746
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:24,840
basically there they're moving back with

2747
02:19:22,450 --> 02:19:27,671
a swiftness alright we are moving with

2748
02:19:24,841 --> 02:19:31,059
unhesitatingly behind them right so now

2749
02:19:27,671 --> 02:19:34,081
they are going through this main

2750
02:19:31,059 --> 02:19:37,689
corridor and they are going to the exit

2751
02:19:34,081 --> 02:19:39,190
that goes down into that shared that

2752
02:19:37,690 --> 02:19:44,260
communal living area near the vault

2753
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:49,810
right okay but the door closes behind

2754
02:19:44,260 --> 02:19:52,060
them and locks oh okay is it one of

2755
02:19:49,810 --> 02:19:53,790
those whispering locks you say word into

2756
02:19:52,060 --> 02:19:56,979
it I have no idea

2757
02:19:53,790 --> 02:20:00,550
yeah you should know there the GL I know

2758
02:19:56,979 --> 02:20:02,319
that but I'm saying you know we don't

2759
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:03,790
know from the P I know exactly you can

2760
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:07,779
go and start talking into the lock if

2761
02:20:03,790 --> 02:20:09,760
you want okay well we see um the door is

2762
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:11,200
really you you actually as you approach

2763
02:20:09,761 --> 02:20:13,659
it you hear the dork sort of click shut

2764
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:16,811
okay um this is the this is the exit

2765
02:20:13,659 --> 02:20:18,581
that goes down now from your tour

2766
02:20:16,810 --> 02:20:20,529
previously right you know that there's

2767
02:20:18,581 --> 02:20:21,700
another way to get down but it was

2768
02:20:20,530 --> 02:20:23,051
always you going to the front of the

2769
02:20:21,700 --> 02:20:24,280
ship and then showing around the front

2770
02:20:23,050 --> 02:20:26,439
way and go through the kitchens

2771
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:28,480
basically this is also the crew living

2772
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:30,700
area where presumably we are living

2773
02:20:28,479 --> 02:20:34,479
right well shouldn't we have access to

2774
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:37,211
this area this this goes down to a boot

2775
02:20:34,479 --> 02:20:39,159
loader isolating areas okay all right I

2776
02:20:37,210 --> 02:20:42,251
guess quick quick I've got the I got the

2777
02:20:39,159 --> 02:20:44,620
route here but we got to go we got to

2778
02:20:42,251 --> 02:20:47,229
run back to the stage behind to the

2779
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:48,430
kitchen through the service quarters did

2780
02:20:47,229 --> 02:20:51,310
you check to see if it was locked like

2781
02:20:48,431 --> 02:20:53,110
did you touch it not I didn't maybe but

2782
02:20:51,310 --> 02:20:56,649
it sounded locked anything I don't what

2783
02:20:53,110 --> 02:20:58,931
oh okay yeah yeah we could just try to

2784
02:20:56,649 --> 02:21:01,239
whisper non going into the key we might

2785
02:20:58,931 --> 02:21:03,251
yeah I hate my job oh yeah I'd be a more

2786
02:21:01,239 --> 02:21:06,220
effective use of our time so down to the

2787
02:21:03,251 --> 02:21:09,521
area with the big column and then into

2788
02:21:06,220 --> 02:21:11,890
the crew living area is where we are

2789
02:21:09,521 --> 02:21:13,480
exactly so you so you peel around you

2790
02:21:11,890 --> 02:21:15,069
you're not able just before you were

2791
02:21:13,479 --> 02:21:19,800
able to sort of track and trace them

2792
02:21:15,069 --> 02:21:22,779
from place to place right this time

2793
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:24,581
you're not able to find them they have

2794
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:26,081
there they're open sort of communal

2795
02:21:24,581 --> 02:21:29,921
living area that is around their vault

2796
02:21:26,081 --> 02:21:32,829
right but you notice something down here

2797
02:21:29,921 --> 02:21:34,859
that you didn't notice previously

2798
02:21:32,829 --> 02:21:37,840
when you first came through before the

2799
02:21:34,859 --> 02:21:41,170
casino was in operation before the Horde

2800
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:45,930
had begun to move downriver there is a

2801
02:21:41,170 --> 02:21:49,239
central column that exists between the

2802
02:21:45,930 --> 02:21:53,710
area where the waiters where the

2803
02:21:49,239 --> 02:21:57,340
waitstaff wait and the galley and end

2804
02:21:53,709 --> 02:22:00,129
the communal living area and from that

2805
02:21:57,340 --> 02:22:03,010
central column you don't it's a

2806
02:22:00,129 --> 02:22:06,728
basically a featureless surface but you

2807
02:22:03,010 --> 02:22:10,960
can see a rectangle in sort of like

2808
02:22:06,728 --> 02:22:15,489
carved into the structure facing the

2809
02:22:10,959 --> 02:22:17,589
vault and from that from that rectangle

2810
02:22:15,489 --> 02:22:21,398
from that sort of like door or portal

2811
02:22:17,590 --> 02:22:25,600
shape you see shadow just billowing out

2812
02:22:21,398 --> 02:22:29,590
like smoke and all we have time not this

2813
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:30,430
game and I mean shadow council mayor

2814
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:34,239
labor Spanky

2815
02:22:30,430 --> 02:22:35,559
it is time for our next break we're

2816
02:22:34,239 --> 02:22:38,439
going to go take full advantage of the

2817
02:22:35,559 --> 02:22:41,199
facilities we will come back and feast
