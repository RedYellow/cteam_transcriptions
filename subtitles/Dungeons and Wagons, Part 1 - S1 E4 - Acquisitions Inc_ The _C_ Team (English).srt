00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,879
JERRY: Hello. I am Tycho Brahe of Penny Arcade and PAX.

2
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,840
JERRY: (shouting) Shut up! RYAN: (snorts of laughter)

3
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,000
(laughing) I am Tycho Brahe of Penny Arcade and PAX,

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,300
I'm also Ominifis Hereward Dran of Acquisitions Incorporated.

5
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,719
But today I am Jerry Holkins, and I'm here to run a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons for my friends!

6
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,980
To my right!

7
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,639
We have the dragonborn narcissist...

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,699
Donaar Blit'zen.

9
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,019
RYAN: (clapping) KATE: That's an opinion.

10
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,579
RYAN: (clapping)

11
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,519
RYAN/KATE: (clapping)

12
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,519
JERRY: The self clap.

13
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,640
JERRY: Don't encourage this. KRIS: That was for your character.

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,579
KRIS: Not for yourself. Which is good. RYAN: Yeah.

15
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,780
KRIS: We like the character. RYAN: Yeah.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,480
JERRY: Amy the Falcon... RYAN: Hate Ryan.

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,400
JERRY: maintaining... KATE: Oh god. Those guns.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,300
AMY: (straining) I'm working out.

19
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,239
JERRY: maintaining the druid character, week after week.

20
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,159
Support you 100% in that.

21
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,259
AMY: Thank you. I appreciate it.  JERRY: Walnut Dankgrass.

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,000
RYAN: Fix your microphone. JERRY: Fix my what?

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,300
KRIS: Top your mic. RYAN: Yeah. Stop flexing.

24
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,840
KATE: Pop that mic out. Flash a little chest! AMY: You're introducing the most important people.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,760
KRIS: You're too strong. RYAN: You need a V.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,880
JERRY: How's this? RYAN: Get that V.

27
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,439
JERRY: Is this the right way? KRIS: Back to one! Everybody back to one.

28
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
JERRY: How's this, Laura QQ? Laura QQ, does that...

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,760
RYAN: Should we start over?

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,000
JERRY: I fixed the microphone. I may call for an air-horn later.

31
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,959
JERRY: What?

32
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,619
KRIS: What the heck guys? All right vamp.

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,359
Ryan, some of that classic jokes. Give us that heat.

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,519
RYAN: Ah... What's the deal with airline peanuts? Am I right?

35
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,120
Who are they trying to keep out of those things?

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,439
KATE: That's true. RYAN: It's like-- How much time I got left?

37
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,639
(laughter)

38
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,059
KRIS: That is not funny! Have you seen the news lately? Oh my god...

39
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,580
JERRY: What do you think, QQ?

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,000
JERRY: Is it sort of like a person talking now? Right. KATE: It sounds good, folks!

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,300
JERRY: Still Ryan. Still Amy. All right.

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,600
KATE: How about me? JERRY: You are Kate Welch.

43
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,239
KATE: That's true. That's me. JERRY: Not your grandma's grandma. Rosie Beestinger.

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,620
JERRY: We have K'thriss Drow'b.

45
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,879
OC, deepest, darkest part of the diary, character insert.

46
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,900
KRIS: Yes. No one can know, except everyone. JERRY: Exactly. Yeah-- (laughs)

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,920
JERRY: That's the optimal scenario.  KRIS: It's very public.

48
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,599
JERRY: We are back at it again, folks.

49
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,759
When last we saw our heroes...

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,000
they had just received their official license to operate

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,219
with exclusive domain in the whole of the Dessarin Valley.

52
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,480
You got the impression from the proprietor of the Dran &amp; Courtier

53
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:15,000
that it has been quite a while since there was a chapter of AcqInc operated out of this inn.

54
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,520
And there may be a particular purpose for that.

55
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,280
You were not able to get much more information,

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,199
even though you tried to (muffled) go the Mom route.

57
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,059
You were not able to get all the way into those protective plates.

58
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,400
You decided your roles.

59
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,479
We have Donaar Blit'zen is our Decisionist, after some wrassling--

60
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,599
RYAN: Leader. The leader.  JERRY: Leader, okay.

61
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:44,039
JERRY: Walnut Dankgrass is our... AMY: Documancer.

62
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,939
JERRY: Documancer, right.

63
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,419
JERRY: Rosie Beestinger. KATE: Cartographer.

64
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,839
JERRY: Cartographer.

65
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,359
Goes along with your astronomical fascinations.

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,840
KATE: I make all kinds of maps, Jerry.  JERRY: That's right. That's right.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
JERRY: Skies, and the land below.

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,860
We have K'thriss Drow'b is the Hoardsperson.

69
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,120
KRIS: I am the Hoardsperson.

70
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,700
JERRY: Yeah. So it is your task to secure supplies for journeys,

71
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,279
also to keep track of the wealth that you generate.

72
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,319
And then ultimately...

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,259
to sort of push those funds in ways that will improve the franchise...

74
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:29,300
mechanically and narratively here in the Dran &amp; Courtier.

75
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,560
KATE: I trust you completely.

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
JERRY: You shouldn't.

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,740
JERRY: We spoke at length over the weekend.  KATE: Shit...

78
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,400
JERRY: He's like literally the worst person for this job. KRIS: No, no, no. He's a changed drow.

79
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,419
RYAN: We're all in the wrong roles.

80
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,220
KATE: Not me! RYAN: Which is the best. No, you're in the wrongest.

81
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,360
AMY: I want to believe that you look at everything we get and you go,

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,960
Does this have to do with my dark lord? Nope! Right in the garbage.

83
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,939
KRIS: That's very important to K'thriss.  KATE: Just over the shoulder.

84
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,000
JERRY: Just straight into some crevasse. Infinite crevasse.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,899
KRIS: Yeah. AMY: It's true.

86
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,019
JERRY: But as you recall, Walnut Dankgrass,

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,720
there were two job scrolls inside your official pack.

88
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,220
AMY: There were. JERRY: That it is your task to cart hither and yon.

89
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,080
AMY: Mm-hmm.

90
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,159
JERRY: And the mission that you decided to take,

91
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,780
without revealing, necessarily, the rest of the information to your fellows,

92
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,579
was a job from one Lord Vizgig Cartinwheel.

93
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,039
AMY: Right. JERRY: Sent directly to the Head Office.

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,460
JERRY: The payment will also be sent there and your cut will be sent to the Dran &amp; Courtier.

95
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,360
This task is called, The Raiding Must Cease.

96
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:41,680
And it describes a rash of cart raids between Stone Bridge and Beliard.

97
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,720
Which is a region sort of to the northeast of Red Larch.

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
AMY: Okay.

99
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,900
JERRY: You have to take a-- You go straight up the Long Road which Red Larch is on.

100
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:55,179
Take a right on the Stone Road.

101
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,020
It's going to be the trip.

102
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,120
But, part and parcel of this job--

103
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,279
Indeed, one of the reasons that you probably took it,

104
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,819
was because it includes partial payment in the form of a cart.

105
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,620
And there is even a coupon...

106
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,340
AMY: Sure.

107
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:21,079
JERRY: included in the document that says, Waelvur's Wagonworks.

108
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,139
And then it specifically says,

109
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,740
Not Thelorn's Safe Journeys.

110
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,060
JERRY: And this is underlined several times. AMY: Right.

111
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,139
JERRY: And then below that it says, Prince and Princess.

112
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,740
And you had heard it was not far from the Dran &amp; Courtier.

113
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,519
Right across the main road that goes north-south through town.

114
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,979
Which becomes on either side the Long Road.

115
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,039
And when we shut our adventure down last time--

116
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,379
AMY: This is the part I was waiting for.  JERRY: Yeah.

117
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:56,219
JERRY: You were looking across the street and you saw a place from which

118
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,520
you would not purchase any of the products that they had necessarily on display.

119
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,219
And that was where we left off.

120
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,540
Now it is time for you to take the reins!

121
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,100
And let's see what happens next.

122
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,500
AMY: I'm hoping they keep the good ones in the back, and they keep the junk...

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,040
AMY: The ones for the adventurers... KRIS: Yeah.

124
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,760
AMY: they keep it behind the desk. KRIS: It's the consumer stuff in the window.

125
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,699
KRIS: Prosumer... JERRY: You want the prosumer-- It's got the big lens...

126
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,719
KRIS: Oh yeah. It's got wheels.

127
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,699
JERRY: Everywhere.

128
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:33,659
AMY: All right, so let's walk on in and inquire about Mr. Vizgig Cartinwheel.

129
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:39,920
JERRY: All right, well as you approach Waelvur's Wagonworks,

130
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,199
there's a sequence of-- sort of like an old trainyard.

131
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,180
There is a sequence of buildings in sort of a semicircle

132
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,579
behind the main open area where carts can roll in and out.

133
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,479
AMY: Gotcha.

134
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,520
JERRY: Basically, you think they must dismantle or re-mantle, for lack or a better term, the carts back there.

135
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,879
And as you approach, you see... a decent cart...

136
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,120
AMY: Mmm...

137
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:17,419
JERRY: emerging from one of these cart stables in the back.

138
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,699
Roll out in that turnabout in the front,

139
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,179
and then come to rest there at the entrance to the facility.

140
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,180
AMY: Well this is good news that the carts work. I've been thinking about it all week.

141
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,440
And I was wondering, do they even roll?

142
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,480
KRIS: That's the one they roll out anytime somebody walks in. Like they're all like this one.

143
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,039
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: The model home cart.

144
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,279
AMY: Exactly. Exactly. JERRY: They're all at least this good.

145
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,419
AMY: Okay, so let's find somebody that's in charge.

146
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,720
Do we see anybody that looks like they work there?

147
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:59,019
JERRY: When this thing rolls out, three or four children, maybe 11 to 13, run out. Begin polishing the wheels...

148
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,539
AMY: Good, shine it up good for us kids.

149
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:02,839
JERRY: Exactly, exactly,

150
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,200
Behind that, there is a small dry fountain in the center of this.

151
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,439
And then just beyond that you think must be the sales floor.

152
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,120
There's basically just a very simple opening in this shack,

153
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,460
that sort of stands out in front of the half circle.

154
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,840
AMY: Okay, great.

155
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,180
Well, I motion everybody like....

156
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,899
AMY: Do we want to... get to it? KRIS: Yeah, absolutely.

157
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,860
AMY: Okay. I didn't know if we wanted to do any backtalking like,

158
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,539
Hey so what's the deal with these carts?

159
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,779
AMY: Do we want this? Do we want to do this? JERRY: This cart sucks!

160
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,100
RYAN: Well once we talk to someone, I want to establish specifically what cart we get ahead of time.

161
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
AMY: Oh okay, sure, sure, sure. KRIS: Yeah. I don't want to get my heart set on it.

162
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,560
RYAN: Yeah. I want the blue one.  KATE: The Prince and Princess cart sounds promising.

163
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,919
AMY: It's true. KATE: Could be a really nice cart.

164
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,120
AMY: Could also be a lemon. All right. Well let's go inside towards the sales floor.

165
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,139
JERRY: Absolutely. You approach the window.

166
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:59,239
It has a sign. Just above it says "Waelvur's."

167
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,360
W-A-E-L-V-R-S, for those who like to write notes.

168
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,399
And you see a man set down a blacksmith's hammer

169
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,120
and then wipe his hands on a rag as you approach.

170
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,539
AMY: Mm-hmm. Okay. Great.

171
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,139
For someone who takes notes, this isn't the one they said not to go to, right?

172
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,840
KATE: No, that one is Thelorn's. AMY: Thank you.

173
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,000
KATE: I have this listed as a positive quality of Waelvur's,

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,340
Not Thelorn's.

175
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,340
KATE: And I underlined it a lot. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Okay. JERRY: Kate! Excuse me.

176
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,740
JERRY: Rosie! AMY: That's why I looked directly at you.

177
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,379
AMY: I'm like, I know you've got my back on this. Thanks.

178
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:37,939
JERRY: Rosie Beestinger.

179
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,780
AMY: Okay. Yeah let's walk up holding the missive.  JERRY: The coupon?

180
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,799
AMY: Yeah. Now let me ask you, wait--

181
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,120
Quick question for going forward.

182
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,779
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.  AMY: Did he name it, The Raiding Must Cease?

183
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:53,600
AMY: Or is that for like... metagame that we know it?

184
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,980
JERRY: The Raiding Must Cease is literally the name of the job that came into the Head Office.

185
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,840
AMY: All right, so I want to walk in and I want to say,

186
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,440
We're here about the raiding that has to cease, and we're here to cease it.

187
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,940
KRIS: We're not here to do the raiding.

188
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,860
KRIS: We're here regarding... raiding. RYAN: Should we ask for Vizgig?

189
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,460
KATE: We will end the raiding.

190
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,440
AMY: Well, I'm assuming he'll tell me where it is. RYAN: Just kick the door in and just be like...

191
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,540
KRIS: Take me to your finest Vizgig.

192
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,759
AMY: Sure.  JERRY: He reaches his hand out and...

193
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,780
AMY: I do not hand it over, but I open it for him to see it.

194
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:26,559
JERRY: All right.

195
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,320
Gets down and looks close. Because the coupon portion is near the bottom there. Says...

196
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,080
"Prince and Princess?"

197
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,559
AMY: That's what it says.

198
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,879
KATE: You better believe it.

199
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,679
JERRY: "(scoffs)"

200
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,639
JERRY: "All right, well no, it's-- That's... You'll-- Yeah, It's good."

201
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,899
AMY: Okay... KATE: See? Sounds good.

202
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,179
AMY: Hmm.

203
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,560
JERRY: As you turn around, you see that cart drive away and then head north through town.

204
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,680
You can see him leave, now there's just this dark rectangle inside this shack.

205
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,120
And a cart...

206
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,720
If there is a point-- Imagine a continuum...

207
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:15,699
where you have a cart, and not a cart.

208
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,639
Imagine that there is a point just past not a cart.

209
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,100
Imagine that there is, over here in this, where if anything happened to it,

210
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,040
It would be just as bad as not having a cart.

211
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,440
That is the cart that is wheeled out in front.

212
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:41,279
And the exhausted beast that is pulling it...

213
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,039
is clearly in the midst of some kind of existential crisis.

214
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,200
Two boys are steadily encouraging it out to the round with a rubbery carrot.

215
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,279
AMY: Mmm... great. Love that.

216
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Okay. Well...

217
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,379
KATE: Never look a gift cart in the mouth.

218
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,139
KATE: That's what I always say. AMY: Never look a gift cart in the mouth.

219
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,419
KRIS: She's a beaut. RYAN: I don't get it.

220
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,799
KATE: She's a beautiful... I'll tell you when you're older.

221
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,000
RYAN: All right. KATE: All right!

222
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,700
AMY: I look at Donaar and I go... RYAN: Like a day?

223
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,139
AMY: Do we think this is the best cart we can get?

224
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,559
Like, as an aside,

225
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,460
Do we think we can negotiate anything better?

226
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,320
RYAN: Oh, I'm not doing this job for that cart.

227
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,119
KRIS: I think what we should... RYAN: I say that.

228
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,620
KRIS: Well, maybe what we can do is do the work, and then impress them.

229
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,000
And once they see that... they'll be, you know, so thankful...

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,360
KATE: That's an adorable idea.

231
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,440
KATE: Why don't I try-- RYAN: This will look good on our portfolio?

232
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,440
KATE: Why don't I try a little Rosie Beestinger charm on this guy.

233
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,840
JERRY: You're going to sting it a little bit? All right.

234
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,639
KATE: I'm going to sting it, I'm going to sting it. Okay. AMY: Absolutely.

235
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,919
RYAN: Who are we charming? Are we even... JERRY: Going to charm the horse!

236
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,439
RYAN: Are you charming the cart itself? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Be healthier! KATE: I'm going to charm...

237
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,160
KATE: Monsieur Waelvur himself, if I have to.

238
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:58,939
RYAN: Oh.

239
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,620
JERRY: Tell me what you're doing.

240
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,019
KATE: I'm going to lean heavily on my quarterstaff, I lean oh so heavily.

241
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,960
JERRY: Like, too heavily. KATE: So heavily.

242
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,740
KATE: I only weigh 28 lbs, but somehow--

243
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,279
KATE: I'm exerting at least 200 lbs of force on this thing. JERRY: It's a seismic event.

244
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,579
KATE: (grunts)

245
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,120
Sir.

246
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:22,139
You wouldn't make an old woman ride in something like that, would you?

247
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,220
JERRY: Lets see some dice here, kid.  KATE: All right.

248
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,759
AMY: What do you got?

249
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,019
KATE: Is this intimidation? Am I intimidating you with my old age or is this just a charisma?

250
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,819
KRIS: Persuasion. KATE: Persuasion.

251
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,340
JERRY: Yeah, this is "persuage", and I'm going to apply disadvantage to this roll.

252
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,160
KRIS: Dang, son! KATE: You're a turd man.

253
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,939
JERRY: I'm a Dungeon Master.

254
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,740
KATE: Okay well that's a 17 plus two so that's a 19.

255
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,220
JERRY: Yeah, that's a good roll. AMY: But...

256
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,899
KATE: And that's a three plus two. JERRY: That's five.

257
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:50,059
KATE: That's not as good as a 19.

258
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,959
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: For those keeping track at home.

259
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,200
JERRY: He says...

260
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,840
"If you had tried that on my father..."

261
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,179
"it might have worked."

262
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,800
KATE: I like the sound of him.

263
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,959
(laughter)

264
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,060
RYAN: Yeah, have we like asked this guy's name? KATE: Where's he at?

265
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,319
RYAN: Are we making a lot of assumptions? This guy just came out with an oily rag and we're like...

266
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,860
RYAN: persuading him? KRIS: He does work here.

267
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,980
JERRY: As a mechanic! JERRY: You just persuade anybody who has a rag.

268
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,820
AMY: He brought out the cart. KATE: It's Red Larch!

269
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,300
KATE: If his name's Waelvur's Wagonworks, he's probably Waelvur.

270
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:22,319
KRIS: He's got a name tag. RYAN: Does he have a name tag?

271
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,160
AMY: You can ask him. Ask him.  KATE: You ask him.

272
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:29,039
RYAN: Dude, are you the one who sent this? Fella?

273
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:38,240
JERRY: "We are contracted with Lord Vizgig Cartinwheel to offer our renowned Prince and Princess package."

274
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,080
"As part and parcel of jobs that he occasionally sends out to adventurers."

275
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,700
JERRY: "Adventurers like yourself."

276
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,700
RYAN: I'm a prince. JERRY: "Adventurers I am profoundly exhausted by."

277
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,719
RYAN: I'm a prince. And this is not princely, my friend.

278
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,100
KRIS: Yeah, we came here for a reward that's part and parcel, not a cart that's partial.

279
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,979
AMY: (gasps) Oh! KATE: Whoa!

280
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,519
AMY: Oh, write that down! Good stuff from the episode!

281
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,820
JERRY: He looks back at the cart, back at the horse, at you, and says,

282
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,379
"I don't know..."

283
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,080
JERRY: "See a resemblance." RYAN: Oh. Oh, all right!

284
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,440
KATE: Wow, he just called you busted! RYAN: Oh. You called me an old horse? Ugh.

285
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,879
RYAN: All right, I'm going to intimidate this guy.  KATE: Yes!

286
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,080
RYAN: I'm going to intimidate the crap out of him.

287
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,080
KATE: Rosie silently fist pumps. RYAN: I'm going to get all in his face.

288
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,240
JERRY: Cool, enjoy a disadvantage roll.  AMY: Wish I had guidance.

289
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,779
RYAN: So if you say that before I say advantage? JERRY: Yes, exactly.

290
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:36,639
KATE: He really wants us to have this shitty cart.

291
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,480
AMY: He's got so many disadvantages.

292
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,860
JERRY: This is Dungeons &amp; Dragons. There's all kinds of ways for you guys to live.

293
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,960
RYAN: Yeah by rolling two 20s, my friend.  JERRY: Yeah double 20s.

294
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,860
JERRY: I'm going to roll 40, you piece of shit!

295
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,139
RYAN: 11 plus 5 or...

296
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,399
KRIS: You got a hot...Oh, you got intimidate.  RYAN: Nine plus five.

297
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,659
JERRY: So 14? RYAN: 14.

298
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,800
JERRY: No... RYAN: (scoff)

299
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,699
KATE: (scoff) JERRY: No. I mean...

300
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,820
RYAN: So I get all up in his face and I say...

301
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,819
RYAN: Listen, oil rag, get me a better frigging cart!

302
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,799
JERRY: If he could get another rag out,

303
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,799
and then wipe off another set of hands at this point, he would.

304
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,120
Like I think that this has happened before,

305
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,000
and I think that he is familiar with the kind of game

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,039
that upstart adventures operate in this context.

307
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,379
RYAN: Dungeons &amp; Dragons?

308
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,000
KRIS: Could we talk to your father please?

309
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,539
KATE: I like the sound of him.

310
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:40,759
KRIS: I'm not rolling for that. It's just what I say.

311
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,440
JERRY: "I don't know where he is."

312
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,880
KRIS: Oh. AMY: Can I attempt to Charm Person at this point?

313
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,900
JERRY: Yeah.  AMY: Hmm.

314
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,000
AMY: So we're not fighting, so he does not get advantage.

315
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,240
KRIS: Ever...

316
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,339
AMY: If he fails a wisdom saving throw, you are charmed by me.

317
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:04,720
JERRY: You are hereby charmed by me! AMY: Be charmed by me, damn it!

318
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:09,259
JERRY: And not Walnut Dankgrass, I mean charmed by Amy the Falcon!

319
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,220
AMY: That's me. KRIS: (soaring hawk sounds)

320
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,019
JERRY: Wisdom save?

321
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:13,879
AMY: Yes. RYAN: Turn into a bear. That'll scare him.

322
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,760
JERRY: What's your spell DC? AMY: What is my spell DC...

323
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,980
JERRY: (singing) Spell DC!

324
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:20,899
AMY: 13. JERRY: K.

325
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:23,599
KATE: Don't you win this roll.

326
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,519
KRIS: Boy. He's going to be so mad--

327
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,119
KRIS: when he finds out he's been charmed. JERRY: No, he's charmed. &gt;&gt; KATE: He's charmed!

328
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,579
AMY: He's charmed? KATE: He's charmed!

329
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,500
AMY: Oh no, what a tragedy.

330
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,380
JERRY: So he cannot attack you, that's true.

331
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,940
RYAN: We're safe!

332
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,620
AMY: Well no, now we can get him to-- JERRY: Is he more afraid of you than his father, I guess.

333
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:42,839
AMY: That's what I want to know. Okay, so.

334
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Now that we've done that, and he cannot attack me...

335
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,519
KRIS: I was very concerned.

336
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,839
AMY: Hang on, hang on. He regards us as a friendly acquaintance, though.

337
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,959
JERRY: That's right. Yeah, yeah.  AMY: So we've bought some favor with him.

338
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,759
AMY: It's not just practical.

339
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,019
Okay and at this point I would...

340
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,440
I mean I guess we're all out of persuasion checks, but I'll try it...

341
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:06,259
KRIS: I've got a really good persuasion check. AMY: Oh yeah, lets do it. K'thriss.

342
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,519
KRIS: What would you-- What's the best-- What are we trying to accomplish here?

343
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,960
AMY: All right. I pull you aside and I'm like... RYAN: Better reward, right?

344
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,279
AMY: Listen, buddy. This cart is just not going to get us where we need to go.

345
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,940
Just see if you can sweeten the deal. Anything. Better horse...

346
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,140
KRIS: Okay, let me make a persuasion attempt of my own.

347
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,540
JERRY: Okay. KRIS: All right, here we go...

348
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:29,839
KRIS: I'm going to take advantage. Are you going to disadvantage me on this one?

349
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,459
JERRY: I could. &gt;&gt; KATE: Don't do it. KRIS: You beast!

350
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,980
KRIS: You know what? I'm going to burn my advantage.

351
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,539
JERRY: Okay, all right. KRIS: Take that!

352
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,060
KRIS: Wind it back.

353
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:40,519
All right, so we got a-- that was a 16.

354
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:43,079
And that was a 19!

355
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,639
JERRY: Okay. Now what is the case you are trying to make?

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,539
KATE: Let's see some roleplay. JERRY: Keeping in mind that this is--

357
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:49,480
JERRY: I mean, you're looking around like...

358
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,059
You don't actually know how far the needle bends here.

359
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,879
But you suspect that with your oratory,

360
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,300
you might be able to maximize this scenario.

361
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,620
KRIS: Friend.

362
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,220
I travel with three very sick people in my charge.

363
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,600
KRIS: We have an infirm woman. AMY/KATE: (coughs)

364
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,000
KRIS: And... RYAN: I cough up some acid. (gagging sounds)

365
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,500
KRIS: And a reasonably disgusting dragon man.

366
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,400
And we don't know what her problem is yet!

367
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,560
KRIS: Science! Cannot describe it. RYAN: Lot of guesses. We got a lot of guesses.

368
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,200
JERRY: It's something we talk about a lot. RYAN: Yeah!

369
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,660
KRIS: It's a syndrome. Multiple things.

370
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,480
KRIS: But no cause. JERRY: She's at the crossroads of disease.

371
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,339
KRIS: Right. RYAN: Yeah.

372
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:38,299
KRIS: And I'm afraid that giving us this cart in exchange for the work we're going to do to you

373
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,559
would be like a triple murder.

374
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,399
JERRY: He's like, "Well the job-- the job's not from me."

375
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,900
"If..."

376
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,519
"Do I look like a lord to you?"

377
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,560
KRIS: Where's the lord that we--

378
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,220
We showed you the paper.

379
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,460
We just want to do the work and allow you continue with yours.

380
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,740
JERRY: "Here. Show me the paper."

381
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,160
KRIS: I don't have it, but--

382
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,279
AMY: I'll show it again.

383
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,279
JERRY: "Here, just-- just--"

384
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,720
AMY: Don't. JERRY: "No, no. It's like-- Come on."

385
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,819
AMY: Don't touch it. JERRY: "No, we're--"

386
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:06,759
RYAN: You charmed him already.

387
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,599
JERRY: "Yeah, yeah. We're--" KATE: We're good.

388
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,119
JERRY: "Yeah." AMY: Okay. I very begrudgingly hand it over.

389
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,839
JERRY: "You're new here. Just let me take a look."

390
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,299
He looks over and he says, "This..."

391
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,479
"This job went to your employer."

392
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,900
"From someone who employs us."

393
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,819
"We're both being crushed beneath the boot here."

394
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:29,959
KATE: Bureaucracy. RYAN: Yeah.

395
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,480
KATE: Subcontract. RYAN: We need to seize the means of production.

396
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,759
JERRY: "You and I are down here in this situation."

397
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,760
"We're both being manipulated."

398
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,899
KRIS: Hmm.

399
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,160
JERRY: "That being said..." KRIS: Roll to explain...

400
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,580
KATE: Still-- (cough) still need a cart. RYAN: Yeah.

401
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,439
KATE: (coughs) That's better than this one. JERRY: "That being said..."

402
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:50,539
JERRY: "that's the cart I have."

403
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,100
AMY: Hmm. KRIS: Hmm.

404
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:52,980
JERRY: "But..."

405
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,320
"I might be able to do something about the horse."

406
00:21:57,779 --> 00:21:58,839
KATE: Nice.

407
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,759
AMY: Put him out of its misery? KRIS: You should. Yeah.

408
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,559
KATE: Wow. (laughs)

409
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
KRIS: I am hungry.

410
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,259
KATE: Zero tolerance policy for shitty horses from Walnut.

411
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:14,779
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. All this does is it continues Walnut's aggressive policy against animals.

412
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:15,480
KATE: Yep. RYAN: Yeah.

413
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,539
KATE: Very anti-animal. JERRY: That manifests itself in each game!

414
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:23,240
AMY: I just wanted to play a druid so I can murder as many fantastical creatures as I--

415
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,099
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. It's like the opposite...

416
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:27,339
KATE: Squirrels. Eagles. JERRY: of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

417
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,160
KRIS: It's garbage. Yeah. JERRY: So it's like this...

418
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,120
JERRY: He whistles.

419
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:38,339
You see another point cloud of these small boys emerge from wherever they emerge from.

420
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:47,440
They would now decouple this still objectively bad horse.

421
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,240
KRIS: Yeah.

422
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:58,420
JERRY: Wheeling back around behind, they pull out a marginally less angry and disappointing horse.

423
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,940
KRIS: Now we're talking. AMY: What color is it?

424
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,299
JERRY: It's black. AMY: K.

425
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,799
AMY: Interesting. JERRY: What?

426
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,120
KRIS: I guess-- JERRY: Laura QQ, why don't you come and do it?

427
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,659
AMY: We'll cut it out. JERRY: No, no. It's because you're a pro,

428
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,480
JERRY: you do this shit all the time. KATE: (singing) Laura QQ...

429
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,599
RYAN: We'll fix it in post. KATE: (singing) Fixing the mic.

430
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:19,219
KRIS: It's like pressed into the part that you do shots out of, when you're in... You know what I mean?

431
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,319
RYAN: The belly button? KRIS: This little hole here.

432
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,779
KATE: Wow. KRIS: Vampires like eat that.

433
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,420
RYAN: You do shots out of here?

434
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,000
KATE: Vampires eat this. KRIS: Yeah, if you're a vampire.

435
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
AMY: The vampire shot glass.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,319
RYAN: (laughing) What are you talking about?

437
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,200
JERRY: What did I miss?

438
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,819
KRIS: Sorry. AMY: Anatomy. Anatomy.

439
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:35,119
RYAN: Yeah. College. KATE: You wouldn't understand.

440
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,219
JERRY: It's fine. This-- AMY: So we got a good horse.

441
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
JERRY: This horse... Well you have a--

442
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,000
KATE: Less bad. JERRY: Better-- Yeah. You have a less bad beast.

443
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,819
AMY: That's fine.

444
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:46,799
RYAN: One to ten. What we talking? JERRY: That has emerged...

445
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,359
JERRY: 3.2. RYAN: Ugh.

446
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,959
KATE: Less bad horse. KRIS: A ten's an okay horse.

447
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
(laughter) KRIS: Still pretty bad.

448
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,160
JERRY: This is a shit horse!

449
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,700
KRIS: That's bad. RYAN: Yeah.

450
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,660
JERRY: This is-- It's like before, that was like not a horse.

451
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,759
Like it couldn't do the things we associate with horses.

452
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,759
This is a "horse" in quotation marks.

453
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,599
AMY: Okay that's fine. RYAN: Okay. Like a piñata.

454
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,419
JERRY: Yeah exactly. But yeah, don't test that theory!

455
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,200
KRIS: It's like a "horse-style" pull creature.

456
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,019
(laughter)

457
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,920
JERRY: "Horse-style?" KATE: Horse-product.

458
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,360
KRIS: Yeah. "Horse-esque." JERRY: It's like "cheese food?"

459
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,439
AMY: Oh my god. All right. RYAN: Horse in a can.

460
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,120
KATE: I want to ask, what's the horse's name?

461
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,340
JERRY: The horse's name is Coriander.

462
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,959
KATE: (whispers) Coriander. RYAN: It's our horse now. We get to name it.

463
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,220
AMY: And we're naming it Coriander.

464
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,220
JERRY: It might not come to-- Yeah.

465
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,000
AMY: It might not live.

466
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,639
JERRY: But the cart itself-- RYAN: Now I'll get real attached.

467
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,380
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, exactly. But the cart itself is still a problem.

468
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,259
But there was no... you know...

469
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:47,160
JERRY: quick judicious play he could make for the cart. KRIS: Yeah. There's no wiggle room.

470
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,540
AMY: That's fine, you got Mending.

471
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,460
JERRY: It's not-- It's ancient.

472
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,579
I mean this is an ancient...

473
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,700
It's like when you put the IKEA shelf together but not quite right.

474
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,600
You missed a couple of those twists.

475
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,619
And so it has sort of a lateral...

476
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,959
KRIS: Yeah. It's got a cant to it.

477
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,779
I'm worried that if I use Mending on it

478
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:09,960
it will turn back into a pile of trash.

479
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,480
AMY: (laughing) Okay that's a good point. KRIS: So I'm not going to Mend it.

480
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,779
AMY: That's a good point.

481
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,099
RYAN: We don't have to take this job.

482
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,279
KRIS: But we do!

483
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,259
JERRY: But that's the situation-- KATE: We get a free cart.

484
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:25,200
JERRY: Yeah exactly. The situation here is that there is a high seat up behind the horse in front.

485
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:28,779
Small brass post to tie off the reins there.

486
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:29,579
AMY: Great.

487
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
JERRY: Sort of a flat roof.

488
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,019
But this is very much a working cart.

489
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:36,900
It's not really meant for transportation, but--

490
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,960
You know what I mean? Like you can sit in the way back.

491
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,079
AMY: Sure. KRIS: Yeah.

492
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,099
AMY: Cool. The pickup truck of carts. JERRY: Yeah, exactly!

493
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:44,000
JERRY: Exactly. You would get in the way back. AMY: Wonderful.

494
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,460
RYAN: El Camino? KATE: Are there windows?

495
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:50,979
JERRY: There are two bar-guarded holes.

496
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,779
AMY: Perfect! KATE: Love it!

497
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,539
JERRY: One on each side. KRIS: The bars are tinted.

498
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:55,619
AMY: (laughing) The bars are tinted...

499
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,099
(laughter)

500
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,359
AMY: I love it. KRIS: With filth!

501
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,940
KATE: Rosie is loving this whip!

502
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,960
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's Rosie's style?

503
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,579
KATE: Yeah! JERRY: Hashtag Rosie's.

504
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:05,379
KATE: She's loving it!

505
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,460
KRIS: So who have we been contracted to if not this wagon establishment?

506
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,100
KATE: Lord Vizgar Wagon--

507
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:13,500
AMY: Vizgig Cartinwheel. KATE: Vizgig Cartinwheel.

508
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,019
KRIS: Does this lord frequent this business? RYAN: Yeah, where's this guy?

509
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,599
KRIS: Where might we find him?

510
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,459
KATE: Well if you'd let me explain to you, it's on the map.

511
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,660
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: There's a map!

512
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,880
KRIS: Why did we come here?

513
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,900
KATE: I'm the Cartographer! JERRY: Goddamn it!

514
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,019
KRIS: You wanted to see this, Cartographer. KATE: Because we get a free cart!

515
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:32,500
KATE: (laughing) It's just replay. We lost ten minutes over and over again.

516
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,399
Okay. Rosie knows the way.

517
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,740
KRIS: Okay. KATE: Whenever you guys are ready to mount up.

518
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,900
JERRY: Oh. New mic? LAURA QQ: Yeah.

519
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,440
JERRY: Here. Oh no, this is... KATE: New mic!

520
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,759
JERRY: This is going to--

521
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,940
AMY: We're going to pause. RYAN: This is the glory of live theater.

522
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,920
KATE: I would like to describe-- JERRY: This is going to be a new tier of intimacy.

523
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,640
AMY: Describe what? KATE: I would like to describe Rosie climbing the cart.

524
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,820
KATE: Slowly.

525
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:52,460
KRIS: (laughing) Oh god. Just sell it. AMY: Like extra slow. &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah.

526
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,960
KRIS: So he doesn't feel bad about his--

527
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,240
KATE: Rosie plants her staff and grunts--

528
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,180
I plant my staff and grunt with satisfaction.

529
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,140
Because I'm very excited about riding a cart.

530
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,620
I am extremely fit for my age. But it's still hard work walking everywhere, you know?

531
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,839
I'm very small and I have this big quarterstaff that I'm hauling around.

532
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,500
And I done a lot of exercise recently, so I'm like,

533
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,220
Ah you know what? Taking a load off sounds really great right now.

534
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:19,919
LAURA QQ: I'll check it.

535
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,380
KATE: And we're done.

536
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,300
KRIS: Wow.

537
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,400
KATE: I didn't get one foot in the cart.

538
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,640
(laughter)

539
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,300
AMY: I was transported, though.

540
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,720
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Thank you, Rosie.

541
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,860
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Theater of the Mind.

542
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,699
RYAN: Yeah. Quite the picture was painted there.

543
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,819
KATE: All right. Rosie gets in the cart.

544
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,599
(laughter)

545
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,559
RYAN: Tl;dr on this?

546
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,980
JERRY: Cool. So in the back?

547
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,980
KATE: Uh... yeah...? JERRY: In the way back?

548
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,860
RYAN: Roof?

549
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,500
KATE: Uh... I don't know. She might want to drive.

550
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,379
AMY: Oh she can drive. KATE: Yeah okay. Rosie's going to drive.

551
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:48,399
AMY: Donaar, I'm sure, wants to sit...

552
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,560
KATE: Do you want to sit up front?

553
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,659
Do you want to sit up front?

554
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,060
KATE: Have you been good enough to sit up front? RYAN: No. I want to be carted around.

555
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,319
KATE: All right. That's true. You're more of a palanquin-type.

556
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,339
Yeah. In the back. Get in the back.

557
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,500
AMY: Palanquin paladin? Hmm. All right.

558
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,099
KATE: (gasps) The palanquin paladin! AMY: It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. I'm sorry.

559
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:07,839
AMY: I'm sorry! Don't give me disadvantage!

560
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,839
KATE: It's very good!

561
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,619
AMY: Yeah, I want to ride on top.

562
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,659
KATE: On the roof? Okay. AMY: Mm-hmm.

563
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,759
KATE: So we got one inside, one on the roof, one on the seat...

564
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,939
You want to just dangle off the back? Or cling to the underbelly?

565
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,820
KRIS: Can I ride the horse?

566
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,200
KATE: Yep! AMY: That's not how it goes.

567
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,680
KATE: It's Dungeons &amp; Dragons, fool!

568
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,779
KRIS: No. Who am I inside with?

569
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,019
KRIS: You're in there? RYAN: Yeah.

570
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:30,519
RYAN: Me and you? &gt;&gt; JERRY: Inside within? KRIS: Sure.

571
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,519
RYAN: Nice. JERRY: Within the cart?

572
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,779
KRIS: Yeah. How much puke do you have on you?

573
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,299
RYAN: Minimal. KRIS: I guess I don't mind it.

574
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,559
RYAN: Yeah. Couple of teaspoons. KATE: What time of day is it?

575
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,460
KATE: Are you comfortable? KRIS: Oh yeah. Good question.

576
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,740
KRIS: I prefer inside. KATE: Okay.

577
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,799
KRIS: But I...

578
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:49,299
If I have to do something where I'm looking at it and it is in full sunlight, that's where I take my disadvantage.

579
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,899
So it's not like I'm being scalded.

580
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,140
JERRY: All-day. KRIS: But I don't do my best work.

581
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,280
KRIS: Yeah. KATE: Okay.

582
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,740
JERRY: So you distributed yourself. KRIS: So I just put the cloak over.

583
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:04,039
JERRY: We have K'thriss and Donaar ensconced inside.

584
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,839
AMY: Nice. JERRY: We have Walnut Dankgrass...

585
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,420
and Rosie Beestinger riding up top.

586
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,560
JERRY: So you're driving, you're shotgun? AMY: She's driving. I'm up top.

587
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,279
KATE: Naw she's just on the roof, I think.

588
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,700
RYAN: Yeah. Just on the roof of it.

589
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,200
JERRY: You're sort of enmeshed in the cargo netting up there.

590
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,299
KATE/AMY: Yeah.

591
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,799
KATE: Where she feels most at home.

592
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,599
AMY: I'm just like, ah. All I can see is sky and not these fools.

593
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,799
JERRY: Yeah. So I'm not even going to-- there's going to be zero roll factor for you.

594
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,680
This is like the most basic sort of thing for you.

595
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:41,600
Quick glance at the map shows you where this stretch of raiding space is happening between Stone Bridge and Beliard.

596
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,759
As I said, you go north, and then you go east.

597
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:52,940
And it really is the first opportunity to do that at a larger scale road.

598
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,220
And then the town itself, of Westbridge,

599
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,799
is really where you do the turning there.

600
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,839
JERRY: So... KATE: Okay.

601
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,920
JERRY: You know exactly, 100%, how to get the party there.

602
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,560
KATE: Nice. JERRY: Easy pease.

603
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:15,119
KATE: I'm telling the horse a story about how my nephew once was in a raiding party and I find it very distasteful.

604
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,500
JERRY: (laughs) Raidism.

605
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,740
KATE: And by god, this raiding will cease.

606
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,640
By the end of this trip, Coriander is sick of hearing me talk.

607
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,280
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: Sick, physically.

608
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:33,119
KATE: (laughing) Coriander barfs three times on the way to Westbridge. KRIS: The horse is now identical to the other horse.

609
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,599
(laughter)

610
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,740
KRIS: Transformed.

611
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,460
JERRY: It just vomited out a second vomit horse.

612
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,160
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: And you move twice as fast.

613
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,940
JERRY: So this is-- None of this is true. KATE: You're welcome.

614
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,600
KATE: You're welcome. KRIS: You're no longer encumbered.

615
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,279
JERRY: I know this is Dungeons &amp; Dragons but there are limitations.

616
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,460
AMY: It's true. Horses don't vomit, they colic. And if they do that they die. Sorry. That's it.

617
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,299
KRIS: Nice! KATE: Wow! Wow, druid.

618
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,179
KATE: All right. So we're now in the town of Westbridge. RYAN: Summon some eagles to cart us around.

619
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:03,100
JERRY: Yeah, you're ready to grab the reins and move this cart north through town.

620
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:05,159
KATE: Okay. Oh! We're not in the town of Westbridge yet.

621
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,019
KATE: But we're going there. Okay. JERRY: No. You have secured your vehicle.

622
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:15,920
JERRY: You get a hearty wave from whoever it was at this place that you talked to.

623
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,940
KATE: Todd Waelvur.

624
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,940
RYAN: Yeah. Never did get his name.

625
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,059
AMY: I did get back the missive, though. RYAN: Oil rag!

626
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,960
KATE: You called him "Oil Rag." Yeah. RYAN: Yeah.

627
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,400
KATE: Grab that missive right back.

628
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,280
RYAN: I say, so long, Oil Rag! AMY: NPC Number 35.

629
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,879
KRIS: That might have coincidently been his name, so... JERRY: Yeah.

630
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,380
RYAN: So do we know where we're going?

631
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,880
KATE: Yes! &gt;&gt; JERRY: 100%. KRIS: Take us.

632
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,920
JERRY: She's got it totally dialled in.

633
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,880
KATE: I don't even have to roll, I'm so good at this.

634
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,920
JERRY: There's literally like one turn. Let's see how it goes.

635
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,720
KATE: All right. We go there.

636
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,120
JERRY: So you pull the cart out straight--

637
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,719
This is the direction that you came from in your family's cart.

638
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,559
You can remember its comforts quite well.

639
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,899
KRIS: Oh boy. KATE: Stark contrast.

640
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,980
JERRY: Exactly. It was only a few days ago.

641
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,899
But that had soft leathers.

642
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,000
There was a nice bottle of silver wine in there.

643
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,419
It was an incredible experience.

644
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,140
It had the fiber optic lights.

645
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,920
RYAN: Yeah. The ground effects.

646
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,560
JERRY: Oh yeah, it was-- KATE: The bass.

647
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,179
JERRY: Oh yeah. It was thumping.

648
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,380
RYAN: We're rich, but classless as hell.

649
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,819
(laughter)

650
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:20,059
KATE: I'm really surprised to hear that.

651
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:22,279
JERRY: It's that new money. RYAN: Yeah.

652
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,639
(laughter)

653
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:29,400
JERRY: So you pull the cart out north.

654
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,259
You recall these events.

655
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:42,399
And you spend a mostly uneventful day of travel far enough north until it starts to get dark.

656
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,980
You think that you could probably get to Westbridge tomorrow.

657
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:52,099
Maybe spend the night in there and then continue on to the east from there.

658
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,779
But now it is time to set up camp.

659
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,400
KRIS: Ooh-wee! JERRY: Tell me more. Tell me how it goes.

660
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,419
KATE: I'm going to pull over next to a very healthy-looking tree.

661
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,160
Which I think will give us shelter--

662
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,140
JERRY: The healthiest tree. KATE Yeah, the healthiest tree.

663
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,120
KATE: Whatever the opposite of our horse is in tree form.

664
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,179
That's where I'm going to stop us.

665
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,779
KRIS: The horse is actually startled by the health.

666
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:16,139
(laughter)

667
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,540
RYAN: (laughing) The virility of the tree?

668
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,740
(laughter)

669
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,460
KRIS: It's worried. JERRY: What is this creature?

670
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,420
KRIS: Ugh!

671
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,900
KATE: I'll hop down and untie the horse and lead it over to a patch of grass and say,

672
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,700
You got to get some meat on these bones, kid.

673
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,180
It's rough stuff.

674
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,740
JERRY: The sweetest clover.

675
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,819
Yeah, you're able to haul him over, tie him off a little bit.

676
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,539
Make sure he doesn't go to far.

677
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:44,579
Which might be difficult for this horse, honestly.

678
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,180
How are the rest of you preparing camp?

679
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,400
AMY: I'm going to volunteer for first watch up on the thing.

680
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,880
But before we go to sleep, I cast Goodberry. Chat! JERRY: Oh, ho, ho!

681
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,100
KATE: Nice! JERRY: (laughs)

682
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,840
AMY: So I make up to ten berries appear in my hand and are infused with magic for the duration.

683
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,139
And it lasts for 24 hours.

684
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,500
You can use your action to eat one berry.

685
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,639
Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

686
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,199
No more food problems, and a little pocket heal.

687
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,759
KRIS: Nice. AMY: So I do this and I toss everybody three berries.

688
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,960
AMY: And I keep one for myself.

689
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,380
JERRY: That's right. That's your pocket berry. KATE: Why just one?

690
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,980
AMY: Because I make ten and that... adds up to math right?

691
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,179
KATE: Well, three, three, three, one?

692
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,140
AMY: Isn't that nine? And then ten?

693
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,679
KATE: Well but why wouldn't you save-- You know what? You do you.

694
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,799
AMY: I got it. KATE: Sounds great.

695
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,180
AMY: Because I'm great! No, I'm joking. That's his thing.

696
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:37,819
Because I'm okay.

697
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,600
JERRY: Yeah.

698
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,619
KATE: Because I'm druid.

699
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,779
JERRY: Because I'm reasonable.

700
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,760
AMY: Yeah. JERRY: It's a good brand. We can go with that.

701
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,140
KATE: Pop that berry right in.

702
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:51,779
JERRY: Exactly. One of these berries is like an all-day Lunchables situation.

703
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,600
KRIS: Right. JERRY: Just flowing.

704
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,000
JERRY: It's like a Gobstopper, essentially. Right?

705
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,539
How are you preparing-- Are you preparing...?

706
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:01,860
Is this how you look in-game as well?

707
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,700
KRIS: Yeah.

708
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:05,179
KATE: Just reading your dark rituals. Yeah. AMY: It's so dark magic.

709
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:07,639
KRIS: No. I was trying to figure out whether or not Alarm,

710
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,799
which I can do as a ritual, works in a radius that is functional.

711
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,360
But it is a 20-foot cube.

712
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,440
So I don't know that the lay of the land is going to work.

713
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,039
Although I'd prefer to place it away from us to where I would imagine somebody could approach.

714
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,139
JERRY: The optimal attack vector? KRIS: Yeah.

715
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:28,619
KATE: The cube of danger. JERRY: You're welcome to create it as a...

716
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,180
KRIS: Then I create it.

717
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,179
Does it fail? I don't think it does.

718
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:39,919
JERRY: So you see K'thriss Drow'b leave camp.

719
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,680
He just walks slowly toward the road that you peeled the cart off of.

720
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:50,179
You hold your focus up toward that red star.

721
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,139
And you hear four small-- it sounds like arrows almost.

722
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:57,440
JERRY: Like you hear things whistling through the air. KRIS: (thwip sounds)

723
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,679
JERRY: But you see four ruby columns...

724
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,839
AMY: (whispering) Whoa.

725
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,560
JERRY: launched as though from a geosynchronous platform,

726
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,340
describe an area of protection.

727
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,000
KRIS: Okay. JERRY: And as they plant themselves,

728
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,079
JERRY: you see them shimmer and become invisible.

729
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,779
KRIS: Do you guys want to hear this if someone breaches this or should it just be me that gets woken up?

730
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,720
AMY: It should be... everybody. KATE: Yeah I think everybody's good.

731
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,500
AMY: Should be everybody.

732
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,059
KRIS: Okay, let's do that. RYAN: I'm good.

733
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:25,880
(laughter)

734
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,900
AMY: Donaar needs his beauty rest.

735
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,400
KRIS: Okay. The three of us and you--

736
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,480
RYAN: I don't need every little rabbit setting this thing off.

737
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
JERRY: Yeah exactly. (meowing sound)

738
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,620
KRIS: I can define it to avoid wildlife. RYAN: All right do that.

739
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,239
KATE: And then still also... RYAN: And then tell me.

740
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:38,719
RYAN: I'll delegate.

741
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
KRIS: Okay. I-- RYAN: As leader.

742
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,559
KRIS: Good night.

743
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,460
JERRY: Good night!

744
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:45,219
KATE: How long does that last?

745
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,840
KRIS: Like... all day.

746
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,760
KATE: All day long. KRIS: It's a long time.

747
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,080
JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen.

748
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,539
How do you prepare yourself for sleepy time?

749
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:54,860
RYAN: Oh I post up on this nice little cart I got here.

750
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,700
And I curl up and go to sleep.

751
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,260
JERRY: So you-- There is-- RYAN: (laughs) I say, bye everyone. See you in eight!

752
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,960
JERRY: So in the back of this cart...

753
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,340
Is just like-- It just got wheeled out.

754
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,920
They must have just called back for it.

755
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,139
They did not clean the back of it out.

756
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:22,900
During this ride over it has been just a cacophony of nails, pins, S-hooks...

757
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:29,159
Like all the stuff you'd have to learn blacksmithing.

758
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:41,259
There's a few hammers, other tools, and then there's just this heap of burlap and leather canvas in the back.

759
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,100
You think it might be all-weather covering or something for the cart itself.

760
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:50,940
But you nestle yourself back--

761
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,200
JERRY: away from the sharper tools. AMY: Like a little dog. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

762
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,239
KRIS: Yeah, he's just marching in a circle for a little while.

763
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,279
JERRY: Yeah exactly.

764
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,880
JERRY: Just scratching with his feet. KRIS: Yeah.

765
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,300
RYAN: I give the teeth a good brush, and then I just, night-night.

766
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,740
KATE: What's your toothbrush named again?

767
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,399
RYAN: Percival. And my sword's name is Toothbrush.

768
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,559
KATE: Right. JERRY: Nice.

769
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:12,659
JERRY: I like the idea that it's a dragon's toothbrush.

770
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,079
It's kind of awesome.

771
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:23,199
But as you curl up back against these heaps, you hear snoring.

772
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,860
AMY: (gasps)

773
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,519
AMY: A stowaway. RYAN: We're unobservant.

774
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:28,480
KRIS: Oh yeah. We're not good at this.

775
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,340
KATE: Listen! I was driving. It was your jobs--

776
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,360
KATE: to inspect inside the cart. AMY: You guys were in the cart with him!

777
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,480
RYAN: That cart could have been a mimic!

778
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,519
(laughter)

779
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,619
RYAN: Is it a mimic? KATE: Not everything's a mimic!

780
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,739
RYAN: I don't know that. I'm just learning this game.

781
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,039
KATE: Everything's a mimic.

782
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,579
RYAN: First thing I touched tried to eat me. KATE: That's true.

783
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,559
RYAN: I assume everything will try to eat me. KATE: That's fair.

784
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,380
AMY: Well what do you do? You're the only one in there with him.

785
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,259
RYAN: Eh. I'm all right.

786
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,780
(laughter)

787
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,200
KRIS: He's sleeping. I'm sleeping.

788
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,299
RYAN: This guy's got the right idea.

789
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,280
AMY: Just pounding on him, use him like a pillow.

790
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,080
RYAN: Yeah.

791
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,739
KRIS: You said it, buddy! RYAN: Yeah.

792
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,880
KATE: (laughing) You know what? RYAN: Amen.

793
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,500
KATE: That's enough adventure for today. RYAN: Yep.

794
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,440
KRIS: Yeah.

795
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,460
JERRY: You just fucking check out.

796
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,800
All right. I love it. I could not be more pleased.

797
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,280
KRIS: This is ridiculous. Can we also hear it? Or are we just--

798
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,120
JERRY: Oh no. Yeah, you're there casting spells. KRIS: I guess I'm too far.

799
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,440
KRIS: Yeah, I don't hear anything.

800
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,700
I should have set Alarm inside of the cart.

801
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:19,920
KRIS: Okay. AMY: That's too bad.

802
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:21,819
JERRY: Right. So you're out.

803
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,320
RYAN: I'm about to be, yeah. JERRY: Yeah.

804
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,639
KRIS: You wish it was quieter.

805
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,619
RYAN: Yeah, I was like, it's a little loud in here!

806
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:29,739
KATE: I'm still talking to Coriander.

807
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:34,699
RYAN: Yeah. So Coriander has eaten as much grass as Coriander's going to eat.

808
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:36,139
KATE: That's good. Okay.

809
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,579
JERRY: You just bring her back. KATE: Well that's not going to stop me from talking to her.

810
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:42,440
JERRY: Oh, no. No. Coriander's getting the full-meal deal here.

811
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,679
KATE: Yep. I'm telling her about the top three cart rides I've ever taken.

812
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,860
Because I think it's relevant to her interests.

813
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,980
Trying to find anything I can find in common with this horse.

814
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,579
JERRY: I love you're just trying to make that love connection. You know what I mean?

815
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:03,699
KATE: Yeah always. Okay so I'm going to bring Coriander and tie her back up to the wagon.

816
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:04,980
JERRY: Yep. Absolutely.

817
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:11,920
KATE: And I'm going to walk slowly past... the cart?

818
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,800
And maybe I'd hear something inside. Do I?

819
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,380
JERRY: You hear the sound of snoring in there.

820
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,559
KATE: Does it sound like a dragon snoring? RYAN: It's me.

821
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,680
KATE: Or does it sound like maybe a different sized creature snoring?

822
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,859
JERRY: Hmm! Try a perception roll. KATE: Hmph!

823
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,700
KATE: Hmph! Okay. Okay.

824
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,260
KATE: Perception is wisdom. KRIS: You can take a good one if you need it.

825
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,580
KATE: 14! KRIS: Oh you're all right.

826
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:41,439
JERRY: You think that this is a smaller, less guttural snore.

827
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,619
KATE: (high-pitched snoring sound)

828
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,079
JERRY: This is-- RYAN: Another mouse?

829
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,420
JERRY: This is not a large creature.

830
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,059
KATE: For a minute I think maybe this is what Donaar sounds like when he's snoring.

831
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,000
Maybe this is just his sinuses?

832
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,679
But then I think I should check.

833
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,379
JERRY: It doesn't make sense. RYAN: Check my adenoids.

834
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,700
JERRY: Yeah exactly. KATE: I've heard some crazy dragonborn snores before.

835
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,199
JERRY: CPAP. KATE: Trust me! But not like this.

836
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,060
KATE: I'm going to just, politely, open the door and be like,

837
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,340
You got everything you need in there?

838
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,920
You got a blanket?

839
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,400
RYAN: I'm good!

840
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:15,719
KATE: Do you hear a snoring sound maybe?

841
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,000
RYAN: Was I snoring? Oh I'm sorry.

842
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,719
KATE: It's still going. I'm like,

843
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:23,539
No I don't think it's you unless you got another mouth in there.

844
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:28,719
RYAN: (sighs) I don't-- What does it take to get eight hours of sleep around you people? I swear...

845
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,159
AMY: I'm up on the roof like,

846
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,119
Hey! I'm taking first watch so you guys can sleep. Let's go! (claps)

847
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,139
JERRY: Clap, clap!

848
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:38,599
KATE: Oh! I hear a little snoring happening in here. You want to help us try to figure out what's going on?

849
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,199
Come on down.

850
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,920
AMY: I come down. I'm like,

851
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,739
There's supposed to be snoring. You're supposed to be sleeping. You're all awake.

852
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:48,079
KATE: Well see-- JERRY: You two. You. Also...

853
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,840
KATE: We're all awake but there's still snoring happening.

854
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,340
And it's coming from inside the cart!

855
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,539
RYAN: Is it the horse?

856
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:55,579
(laughter)

857
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,420
KRIS: I need this to be simple so I can just sleep! RYAN: Yeah!

858
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,200
AMY: Wait. Am I standing next to Rosie? I immediately want to do one of these.

859
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,539
AMY: Where I go to protect her. KATE: Block her?

860
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:03,360
AMY: Whuh (sound of surprise)!

861
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,260
KATE: But your arm whiffs over my head.

862
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,320
AMY: I go way over!

863
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:07,779
JERRY: You keep reaching.

864
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
AMY: Uh... !

865
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,740
JERRY: One of these times is going to be the time.

866
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,119
KATE: She loves it.

867
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,940
KRIS: If I don't get my four hours. If I don't get my trance...

868
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:19,400
KATE: If I don't get my trance, I'm a... KRIS: I'm a real bear.

869
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,099
KATE: rude boy. RYAN: Look. I'm really tired.

870
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:22,259
RYAN: Is this what it's going to take?

871
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,840
I got to wake this thing up. And I just start shaking it.

872
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,960
JERRY: "Ugh!" RYAN: What's your deal?

873
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,260
JERRY: "Ugh! Ugh!"

874
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:36,180
And then you see this shape just poking out at random in these folds.

875
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,159
KRIS: Is it in a sack? JERRY: Trying desperately to escape.

876
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,899
RYAN: Ugh. God. Another mimic.

877
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,000
I say, whuh (sound of surprise)!

878
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,920
(laughter)

879
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:44,739
KATE: It's a sack mimic!

880
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:47,839
AMY: I look at Rosie and I motion to her quarterstaff and I go, poke it.

881
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,960
KATE: Yeah. I poke it.

882
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:49,960
JERRY: "Ow!"

883
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,519
"Ow!"

884
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,880
KRIS: It knows pain.

885
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,920
RYAN: Yeah. I pull out my sword.

886
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,960
KATE: I'm going to hold my staff in a threatening way, but I stop poking for now.

887
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,139
But I think this person-- entity-- can sense that there's still something about to poke them.

888
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:05,719
JERRY: Something rod-esque. KATE: Yeah.

889
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,440
KATE: Got my rod out. I say, hey!

890
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:08,659
RYAN: You and me both. KATE: Who are you?

891
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:09,519
AMY: (restrained laughter)

892
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,380
JERRY: So you see two hands...

893
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,880
pull it down...

894
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,580
and then you see an older gentleman...

895
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,139
pushing it away and then backing against the inside of the cart.

896
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,019
KATE: Human?

897
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,080
JERRY: Yes.

898
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,859
Just old and small.

899
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:34,199
KATE: Okay.

900
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,639
AMY: Best kind. RYAN: Yeah.

901
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,819
KATE: I do like old and small.

902
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,059
JERRY: "Did you steal this cart?"

903
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,160
KATE: No!

904
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,119
We got it from Todd Waelvur.

905
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,360
JERRY: "I'm Waelvur."

906
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,719
KATE: Oh. Are you Dad Waelvur?

907
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,080
RYAN: Does your kid like oil rags?

908
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,199
KATE: Yeah, is your kid the guy who works in the shop?

909
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,200
JERRY: "He's obsessed with cleanliness, yes."

910
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,699
KATE: Okay. He said he didn't know where you were. I put my staff down.

911
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,519
JERRY: "Well-- I..."

912
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,119
"about..."

913
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:00,759
"ten..."

914
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,480
"in the morning..."

915
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,199
"is the first..."

916
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,159
"of many naps..."

917
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,940
AMY/KATE: Mmm. JERRY: "that occur."

918
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,019
JERRY: "This is my napping cart."

919
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,340
KATE: I see.

920
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,540
RYAN: Real quick. So you have other carts?

921
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,219
JERRY: "Uh... Sometimes."

922
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,619
RYAN: Better carts than this?

923
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:20,259
KRIS: You take a nap in the worst cart.

924
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,320
RYAN: Just for (laughs) free.

925
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,900
JERRY: "Well no... We would never sell this cart."

926
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,079
KATE: Mmm. RYAN: Hmm.

927
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,679
RYAN: But you have access to other carts. This is good info.

928
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:30,919
KATE: Yeah. RYAN: For later.

929
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,400
KATE: Your son may have pulled a fast one on us.

930
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,740
We definitely got this cart from him, although we did get it from a coupon.

931
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,000
Does that maybe clear things up?

932
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,399
AMY: Oh. I'll show him the thing. RYAN: Show him the thing, yeah.

933
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
AMY: And again, I'll put it where it's just out of reach.

934
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,619
And if he goes to touch it, I go-- (sounds of consternation)

935
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:47,779
(growling) Oh don't touch it!

936
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,800
JERRY: No, as soon as you unfold it and he sees the symbology at the top.

937
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,700
He sees the coupon at the bottom, he's like,

938
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,840
"All right."

939
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,940
"When are you going back to Red Larch?"

940
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:03,219
AMY: When we're done. KATE: When the raiding ceases.

941
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,980
KATE: Show him the thing again.

942
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,099
AMY: I go... JERRY: It's dark in the cart.

943
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:09,920
AMY: Oh. Yeah okay.

944
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,420
RYAN: Why don't you use Faerie Fire? Make it brighter. KATE: The raiding must cease.

945
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:15,899
AMY: I mean, you know. JERRY: Yeah, he gets up.

946
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,300
JERRY: He realizes that touching it is no go.

947
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,780
AMY: Mm-hmm. JERRY: But he gets very, very close...

948
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,220
AMY: That's fine. JERRY: to the document.

949
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:26,639
JERRY: And assesses it thoroughly.

950
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,820
Seems to wonder if this deal is worth as much trouble as it has been.

951
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:36,340
And says...

952
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:41,920
"So Stone Bridge, Beliard, Stone Road..."

953
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,159
"So you won't be back for days."

954
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,240
AMY: I mean, we'll be back as soon as we can get this done.

955
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,700
You know, the more help, the merrier.

956
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:54,039
Get us back to town quicker.

957
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:55,279
RYAN: We're doing this for you, man.

958
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:03,860
JERRY: He scoots back underneath these folds of leather and burlap.

959
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:10,519
You can hear a glass bottle tink against the base of the cart.

960
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,120
He pulls out a bottle and says,

961
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,000
"Three days is fine."

962
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:16,980
KATE: What you got in that bottle?

963
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,180
JERRY: "Some for you."

964
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:20,839
KRIS: Ooh. RYAN: Nice.

965
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,039
AMY: I give him-- JERRY: Gestures back.

966
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:24,960
KATE: I'm in. I'm going to hop in that cart.

967
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,220
Let's see what kind of poison you brewing.

968
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:28,219
AMY: When the cart's a rocking-- (laughs)

969
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,959
RYAN: (increasingly louder) What's it take to get to sleep in this place?

970
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,280
KATE: Sleep outside, kid!

971
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:35,839
RYAN: I was here first!

972
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,400
KATE: The grown-ups are talking!

973
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,860
JERRY: Exactly.

974
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,079
He takes the...

975
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:49,660
He grabs a few square feet of this material and pulls it over in the manner of a bedsheet.

976
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:54,159
And extends the bottle out.

977
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:56,399
KATE: All right. RYAN: We got to get a better cart out of this.

978
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,380
KATE: I hop right in there.

979
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,019
Slide right in.

980
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:01,400
RYAN: I could sleep through this.

981
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,880
KRIS: (whispering) I'm riding on the roof tomorrow!

982
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,559
(laughter)

983
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:07,500
RYAN: I say, I could sleep through this no problem.

984
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,099
(laughter) RYAN: Just turn over.

985
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:11,500
RYAN: Just turn my back to it. JERRY: This is fine.

986
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
JERRY: This is fine. This is fine.

987
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,720
It's fine.

988
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,000
AMY: So I was going to take first watch from on top of the cart,

989
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,179
but I'm now going to clamber up the tree and just kind of like watch from up there.

990
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:23,919
JERRY: Stay with friends. AMY: Yeah.

991
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,320
JERRY: So this-- AMY: Good tree.

992
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,440
JERRY: You don't think that it's just the darkness inside the cart.

993
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:37,339
You think that this liquid would be jet black even at noon.

994
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,480
KATE: Mmm. AMY: Good shit.

995
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,699
JERRY: You don't-- yeah. This is something someone has made,

996
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,900
and no one has tested it for purity.

997
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,039
But yeah it is like being kicked in the mouth by a horse.

998
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,659
KATE: Dark hooch. JERRY: Yeah.

999
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,840
KATE: I betray no reaction at first. JERRY: Oh, no, no.

1000
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:57,419
KATE: And then I say,

1001
00:47:58,059 --> 00:47:59,579
It's woody.

1002
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,360
JERRY: "It's made from wood."

1003
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,539
KATE: Mmm. I could tell.

1004
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:04,619
RYAN: Good mouth feel.

1005
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:05,759
(laughter)

1006
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,220
AMY: That's what they do with old carts.

1007
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:09,279
RYAN: I'm detecting notes of... JERRY: Oaky.

1008
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,380
KATE: (laughing) That's what they do with old carts. It's a cart brew.

1009
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,019
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Toxic.

1010
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:15,780
KRIS: You do this, and it makes a grinding sound.

1011
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,019
(laughter)

1012
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,119
RYAN: It's like a rock tumbler.

1013
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,579
JERRY: Yeah exactly. KRIS: Ah... !

1014
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,679
JERRY: It's just like a jar of marbles.

1015
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:25,000
AMY: Oh my god... JERRY: There's something in there.

1016
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,699
JERRY: But as you see so you have just made your peace with this.

1017
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:29,519
RYAN: Yeah.

1018
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,000
JERRY: Totally fine.

1019
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,139
JERRY: It's totally fine. RYAN: I need my eight.

1020
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:33,319
RYAN: Eight and skate.

1021
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:35,440
KRIS: It's me and Coriander then I guess.

1022
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,639
KRIS: Oh no, you're up there. Okay so I... AMY: I'm up on the tree.

1023
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:40,000
KRIS: I sleep horse-side tonight.

1024
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,960
Because I don't want to be in there.

1025
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,380
JERRY: Perfect.

1026
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:51,539
Works fine. The night goes as uneventfully or as eventfully as you choose.

1027
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:53,860
KATE: Never kiss and tell. JERRY: No, no. Absolutely not.

1028
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,519
JERRY: What happens in the cart.

1029
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:56,960
And so...

1030
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,860
AMY: That's for the fan art to decide.

1031
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:03,720
JERRY: In the morning-- Exactly. We want to see this kind of material in the fan art, channel.

1032
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:06,659
KATE: I burst out. I'm like, boy do I have some stories to tell you guys!

1033
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:09,299
AMY: No... ! RYAN: And I come out and go, oh my god. The stories.

1034
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,480
(laughter)

1035
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,880
JERRY: He just stumbles out and-- RYAN: Oh god. They were so tiny and wrinkly!

1036
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,940
(laughter)

1037
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,320
It was like, have you ever seen the movie Critters?

1038
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,820
KRIS: At one point I was being used for support!

1039
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,620
(laughter)

1040
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:23,019
RYAN: Ugh. JERRY: Leverage!

1041
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:24,059
KRIS: Ugh.

1042
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,980
JERRY: You just fall out. Ugh!

1043
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:28,799
And then crawl way. No! No.

1044
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,340
RYAN: It was like-- KRIS: No more spirits.

1045
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,720
RYAN: It was like two little ball sacks slamming into each other!

1046
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:38,019
JERRY: It was terrible. RYAN: And it wouldn't stop!

1047
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:38,920
KRIS: That's not great.

1048
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,720
RYAN: Anyway, I'm great!

1049
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:41,619
KRIS: I got my eight.

1050
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:43,719
KATE: I got my eight! That's all that matters.

1051
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,299
RYAN: Got my eight. AMY: Got those spells back.

1052
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,700
RYAN: Full HP. JERRY: Exactly.

1053
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,360
KATE: Oh yeah! Full rest.

1054
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,039
JERRY: Exactly. So this mist-- KRIS: Foul rest.

1055
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:52,639
KATE: Some of us. (clicks tongue) JERRY: Yeah, mist is rising--

1056
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,460
JERRY: Oh!

1057
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,980
RYAN: I tell my troubles to the horse.

1058
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,900
AMY: Wait. Before we get going.

1059
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,639
JERRY: Walnut, how can I help? AMY: Because it's a new morning,

1060
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:00,759
AMY: I want to cast Goodberry again.

1061
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,340
Each of you now get two more.

1062
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,240
So you should have a total of five unless you ate one.

1063
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,080
KRIS: Five good berries. RYAN: Mine are in my bag.

1064
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,319
AMY: And I give one to little dude.

1065
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:13,439
I'm like, you're going to probably need this more than I do.

1066
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,500
JERRY: It's like the classic druid hangover cure.

1067
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,380
AMY: Yeah, I'm like-- RYAN: You give everyone one?

1068
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,220
AMY: You have five now. RYAN: Oh right. Five.

1069
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:20,500
JERRY: Total. RYAN: I'll eat one for breakfast.

1070
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,039
AMY: So now you have four. JERRY: Exactly.

1071
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:23,639
JERRY: It's juicy. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Wait. AMY: Get that HP.

1072
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:24,659
RYAN: I had five.

1073
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:27,179
AMY: Now you have four. &gt;&gt; RYAN: I ate one. KRIS: Now you have four because you ate one.

1074
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:29,139
AMY: (laughing) Bless it. Anyway!

1075
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,840
RYAN: So uh... should-- do I roll... ? Or--

1076
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:38,079
JERRY: I'll take it from here, Donaar Blit'zen.

1077
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:39,139
So...

1078
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,460
As you awake, you can see--

1079
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:50,519
So this part of the Long Road that goes north,

1080
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:54,819
to the east is the Sumber Hills.

1081
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,900
Just these great--

1082
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,180
There's many theories about why it's shaped this way.

1083
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:05,460
But it's basically just this range of hills that these roads are designed to get around.

1084
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:15,340
The mist is rising off of these hills as you get your contraption back on the road.

1085
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,799
And you think that Waelvur sleeps a lot.

1086
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,780
You think that he sleeps like a lot. Like maybe too much.

1087
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,220
KATE: He's pretty tired. RYAN: It's Lyme disease.

1088
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:24,599
AMY: (laughing) Okay, Rosie.

1089
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:25,779
KATE: He's pretty worn out.

1090
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,500
JERRY: He's exhausted!

1091
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,240
KATE: How you doing in there, little pickle?

1092
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:30,839
AMY: (laughing) Little pickle.

1093
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,579
JERRY: I wrung this man out!

1094
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:34,699
AMY: He's nursing a crushed pelvis.

1095
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:37,859
JERRY: Yeah exactly. He needs Goodberry! Is what he does.

1096
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,780
JERRY: He needs Goodberry-- RYAN: Should I lay on hands?

1097
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,540
(laughter)

1098
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:42,759
AMY: Goodberry would do that.

1099
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,440
JERRY: Exactly. It's a good Goodberry.

1100
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,019
So as I say, you pull back out.

1101
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:50,900
Occasionally you see...

1102
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,139
As I say this is the Long Road.

1103
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,940
JERRY: Many, many carts like yours. Nicer carts. AMY: Okay.

1104
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,000
JERRY: Superior carts. &gt;&gt; KATE: Wow. AMY: Okay don't rub it in.

1105
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,679
JERRY: Carts you could be proud to own.

1106
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,019
RYAN: Can we... rob them? JERRY: Take to piracy?

1107
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:06,880
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Don't worry.

1108
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,400
JERRY: Road pirates. AMY: Don't worry.

1109
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,480
JERRY: Road pirates. RYAN: Oh good.

1110
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,940
KRIS: What a cool turn for this adventure.

1111
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,420
RYAN: Do you got plans? Okay, good. KATE: Walnut?

1112
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,220
KATE: You got a little something? AMY: It's okay.

1113
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:16,279
AMY: We just got a contingency plan... JERRY: Thorn Whip?

1114
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,960
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: for better carts.

1115
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,320
KATE: Thorn Whip a cart!

1116
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:21,980
AMY: I get it. RYAN: Whip the drivers in the face.

1117
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,260
JERRY: With cash. That's the whip.

1118
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,680
KATE: (laughing) That's right.

1119
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,419
JERRY: So as you are...

1120
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:31,339
You entered a very, very nondescript section of road.

1121
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,180
You can't quite see Westbridge off in the distance yet.

1122
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,960
But you know, in your mind that it's like Rosie GPS,

1123
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,599
You know exactly where you are on this map,

1124
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:49,559
and you know that at any moment now you'll be able to see the town of Westbridge cropping up there.

1125
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,320
And you know that's where you'll take the east road.

1126
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,300
Which is called the Stone Road.

1127
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,560
It's all stone shit here.

1128
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,860
It's like Westbridge, Stone Road, Stone Bridge, Beliard.

1129
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,220
You're not sure who named this stuff, but you know that you could have done better.

1130
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:03,719
KATE: They're not very creative. JERRY: Exactly, right?

1131
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:05,179
JERRY: And so...

1132
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,340
But there are on this point of the road going north

1133
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:14,599
there are deep furrows to the left and right.

1134
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,839
Almost just these gullies.

1135
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,880
So it's almost as if the road has risen up,

1136
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,380
but you can't necessarily see all the way down the edges...

1137
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,199
of the road on each side.

1138
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:33,360
And it is times like this, party, that we roll perception checks.

1139
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:36,639
AMY: I was getting scared. KATE: I know.

1140
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,440
KATE: Thought it'd be initiative. RYAN: Yeah.

1141
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,220
JERRY: Oh, no. There will be an initiative later. Don't worry.

1142
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,180
KATE: Oh boy.

1143
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,199
KRIS: Yes boy. Oh that's not bad at all.

1144
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,140
AMY: Ooh. KATE: Going to be a ten.

1145
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:48,139
RYAN: 12.

1146
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,360
KRIS: (British accent) I got a 20.

1147
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,200
RYAN: Nice. KATE: Wow...

1148
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:54,299
AMY: I got a 17 and with my bonus that is a 22.

1149
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,539
JERRY: Oh that's very good.

1150
00:53:56,519 --> 00:53:57,679
You see...

1151
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:03,799
Really out of the corner of your eye, and every time you try to center it in your vision,

1152
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:13,719
this black shape, orbited by two smaller black shapes,

1153
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:20,740
it's just always shifting, always just out of the edge of your perception.

1154
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,940
Off to the right of the cart. And it is keeping pace with the cart.

1155
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,420
KRIS/KATE: Mmm. AMY: Mmm okay.

1156
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:33,219
KRIS: What's over there? Is it like low-grass and stuff, or like trees?

1157
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:37,839
JERRY: Oh yeah exactly. Basically imagine that at this point the road has been up and supported,

1158
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,240
maybe it was marshy or something underneath,

1159
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,920
but the road here has been reinforced

1160
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,700
and sitting up on broken rock and gravel.

1161
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:52,039
And then there is a gulley on each side. where it's difficult--

1162
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,139
JERRY: Unless you're at the very top looking down. KRIS: I see, I see.

1163
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:58,000
JERRY: It might be difficult to see exactly what it is.

1164
00:54:58,059 --> 00:54:59,599
But you are alerted now.

1165
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,259
AMY: Okay.

1166
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:07,019
So I'm on top of the cart and I just lean down to Rosie and go,

1167
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,500
We got company.

1168
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:12,220
JERRY: Just letting you know. ROSIE: Ugh I always wanted to say that. It's so cool.

1169
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,139
KATE: All right.

1170
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:15,679
AMY: Sorry I didn't say it in a cool way.

1171
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,079
KATE: That's okay. AMY: But we got it.

1172
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:19,239
JERRY: You hear the horse; you hear Coriander whine.

1173
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:20,500
RYAN: Break out the good china. KATE: Okay.

1174
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:26,219
JERRY: Coriander has not deviated from your direction.

1175
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:30,939
But there is like a high note with each exhalation.

1176
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:33,500
KATE: Okay.

1177
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:35,799
KRIS: Give it a Goodberry.

1178
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,860
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: I can heal it.

1179
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:42,659
KATE: I can do Pass without Trace.

1180
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:45,139
We can try to outstrip it.

1181
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:46,079
AMY: Wow. KATE: Want to try that?

1182
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,360
AMY: Can you do everything?

1183
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,840
KATE: Just Pass without Trace.

1184
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,400
And Darkness, and Silence, and Darkvision, and Minor Illusion. It's not...

1185
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,220
AMY: No, I meant can you get everything that we're currently in-- KATE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1186
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:55,419
(laughter)

1187
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,119
RYAN: Are you the best one ever?

1188
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,679
JERRY: Wow. KRIS: Should I just go to sleep again?

1189
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:00,340
KRIS: Can I have sex with the old guy? KATE: Yes.

1190
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,960
(laughter)

1191
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,139
KATE: I mean, it doesn't hurt.

1192
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,819
It actually feels pretty good.

1193
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,440
So a veil of shadows and silence radiates from you,

1194
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,360
masking you and your companions from detection.

1195
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,900
For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you,

1196
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,880
including you, has a plus ten bonus to dexterity

1197
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,700
and can't be tracked except by magical means.

1198
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,280
And it lasts for an hour.

1199
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:18,899
JERRY: M'kay. AMY: Hmm.

1200
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,840
KATE: Shall I?

1201
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:23,880
RYAN: Well you guys are having a little conversation.

1202
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,059
Are we aware of this?

1203
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:25,820
KATE: Pass without Trace?

1204
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,920
AMY: Yeah, go for it. KATE: All right. Pass without Trace.

1205
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,019
KATE: I do it.

1206
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:34,519
AMY: And then I'll lean over because now we can talk freely inside this protective bubble. And go,

1207
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,420
Hey, boys. We're being followed, so if you want to...

1208
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:40,679
strap on your armor.

1209
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,740
Get ready to go.

1210
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:43,899
RYAN: Followed by what?

1211
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,940
AMY: I don't... Listen. It's shadowy.

1212
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,139
RYAN: (sighs) AMY: I don't know.

1213
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,480
RYAN: Is it a deer? It's always fucking something with you, druid.

1214
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,860
KRIS: How soon do you think-- Are they going to catch up with us?

1215
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,019
AMY: Three things-- Do I think that they're gaining on us?

1216
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,139
JERRY: They appear to be just maintaining...

1217
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,839
AMY: They're content to follow us, perhaps, all the way to our destination?

1218
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,980
KRIS: Hmm. Okay.

1219
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,960
AMY: They're not advancing.

1220
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:15,000
KATE: I know that we're close enough to Westbridge that my Pass without Trace should be able to get us...

1221
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,639
JERRY: Probably not all the way there. KATE: Not all the way there. Nope.

1222
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:17,819
KATE: Probably not all the way there. Okay.

1223
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,680
But maybe enough to get this thing bored, because it can't see us anymore.

1224
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:23,899
AMY: Okay. Well let's try to see what happens--

1225
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,160
AMY: if we continue. KATE: Let's bore it to death.

1226
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,300
AMY: Yeah. Let's bore them to death!

1227
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,460
(laughter)

1228
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,380
JERRY: Okay. RYAN: Exciting!

1229
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,019
(laughter)

1230
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:32,900
RYAN: What an exciting adventure! Right folks?

1231
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,320
AMY: So this lasts for an hour? KATE: An hour.

1232
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,620
AMY: Okay, so... KRIS: Full hour.

1233
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,119
AMY: At about 40 minutes can I do a--

1234
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:39,779
RYAN: (laughing) Real time. AMY: perception check to see if they're still following?

1235
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,159
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1236
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:42,139
AMY: All right.

1237
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:43,659
KRIS: Yeah, I don't know what the endgame is.

1238
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:47,299
Like we may want to-- Do we double back on them because then they're like,

1239
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,360
Oh! The cart we were going to rob is gone.

1240
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:51,400
And then they just go back the other way?

1241
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,720
AMY: I got an 11. Does anyone else want to see if they're still following us?

1242
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:57,139
KRIS: Sure. RYAN: Do we want to fight them?

1243
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,380
RYAN: 20! Natural 20! KATE: Nice!

1244
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,019
KATE: Nice. I did not get that. JERRY: Real natural 20?

1245
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,019
AMY: Real. KRIS: You see all carts.

1246
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:04,579
JERRY: Yeah exactly!

1247
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:05,619
RYAN: I got persuasion.

1248
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:09,839
JERRY: No, it's like you enter the Cart Force!

1249
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:13,759
And you're able to perceive a universe--

1250
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,560
RYAN: I'm like, I'll tell you if there were deer or not!

1251
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:19,599
JERRY: This is the crossroads where every cart must one day pass.

1252
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,839
KRIS: You know Cerebro where Professor X can see... RYAN: (singing) Welcome to the crossroads!

1253
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,019
RYAN: (singing) KRIS: all carts.

1254
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:27,239
JERRY: Exactly. So you... KATE: It's a weird show.

1255
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:32,179
JERRY: So you see, even clearer--

1256
00:58:32,739 --> 00:58:34,779
Walnut got the impression--

1257
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:38,759
Always trying to fix her gaze on it,

1258
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,599
but was unable to really get any decent definition.

1259
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,940
Over the edge you can see...

1260
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:55,519
First, two seeking tentacles that end in diamond shapes.

1261
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:56,639
AMY: (laughing) Kris' face again!

1262
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,839
He was like looking away and then he's like,

1263
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,559
AMY: Tentacles? JERRY: Tentacles! Whoa, I'm back!

1264
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:00,639
AMY: Sorry.

1265
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:03,239
JERRY: That sort of end in these diamond shapes.

1266
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:09,420
With these lethal looking structures dripping from the bottom.

1267
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:14,759
But it's 100% maintaining parity with the cart.

1268
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,240
And then as you see it coming up the lip, up the edge,

1269
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:22,479
you can see that these are attached to something like a...

1270
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:25,699
demonic panther.

1271
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:26,919
KRIS: No...

1272
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,360
KRIS: We don't like that! AMY: Ooh!

1273
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,940
KATE: I blame you, completely. RYAN: Land-squid.

1274
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,019
AMY: Ah! Land-squid.

1275
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:33,500
JERRY: But this is the stranger part.

1276
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:44,519
Is that as it crests that hill, you see a smaller one leap on the larger one's back, and then leap closer to the cart.

1277
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:47,900
And then you see another one leap on to the back,

1278
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:50,440
and then leap close to the cart.

1279
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,099
But it trips slightly and has to right itself,

1280
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:57,119
and then keep up with its fellows.

1281
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,119
AMY: Nothing I love more than killing whole families.

1282
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:00,599
RYAN: Gotcha. All right. KATE: That's true.

1283
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:02,559
KATE: That's one thing I know about you, for sure.

1284
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:03,360
RYAN: There's a...

1285
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:09,699
KRIS: Metagame. Do we have cause to know what these are or do our characters not know anything about these?

1286
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:13,079
JERRY: This would be a strange-- You might have heard something about them.

1287
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,920
KRIS: I think that's actually the extent of my-- Kris' actual knowledge of this animal, so okay.

1288
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,740
KATE: I think all I can do is a history check.

1289
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,380
KRIS: They're well read. KATE: Do they exist in any--

1290
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,140
AMY: Yeah, can I do a survival check too?

1291
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:26,219
KRIS: They're storied creatures.

1292
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:31,619
JERRY: I would like to try stuff like that. I mean it is a mystical creature. I can give you--

1293
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:34,619
RYAN: First I say-- I describe what it is to everyone.

1294
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:37,719
My superior dragon eyes have this figured out, everyone.

1295
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:40,159
KATE: Better than the druid's eyes. For sure. JERRY: Penetrated the mists.

1296
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:41,539
RYAN: I've identified this.

1297
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,900
KRIS: What are you guys rolling for to check on this? KATE: I got seven history check.

1298
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,300
KRIS: Oh history? Okay.

1299
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,560
AMY: Yeah what do you got there? RYAN: Oh I got two on history.

1300
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:48,900
JERRY: If you want to approach it...

1301
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:51,659
KRIS: No, I won't do that. RYAN: Approach the beast?

1302
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:55,920
JERRY: Well no, no. I'm saying if you want to approach it with a skill, and I'll give you information that's associated with--

1303
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,760
KRIS: Oh okay. How about investigation?

1304
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,880
KRIS: Would that help me? JERRY: Mmm no.

1305
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,720
JERRY: Because that would require like if one of them were dead in a room.

1306
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:05,920
JERRY: Then you can come in a choose a light. RYAN: Oh like CSI?

1307
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:09,599
KRIS: How about insight? Would that take me there? JERRY: No.

1308
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,219
JERRY: No, I wouldn't think so. KATE: You got some arcana. How about that?

1309
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:12,579
KRIS: History? JERRY: Yeah, we got a history check.

1310
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:14,980
KRIS: "Ar-ca-nah"? All right let's do that. JERRY: Arcana is probably an interesting choice.

1311
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,159
KRIS: There we go.

1312
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,519
KATE: Oh! KRIS: Ooh it's going to be good. It's a 20.

1313
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,720
AMY: Nice. KRIS: All told.

1314
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,619
JERRY: Yeah, this is not a natural creature.

1315
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,820
This is some kind of aberration.

1316
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:32,219
Who knows its origin?

1317
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:34,699
Magical experimentation. Something like that.

1318
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:38,159
But it has, just as a natural part of it,

1319
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,460
it sort of shimmers in place.

1320
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,119
It's hard to detect exactly where it is.

1321
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:45,659
Could be a displacer beast.

1322
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,199
You have heard about creatures like that.

1323
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:55,779
But there are many creatures that have built-in defense mechanisms of this type.

1324
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:02,120
KRIS: Right. I'm concerned that we are going to rile those-- that mom, if those are cubs.

1325
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:09,079
But those tentacles I feel like would accept a yoke and maybe replace this horse.

1326
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:11,079
(laughter)

1327
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:13,920
KATE: Dungeons and fucking Dragons! KRIS: It would be a rad... Yeah.

1328
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,760
RYAN: So wait. We're still invisible right?

1329
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,900
KATE: For now yeah. RYAN: Because we're doing this before the spell wears off,

1330
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,079
RYAN: but it's still following us?

1331
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:23,920
AMY: Yeah, we got 20 minutes left. KATE: So it's tracking us by magical means apparently.

1332
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,980
KRIS: Yeah, I think they're pretty good at this. KATE: Yeah, I think they're pretty magical.

1333
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,340
AMY: Hmm.

1334
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,660
JERRY: So you see a... KATE: So we-- Are we-- Do you want to--

1335
01:02:31,659 --> 01:02:35,639
JERRY: At this point, so you are assessing this situation.

1336
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:40,480
You're saying, we are being hunted by a magical beast.

1337
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:47,679
JERRY: It is at this point, that they begin to lope immediately alongside the cart.

1338
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:54,179
And then she just throws herself at the side of the cart.

1339
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,860
AMY: Great. KRIS: Okay.

1340
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,120
KATE: The cart disintegrates.

1341
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,000
JERRY: Just slams into the cart.

1342
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,860
KRIS: Okay. JERRY: And then you hear Waelvur inside go, "Whoa!"

1343
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,460
RYAN: I was going to say I was going to grab the old guy.

1344
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,639
KRIS: What's our positions again?

1345
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:07,440
KRIS: Am I... Okay wait hold on. You're inside. RYAN: I'm inside.

1346
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,880
KRIS: I think I'm inside as well. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. JERRY: You have been inside before.

1347
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,160
JERRY: Rosie's driving.

1348
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:12,119
RYAN: And these two are in front. KRIS: And you're on the roof.

1349
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:13,319
AMY: I'm up on top. KRIS: Okay.

1350
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:16,299
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. So let's get initiative now.

1351
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,599
RYAN: (Pac-Man sound) Wac-wac. AMY: Boo!

1352
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:20,739
KRIS: (battle music) Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh...

1353
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,599
KRIS: Ooh. KATE: 13.

1354
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:24,239
AMY: Ooh.

1355
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:26,379
KRIS: 15. RYAN: Four.

1356
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,360
JERRY: Four? AMY: Well you have a modifier too-- Oh.

1357
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,840
RYAN: Yes. But a negative.

1358
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,980
I went from five to four. Not unlike my Goodberries.

1359
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,279
KRIS: Consistent. It's like, ah I've done this when I was--

1360
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,380
RYAN: I've done this!

1361
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,119
AMY: 22. &gt;&gt; JERRY: Jeez. AMY: Oh I should write my Goodberries down.

1362
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,780
JERRY: So you're kicking ass. AMY: Walnut's very motivated. &gt;&gt; KATE: She's on top.

1363
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,280
AMY: Which is always horrible because Amy the human never knows what to do first.

1364
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,100
JERRY: And then Donaar is in the S-Zone?

1365
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:49,719
AMY: Yeah. RYAN: No, I'm in the--

1366
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:50,739
KRIS: He comes after Waelvur.

1367
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:52,859
RYAN: I'm the tank. Yeah. AMY: Yeah what about Waelvur?

1368
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:53,920
RYAN: Everyone goes twice.

1369
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,940
JERRY: Oh I'll handle Waelvur. Don't worry about him. KRIS: He's useless.

1370
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,599
AMY: Oh don't worry about him? KRIS: He's no good.

1371
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,900
JERRY: Here. I'll put this blank one here for Waelvur.

1372
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,039
AMY: You just put it all the way to the side.

1373
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,679
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Just put it over here on the left side of the screen.

1374
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,139
KRIS: Every turn he's just, ah!

1375
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,340
JERRY: No, he's...

1376
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:09,119
Ugh!

1377
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,139
(laughter)

1378
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,239
KRIS: Abandon cart.

1379
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:13,199
AMY: Okay. Let's see...

1380
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,619
KATE: He's got pretty low stamina.

1381
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:19,059
(laughter)

1382
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,900
JERRY: All his stamina is all consumed.

1383
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,280
KATE: Mm-hmm. KRIS: Oh yeah.

1384
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,019
RYAN: Use Forest Friends.

1385
01:04:24,019 --> 01:04:26,679
JERRY: Yeah, yeah-- AMY: Oh this is a good time to use Forest Friends.

1386
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:29,000
JERRY: Yeah this is Acquisitions Incorporated... RYAN: I was going to say...

1387
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,280
RYAN: I was going to say this before, make a bird, JERRY: Nights!

1388
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,400
RYAN: and then talk to the bird and get it to spy around what's around us.

1389
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,840
RYAN: But I rolled a 20. AMY: That would have been really good.

1390
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,640
KATE: Wow. AMY: But then I saved the day.

1391
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,559
RYAN: But then I saved the day. AMY: With my ideas and with my roll.

1392
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:40,599
RYAN: And my rolling.

1393
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:42,059
AMY: This is... Yeah. KATE: Your magical dice.

1394
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:43,380
KRIS: What's happening?

1395
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,039
JERRY: Yeah exactly. So, Walnut... AMY: Yes.

1396
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,579
JERRY: It has begun to slam itself against the side of the cart.

1397
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:52,139
The cart seems to be holding together now,

1398
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:53,779
but you don't know a hundred percent...

1399
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:57,299
Obviously, you're not like a cart professional.

1400
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,220
KATE: Not a Cartographer. AMY: So it's tracking us by magic...

1401
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:04,099
RYAN: I see the monster and I say-- JERRY: Rosie Beestinger! Ladies and gentlemen.

1402
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:05,900
RYAN: I see the big, scary monster and I say,

1403
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,260
We're going to need a bigger cart.

1404
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:08,799
KRIS: Ah!

1405
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,019
RYAN: Like the movie!

1406
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:12,059
KATE: The movie, Jaws. KRIS: I don't know how you do it.

1407
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:12,920
KRIS: That's the one.

1408
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,119
JERRY: Are those the jaws?

1409
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,159
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: All right let me just talk this out real quick.

1410
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:18,799
AMY: So I know I have Forest Friends and I'm tempted to use them,

1411
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,980
however this thing's tracking us by magical means

1412
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,980
so I don't really think I can just like...

1413
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,139
throw some meat at it and get it to stop.

1414
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:26,159
JERRY: A snack!

1415
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:28,440
AMY: Yeah. KRIS: Fill the beast with meats!

1416
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:31,159
JERRY: End to end! AMY: Don't fill up on birds.

1417
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:32,659
(laughter)

1418
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:35,139
KATE: What species haven't you eradicated yet?

1419
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,500
AMY: I don't know. KATE: Deer?

1420
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,840
AMY: So many creatures left to kill!

1421
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,260
Pandas. Everybody hates pandas, right?

1422
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,560
(laughter)

1423
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,500
KRIS: It's the last one. Which you send it into combat!

1424
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,619
JERRY: Yeah, it just appear, "Me?"

1425
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:51,239
JERRY: "But I'm a panda." KRIS: You're up, chief.

1426
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,719
AMY: Who's got the best chance of doing something here?

1427
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,460
RYAN: Did we establish-- AMY: I'm talking about--

1428
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,179
AMY: Here's what I think I want to do.

1429
01:05:59,179 --> 01:06:00,679
I want to...

1430
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:05,320
(sighs) Rosie's so good at fighting, though.

1431
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,920
KATE: Yeah but she's driving.

1432
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,420
AMY: She's driving. All right. KATE: And I feel like, yeah this guy needs to be enabled.

1433
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:14,000
AMY: What's your-- I don't know-- Amy doesn't know-- What's your primary stat you use for casting stuff?

1434
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,719
KRIS: Oh charisma. AMY: Okay great.

1435
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:17,139
JERRY: Charisma? AMY: So I'm going to...

1436
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,779
AMY: I'm going to lean over the side of the cart.

1437
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,540
And I'm going to reach in between the bars.

1438
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:23,199
KRIS: Ah! AMY: And I'm just going to touch you right on your cheek.

1439
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:24,460
AMY: Like I'm going to give you one of these.

1440
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,960
And do Enhance Ability.

1441
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:28,380
KRIS: Oh! KATE: Oh... !

1442
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,360
AMY: And the one I want to do is your charisma.

1443
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:37,140
So that's Eagle's Splendor. The target has advantage on any checks that would be charisma-based.

1444
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:39,799
KATE: Careful with anything eagle-related with this one, though. JERRY: Yeah.

1445
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,980
AMY: That's in honor of the eagle you murdered last game.

1446
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:42,960
KRIS: Okay. AMY: Just by--

1447
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,840
KRIS: Well I didn't do anything. KATE: Did he really murder it?

1448
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,700
AMY: The goop did. And I hold you responsible for all goop.

1449
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:49,879
JERRY: Yeah, it's like you're tied into this goop thing somehow.

1450
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,119
KRIS: I don't know how. But I'm going to find out, mister.

1451
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:54,599
AMY: That's it. KRIS: So what do I get? I get advantage?

1452
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:57,079
AMY: You get advantage on any charisma-based checks. KATE: Dang.

1453
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,420
KRIS: Oh yeah! KATE: For how long?

1454
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:00,539
AMY: Until I say so! JERRY: 20 days.

1455
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:01,500
KATE: Damn...

1456
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:04,879
KRIS: Touch my cheek more often. AMY: Up to one hour.

1457
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,640
KATE: Okay.

1458
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,180
KRIS: Eagle's Splendor. Okay. I like that.

1459
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:12,480
KATE: I do like the idea of taming these beasts.

1460
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,740
So I'm going to vote for that, but--

1461
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:15,939
KRIS: I'm not built for that.

1462
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,780
That's not what's going to come out.

1463
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,240
KATE: You talk. You can give him an evil whisper.

1464
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:21,699
KATE: Tentacle whisper. AMY: You'll never get the mom.

1465
01:07:21,699 --> 01:07:23,899
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: We're going to have to Bambi this situation.

1466
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,220
RYAN: Or yeah, we can tame it with murder.

1467
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:27,719
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: You're going to have to Bambify?

1468
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:28,739
KATE: Show them what's what.

1469
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:30,299
KRIS: Do the cubs appear stout?

1470
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,039
Would they work without a mother?

1471
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,900
JERRY: No. They're just mewling.

1472
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:40,519
KRIS: I assume that like-- but the mother is smashing itself against-- They're behind...

1473
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:43,940
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're keeping up behind it. KRIS: Okay.

1474
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,159
JERRY: And it's almost like they are...

1475
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:48,319
AMY: Like they're learning how to hunt?

1476
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,139
JERRY: Yeah. I mean that's a good way of putting it actually.

1477
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:54,879
JERRY: They're being trained. KATE: Walnut recognizes this behavior?

1478
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,840
AMY: As having watched all seasons of Planet Earth recently.

1479
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,039
JERRY: Well yeah. And also-- KATE: Walnut's a binger.

1480
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:02,820
JERRY: Exactly. And also being taught to hunt by your own mother.

1481
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,800
AMY: True. JERRY: I think there's a parallel there.

1482
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,100
AMY: Right. KATE: Also elf stuff.

1483
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:08,039
AMY: Also elf stuff. JERRY: Yeah. Also some elven bullshit.

1484
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:09,500
AMY: Sorry. I was just Netflix stuff.

1485
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,019
KRIS: You've thrown yourself on a cart. RYAN: Shark Week.

1486
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:13,039
AMY: Yeah it is Shark Week and you're just going to bud.

1487
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,479
JERRY: Yeah. So you use your turn to confer a buff on K'thriss Drow'b.

1488
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:19,699
AMY: Yeah and I say,

1489
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,619
Listen, we may have to take care of this problem.

1490
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:23,439
Beep.

1491
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,300
KATE: Murderer. KRIS: Okay. So that's a "may have."

1492
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,119
AMY: Hmm. KRIS: I'm trying to give you deference.

1493
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:31,380
Because I'm not going to just throw a bolt at this guy.

1494
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,220
AMY: You can if you want. You can do whatever you want.

1495
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:36,199
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Now, K'thriss Drow'b, it is your turn.

1496
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:37,619
How auspicious.

1497
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:39,719
RYAN: Maybe it's trying to warn us. JERRY: The stars are right.

1498
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,760
RYAN: You don't know it's trying to hurt us. KATE: Yeah that's what I'm saying.

1499
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,400
KRIS: It's trying to communicate with us. RYAN: Yeah.

1500
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:45,339
RYAN: It's saying, hey there's raiders up there.

1501
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:47,439
KATE: The raidings got to cease. JERRY: It's like Lassie?

1502
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:50,039
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: It's like the monstrous version of Lassie?

1503
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:52,380
KRIS: All right. KATE (whispering) Tame the creature!

1504
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,920
KRIS: I'm going to throw a Hex on him-- her.

1505
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:57,000
Which just occurs.

1506
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,000
And what that's going to do...

1507
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:02,659
it's going to take a disadvantage on...

1508
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,639
What would that little fella like?

1509
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,080
What do you think this creature relies upon?

1510
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,860
KATE: Strength? KRIS: Dex... ?

1511
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:12,699
KRIS: It ain't int. Eh it could be.

1512
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:15,679
AMY: I feel like it's got to be strength or dex, right?

1513
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,119
KATE: It seems physical. KRIS: Let's do dex.

1514
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:18,699
JERRY: K.

1515
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:25,119
KRIS: And I, personally, if I attack it will deal an extra 1d6 necrotic.

1516
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,039
However, for my action...

1517
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:34,699
I am going to cast Phantasmal Force to produce an illusion.

1518
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,779
It has to make an intelligence saving throw.

1519
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:40,259
JERRY: Mm-hmm. Unlikely but--

1520
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,960
KRIS: Yeah. Seems like a safe bet.

1521
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:45,800
(sighs) What should I create?

1522
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,520
AMY/KATE: Ooh.

1523
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,980
AMY: Paint me a picture. I want to hear it. KATE: Ooh yeah.

1524
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:51,859
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Tell us. Tell us more, K'thriss Drow'b.

1525
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:52,659
AMY: Yeah!

1526
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:58,780
KRIS: Knowing what I know about this creature and its interests, I...

1527
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,039
hold my focus out the side window there,

1528
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,320
and I produce an incredible looking cart.

1529
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,860
With an even finer horse.

1530
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:09,979
KATE: (whispering) Wow...

1531
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:11,519
JERRY: A juicier horse?

1532
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,780
KRIS: Not-- Yes. It's a beautiful stallion.

1533
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:14,939
KATE: It's a low bar. KRIS: Right.

1534
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:17,000
AMY: A delicious looking-- RYAN: No, you want to make it look--

1535
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,180
RYAN: Yeah you want to make it look weak!

1536
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,579
KATE: But also delicious. RYAN: Animals hunt.

1537
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:22,859
RYAN: They don't go for the strongest in the pack.

1538
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:24,880
KRIS: It's an oblivious, blind horse.

1539
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,600
RYAN: There you go.

1540
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,340
KRIS: Look our horse is not going to feed those cubs.

1541
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,020
You know? You got to bring home the bacon.

1542
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,860
I know it's tough these days for displacer beast.

1543
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,280
AMY: (laughing) Is there like a ticker on the side of the cart?

1544
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:35,759
(laughter)

1545
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,100
KRIS: Not this cart.

1546
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,520
(laughter)

1547
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,000
And fresh-- Yeah it's a cart loaded with raw meat.

1548
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,400
KRIS: I can do that. Let's do that. RYAN: There you go.

1549
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:44,899
KATE: Yeah. Nice. KRIS: That is what I do.

1550
01:10:44,899 --> 01:10:46,819
RYAN: A rickety cart. KRIS: That is what I attempt to do.

1551
01:10:46,819 --> 01:10:48,099
KATE: Rickety cart, blind... KRIS: Does it fail its saving throw?

1552
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,740
RYAN: Rickety cart. Blind, weak horse. KRIS: Do you need my DC?

1553
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:51,460
AMY: Yeah what is it? KRIS: What you need?

1554
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,260
RYAN: Lots of meat. KATE: Juicy, meaty horse.

1555
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,380
JERRY: Yeah what is your spell DC?

1556
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,199
KRIS: 13.

1557
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,460
JERRY: No. No, it does not.

1558
01:10:59,619 --> 01:11:03,479
So is this cart coming on the opposite side of the road?

1559
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,700
KRIS: Is there room for it?

1560
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:09,840
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Basically you're on this side and there could be another cart.

1561
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,319
KRIS: Yeah let's do that. It's a cart full of meat.

1562
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:13,799
And an oblivious horse.

1563
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:15,779
A specifically obliv--

1564
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:17,579
JERRY: A horse reading a magazine! KRIS: Yeah!

1565
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:19,439
KRIS: As it just walks forward.

1566
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:20,299
JERRY: Exactly.

1567
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,300
KRIS: It's always going off the road every once in a while. It's so distracted.

1568
01:11:23,539 --> 01:11:25,579
JERRY: Exactly. You see...

1569
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,275
Because this thing--

1570
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:31,340
It doesn't have a good sense of where your cart even is.

1571
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,579
It's just a good hunter.

1572
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:34,439
KRIS: Right.

1573
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:38,359
JERRY: And so it is slamming itself where it knows there must be something.

1574
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:41,079
This other cart is not like that.

1575
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,800
JERRY: This looks like a regular cart. KRIS: Yeah.

1576
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,359
JERRY: Coming down the other side of the road.

1577
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:50,399
And as it passes your cart,

1578
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:55,299
you see the two pups sort of shimmer in place,

1579
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,820
and then they get distracted by this other cart.

1580
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,960
KRIS: Okay. RYAN: Then we kill the mom.

1581
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,220
RYAN: And the kids don't know and won't hold it against us.

1582
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,860
JERRY: Exactly. RYAN: And we raise them.

1583
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:08,179
JERRY: You raise them as your own.

1584
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,240
KATE: Exactly. KRIS: Right.

1585
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:10,460
KATE: They'll never know.

1586
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,739
KATE: Someday we'll have to tell them they're adopted. KRIS: We keep them in this cart with the old man.

1587
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:15,760
RYAN: Mm-hmm. Have sex with him!

1588
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,579
KRIS: I don't know. That's his thing.

1589
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:18,779
RYAN: I don't know. Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

1590
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:20,139
(laughter)

1591
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,380
JERRY: I've never even heard about it.

1592
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:28,239
So this beast is loping alongside the cart.

1593
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,739
It's already slammed its body into the side.

1594
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,079
It is now...

1595
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:36,979
You can see like serpents, these two tentacles

1596
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:40,279
branch out directly from the shoulder blade

1597
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,100
and then curve forward with these strange patterns at the front.

1598
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,699
You can see that it has, while it's running along the side,

1599
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:52,859
it's just started to bat at the cart with both of them simultaneously.

1600
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,440
KRIS: Oh wow, okay. JERRY: Just reaching out and finding the cart.

1601
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,780
AMY: Was that its turn?

1602
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:02,259
JERRY: Yeah, it's going to attack the cart and deal real damage.

1603
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,460
AMY: No, that's okay, bud.

1604
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,840
KATE: What's the cart's AC?

1605
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,800
JERRY: I'll handle it. I'll handle the AC. AMY: Negative three.

1606
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:15,460
JERRY: So the second one, almost like a cobra in a basket,

1607
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:19,039
just waving and trying to bat at something.

1608
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:24,400
The other tentacle connects pretty firmly with the side.

1609
01:13:24,579 --> 01:13:29,159
And then knocks out a portion of the side of the cart.

1610
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,060
KRIS: Oh in the coach where we're sitting.

1611
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:32,539
KRIS: So it rips more, then. JERRY: Yeah, yeah, so you see it--

1612
01:13:32,539 --> 01:13:33,640
RYAN: So it rips the back of the cart open.

1613
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,440
JERRY: Just like this! Right along the side.

1614
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:38,719
And you can see it within feet of you.

1615
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:43,000
AMY: Great. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. Ah. JERRY: This sort of like starving frond inside there.

1616
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,159
RYAN: So this is Jaws. It just bit the back of the boat.

1617
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,039
JERRY: It's Jaws.

1618
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,760
JERRY: All right. Rosie Beestinger. KRIS: (whispering) It's Jaws.

1619
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,380
KATE: Question. JERRY: What are you going to do?

1620
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:54,460
KATE: Can this beast actually see us or are we still Passing without Trace?

1621
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,199
JERRY: You're still Passing without Trace but it is...

1622
01:13:57,739 --> 01:13:59,099
JERRY: It is... AMY: It's got a hint.

1623
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,960
JERRY: It's hunted before. KRIS: It's forming a map in its mind.

1624
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,199
KATE: Right. So it is tracking us via magical means.

1625
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,639
JERRY: Another system. KATE: So if I were to just throw this cart in reverse, it would know.

1626
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:11,899
KATE: It's not just guessing where we are.

1627
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,939
JERRY: Right now it's actually struck and hit. KATE: Right.

1628
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:18,079
JERRY: So it knows-- Right now it knows.

1629
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:21,059
JERRY: But you could change that pretty easily. KATE: Okay.

1630
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:28,279
KATE: Yeah that's my instinct is that it paced us, and we did not change our pace.

1631
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:30,219
Therefore they did not change their pace.

1632
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,260
JERRY: Oh, ho, ho.

1633
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:36,780
KATE: So my Pass without Trace is on me.

1634
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:40,619
So I'm going to brake Coriander down.

1635
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:45,659
And that's not a problem because she's not a very fast horse.

1636
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:46,599
AMY: Mmm. JERRY: No!

1637
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,740
KATE: She stops immediately and I'm going to try to do a--

1638
01:14:50,739 --> 01:14:52,619
(clicks tongue) Back her up, girl.

1639
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:54,960
And we're going to try to throw this bad boy in reverse.

1640
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,420
JERRY: So you-- RYAN: Aren't they directly behind us?

1641
01:14:57,859 --> 01:15:00,179
KATE: I think it's running on the side. RYAN: Oh. All right.

1642
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:04,260
JERRY: So you basically gear-shift the horse down.

1643
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,840
KATE: Yeah. Get that clutch.

1644
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,579
KATE: (car sounds) Chroom. Beep. Beep. Beep. JERRY: Front is froth.

1645
01:15:10,579 --> 01:15:12,460
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: Spittle.

1646
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,539
JERRY: I mean this horse has been working. KATE: Oh I thought you were talking about me.

1647
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:16,560
JERRY: No. You're fine.

1648
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,359
Please don't do that. Anymore. No, it's fine.

1649
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,920
So you start to brake the speed down.

1650
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,000
And it is continuing to run.

1651
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:35,480
And it's continuing to wave and bat along the side as you see it, basically, running in front of the cart now.

1652
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,500
KATE: Okay.

1653
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,939
JERRY: At a greater rate.

1654
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:42,480
KATE: Okay so it believes that we have outpaced it and it's trying to catch up.

1655
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:45,899
JERRY: Yeah as far as you can tell, it's behaving as though the cart is up there.

1656
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:46,779
RYAN: We won.

1657
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,300
KATE: We won Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

1658
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,640
AMY: Well we got to keep going.

1659
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,140
JERRY: The end. Level one million.

1660
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:52,240
(laughter)

1661
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,700
Donaar Blit'zen.

1662
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,479
RYAN: Ugh now I don't know what to do!

1663
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,940
KATE: Hah! Take that! RYAN: I can't fight the thing. The babies ran away.

1664
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:01,479
JERRY: What was your original plan? RYAN: So nap, I guess?

1665
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:02,859
KRIS: Nothing to fight. Nothing to eat.

1666
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,119
RYAN: Yeah! KRIS: I don't know what to do!

1667
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:05,899
RYAN: I legit don't know what to do.

1668
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:08,699
So it just runs off into the distance and the babies run behind...

1669
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:11,659
KATE: Waelvur's a good time. RYAN: Encounter over. Yeah.

1670
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,720
KRIS: He's good for it. JERRY: Done and dusted.

1671
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,960
RYAN: Um...

1672
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,199
Yeah. I don't...

1673
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:20,019
JERRY: And you cry. KRIS: What would you do?

1674
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:23,680
KRIS: Like, you're not going to be diplomatic with this beast.

1675
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:27,260
RYAN: No! I was going to go at it crazy. But it just ran away.

1676
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,020
It just went doodle-doodle-doo down the road.

1677
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:32,140
KATE: That's true. But it's probably going to be back. So...

1678
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,560
KRIS: You can bring it back with that Duel.

1679
01:16:34,819 --> 01:16:37,119
KATE: You can-- &gt;&gt; RYAN: Compel Duel? AMY: I think I see what you're doing!

1680
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:39,119
RYAN: After we tricked it and be like,

1681
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,180
Hey, dummy! And then, come get some of me! Tough man.

1682
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:46,859
KATE: That is a very Donaar thing to do, though.

1683
01:16:46,859 --> 01:16:48,599
KRIS: It is. Hi!

1684
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,720
JERRY: You leave this invisibility sphere of protection. Hey!

1685
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,420
RYAN: How far away did the babies go? Are they gone?

1686
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:01,539
JERRY: They're not a part of this encounter right now. RYAN: Yeah, so they took off.

1687
01:17:01,539 --> 01:17:04,359
JERRY: They followed this mystical meat wagon. AMY: You saved their life.

1688
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,740
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: I think that would make the mother upset.

1689
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:09,659
RYAN: Yeah! Right? KRIS: Once she noticed.

1690
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:12,599
RYAN: Yeah. She's going to double back for them? AMY: She'll find them. She can track.

1691
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,780
RYAN: Are we trying to skirt past this thing or are we trying to fight this thing?

1692
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:20,199
KATE: It's up to you. You can just pass your turn if you're--

1693
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:21,220
RYAN: Well that's what I'm saying.

1694
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,060
I'm saying if we're trying to be invisible and we're trying to trick it,

1695
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,300
then are we trying just get to the town and we don't want to mess with it?

1696
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:31,199
KATE: Okay our combat apparently has not ended, so there is potentially other stuff for you to do.

1697
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:33,899
RYAN: If I cast Bane on it...

1698
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,020
KATE: Is it within range? JERRY: Yeah what's the range?

1699
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,460
RYAN: 30 feet? How far away did it run?

1700
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:42,420
JERRY: It's probably faster than 30 feet. It's very fast. Just past 30 feet.

1701
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:43,279
RYAN: D'oh.

1702
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,220
JERRY: Whatever you want to do, you can do.

1703
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,180
KATE: Strike a pose and be like--

1704
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:50,259
RYAN: I don't want to fight it. You have to fight it.

1705
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:51,840
All right I'll fight it. You're not allowed to fight it.

1706
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,640
(laughter)

1707
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,900
AMY: But you can save any of this for when it does double back.

1708
01:17:54,899 --> 01:17:57,819
Like the instant it gets back in range you're like, okay I cast Bane.

1709
01:17:57,819 --> 01:17:59,219
KATE: Yeah you can um... What is it? Prepare?

1710
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:04,159
RYAN: Well I mean, if I'm prepping for a fight, who's going to get up in its grill the most?

1711
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,180
RYAN: Probably you? Right. KATE: Probably.

1712
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:09,259
RYAN: So I go over to your little old face.

1713
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,860
And I palm it.

1714
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:12,759
KATE: Uh huh. JERRY: Like a basketball.

1715
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,640
RYAN: Not a gentle like-- I go like-- Yeah. AMY: A lot of face touching in this one.

1716
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,000
KATE: Yeah. RYAN: Yeah and I just give you Shield of Faith.

1717
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,740
KATE: Nice. Shield of face.

1718
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:23,579
RYAN: Yeah. Shield of face. KRIS: I love the caress...

1719
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:26,619
KRIS: And then that. And he's like, that looks good. RYAN: A shimmering field surrounds the creature of your choice--

1720
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,680
RYAN: plus two bonus to AC for duration.

1721
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,240
KATE: Plus two bonus. &gt;&gt; JERRY: Plus two AC. AMY: You got it.

1722
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,180
JERRY: Now... &gt;&gt; KATE: Thank you. RYAN: Concentration so it's the only one I can do.

1723
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:38,500
JERRY: So Waelvur corks his bottle.

1724
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:45,359
Makes sure that it's firmly wrapped up in some leather.

1725
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:52,420
AMY: Sure. JERRY: Grabs a rough plank off the base of the cart.

1726
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,760
JERRY: And tries to hammer it over the hole.

1727
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:56,380
AMY: Oh perfect! KATE: Nice.

1728
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,420
KRIS: Nice.

1729
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,700
RYAN: Oh I want that hole.

1730
01:18:58,699 --> 01:19:00,199
JERRY: And succeeds. KRIS: He knows his carts.

1731
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:01,819
KATE: Succeeds! JERRY: He succeeds.

1732
01:19:01,819 --> 01:19:02,679
AMY: Wow.

1733
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,240
KATE: The cart's in better shape now than it was before. JERRY: Yeah exactly.

1734
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:07,340
JERRY: A couple more rolls like that and you'll have--

1735
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,260
AMY: He also made curtains.

1736
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,739
RYAN: Wait till the acid gets a hold of this cart.

1737
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,280
Because that's what was coming.

1738
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:14,420
I'm going to spit a blast through that hole!

1739
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,260
KRIS: It was like that Nissan Cube for a while.

1740
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,260
JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: Now we just have a dumb cart again.

1741
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,600
KRIS: And that's too bad. JERRY: Now... !

1742
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:20,460
AMY: Uh oh.

1743
01:19:21,619 --> 01:19:22,800
JERRY: Walnut Dankgrass.

1744
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:23,920
AMY: Mmm!

1745
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:29,720
Here's what I'm going to do is I am going to...

1746
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:31,199
KATE: What are you going to do?

1747
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,159
AMY: (sighs)

1748
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:34,539
KRIS: I would like-- RYAN: Bear.

1749
01:19:34,539 --> 01:19:35,680
KRIS: One of your...

1750
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,460
KATE: Finest...

1751
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:41,000
AMY: Well I was wondering if maybe I wanted to get all like--

1752
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,440
Because I can like...

1753
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:46,400
basically just web all over the place, and then it's in my web.

1754
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:47,960
KRIS: Oh. KATE: Oh yeah! Web it!

1755
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:51,439
RYAN: Yeah. So we stopped. Right?

1756
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:52,319
KATE: Yeah, we're-- RYAN: Or did we just slow down?

1757
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,979
KATE: We stopped, and I got us backing up very slowly.

1758
01:19:54,979 --> 01:19:56,659
RYAN: We should just, yeah, build a little trap.

1759
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:57,439
KRIS: (whispering) Yeah.

1760
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,059
RYAN: Like dig a hole and then cover it with leaves. KATE: (singing) Built a little trap! Build a little trap!

1761
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,080
(laughter)

1762
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:05,279
KATE: Sharpen your toothbrush and put it at the bottom?

1763
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:06,239
KRIS: Oh yeah! AMY: Just one toothbrush?

1764
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,439
RYAN: Yeah. My sword, she means.

1765
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:08,479
AMY: Okay so...

1766
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:12,100
Good god... I don't want to...

1767
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,579
I really want to wait for it to come back.

1768
01:20:15,939 --> 01:20:16,839
JERRY: You can.

1769
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:21,259
AMY: Yeah. Okay, I'm going to-- RYAN: Your little cart move slowed down all the action.

1770
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,100
RYAN: Now we're all like, I don't know what to do.

1771
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,579
AMY: Well it's just like-- KATE: You're welcome.

1772
01:20:24,579 --> 01:20:25,680
AMY: Yeah no, I think it's great.

1773
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,500
I'm just thinking maybe we can actually sneak past it.

1774
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,920
That it's possible to avoid combat in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

1775
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,859
Believe it or not.

1776
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:33,119
JERRY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: You can try. AMY: People do it.

1777
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,800
AMY: So I'm going to-- RYAN: When do we cash in our accounts?

1778
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,760
RYAN: This is what we were hired to do, though, right?

1779
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,900
KATE: No, I don't think-- This is not The Raiding Must Cease.

1780
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:42,639
We haven't even talked to Lord Vizguard...

1781
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:46,140
KATE: Wagon... Cartinwheel. AMY: This is not a one-episode arc.

1782
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,820
RYAN: I thought people were confused.

1783
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:50,359
They thought people were being raided but it was actually this monster.

1784
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:51,900
JERRY: Yeah.

1785
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,740
KATE: What? He got it right?

1786
01:20:53,739 --> 01:20:54,479
JERRY: No. RYAN: Oh.

1787
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,539
JERRY: But-- AMY: But it's a theory.

1788
01:20:56,539 --> 01:20:58,239
JERRY: I support that 100%.

1789
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,739
KRIS: We don't know what this thing is capable of.

1790
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:02,599
It might also be a bandit.

1791
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,280
AMY: I'm going to wait to wild shape until it gets within, we'll say 30 feet.

1792
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:07,319
JERRY: Within the wild shape zone?

1793
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:07,939
AMY: Yeah.

1794
01:21:07,939 --> 01:21:11,619
Within the zone of my combat anxiety where I'm like,

1795
01:21:11,619 --> 01:21:12,920
Okay! Now I got to be an animal.

1796
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,079
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: Exactly.

1797
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:15,359
JERRY: Okay now. KATE: Don't make me be an animal.

1798
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:16,880
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. KATE: Don't let me get my zone.

1799
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,960
AMY: Don't let me get my zone... JERRY: What is your action?

1800
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,199
KATE: (whispering) Definitely get in my zone.

1801
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:22,960
KRIS: What action shall you take, young man?

1802
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,699
Gosh.

1803
01:21:24,699 --> 01:21:27,800
If we're just hanging out, kind of want to see what it does.

1804
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,119
KATE: Yeah. RYAN: Nap.

1805
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:31,199
KATE: You're just academically curious? AMY: Make a drink.

1806
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:32,739
RYAN: What about the cart?

1807
01:21:32,739 --> 01:21:34,399
KATE: You're sketching the displacer beast.

1808
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:40,099
KRIS: Yeah. As my action I compliment Waelvur on his wagonsmanship.

1809
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:40,760
(laughter)

1810
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,340
KRIS: It is well built.

1811
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:43,779
Real quick.

1812
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,079
Amazingly done.

1813
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:49,720
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. He's just absentmindedly just give it a couple quick taps.

1814
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,800
Looking at it.

1815
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,840
Couple of quick taps.

1816
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:55,600
JERRY: He's a perfectionist, clearly. KRIS: He loves his work. Yeah.

1817
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,100
AMY: I really appreciate that you're not afraid to just completely give up a turn and just be like,

1818
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,280
See what happens. I don't know.

1819
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:02,059
KRIS: I think that-- AMY: Whatever. Roleplay.

1820
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:03,220
KRIS: It's not-- I have--

1821
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,240
The only things I can do is bring that thing back.

1822
01:22:05,239 --> 01:22:07,199
If I can even reach it. Well I can reach it.

1823
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,380
KATE: I could reach it but I won't--

1824
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,420
KRIS: I could kill it, but I won't. RYAN: Yeah, you're controlling the cart, so...

1825
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,220
KATE: Yeah.

1826
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:15,039
RYAN: You have to vary our speed if we want to not engage it.

1827
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:17,500
KATE: Do we see-- Has it turned-- So it's turned back. JERRY: Yep. Yeah.

1828
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,979
KRIS: This is its turn now. JERRY: It has.

1829
01:22:18,979 --> 01:22:20,479
JERRY: It has come back.

1830
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:26,159
It has turned and is--

1831
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:29,380
It's like the traditional jousting set up.

1832
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:32,439
Here is your cart, except you are not visible to it.

1833
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:40,279
And here is this creature coming down the road directly at the cart.

1834
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:44,920
Just sort of sweeping the air in front of it with its tentacles.

1835
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,840
JERRY: Just trying to find-- KATE: Trying to find us?

1836
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,600
JERRY: Trying to find you.

1837
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,260
KRIS: What kind of reach does it have on those--

1838
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,579
How long abouts do they look?

1839
01:22:51,579 --> 01:22:53,739
JERRY It's pretty substantial.

1840
01:22:53,739 --> 01:22:55,840
KRIS: 80 feet. RYAN: Like a linguine noodle.

1841
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,319
AMY: Linguine!

1842
01:22:57,319 --> 01:22:59,039
JERRY: No. Ten feet. KRIS: Okay.

1843
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:01,720
JERRY: It's-- AMY: Good linguine!

1844
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,539
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. It's a lot. It's thick. It's fresh.

1845
01:23:04,539 --> 01:23:05,979
KRIS: Wow. KATE: That's-a good linguine.

1846
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:08,119
KRIS: Al dente. JERRY: Dark linguine.

1847
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:10,599
KATE: May it be my turn?

1848
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,060
JERRY: It is now Rosie Beestinger's turn, that's great. KATE: Wonderful.

1849
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,119
KATE: I would like to cast Minor Illusion.

1850
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:19,319
At its maximum range which is 30 feet.

1851
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:22,139
I would cast it far behind us.

1852
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,100
I will stop the cart. Cast it.

1853
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:30,080
And the Minor Illusion will be the sound and image of its baby crying.

1854
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:32,559
KRIS: Ooh yes. KATE: I don't know what that sounds like but I just--

1855
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,420
I'm like, whatever the most horrible noise that I can think of--

1856
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,859
JERRY: You did hear it. KATE: I did hear it, so I do know what it sounds like.

1857
01:23:37,859 --> 01:23:38,960
RYAN: Yeah you heard them mewling. KATE: Mewling!

1858
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,539
KATE: Okay I'm going to amp that up so that it sounds like distress.

1859
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:44,680
KATE: So I'm going to cast-- RYAN: Maximum mewl.

1860
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,760
KATE: And I'm going to stay super still and hope that it freaks out and we can just book it.

1861
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,340
Coriander can go max speed.

1862
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,579
AMY: Oh Coriander.

1863
01:23:52,279 --> 01:23:54,219
KRIS: Who's been witnessing this entire thing. JERRY: Ugh.

1864
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,560
JERRY: No. KRIS: This is an ancient horse.

1865
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,960
KATE: That's not a thing? JERRY: That is not good.

1866
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,520
JERRY: I had not even have to fudge it for dramatic purposes.

1867
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,760
KATE: Uh oh. KRIS: (gasps)

1868
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,239
JERRY: It was actually a very bad roll.

1869
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,779
So when that sound hits...

1870
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:09,500
just this sort of keen mewl--

1871
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,300
like a two-tone mewl.

1872
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,619
You see the-- before it's been seeking and like actively looking.

1873
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:18,260
Now they start to writhe...

1874
01:24:19,899 --> 01:24:21,139
in midair.

1875
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:25,940
It leaves the road all together.

1876
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,679
And sort of casts a wide berth.

1877
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:31,960
And...

1878
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,319
(stammering) The actual creature.

1879
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:35,659
You simulated the creature itself, right? Or is it just the sound?

1880
01:24:35,659 --> 01:24:37,019
KATE: Both. Yeah. JERRY: Yeah.

1881
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:43,239
JERRY: It leaves the road, still seeking with the fronds,

1882
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:47,000
and just makes a beeline back for this creature.

1883
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,659
KATE: Great. JERRY: And it's awful.

1884
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:52,939
JERRY: Because as it gets close--

1885
01:24:52,939 --> 01:24:54,599
First of all it can only see one.

1886
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,980
KATE: Ah. KRIS: Oh.

1887
01:24:55,979 --> 01:25:01,659
JERRY: Then as it brings these tentacles together around it,

1888
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,680
passes directly through.

1889
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,260
KRIS: (whispering) Oh! No...

1890
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,100
KATE: I created a mother's nightmare!

1891
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,880
RYAN: Yeah. That was good. JERRY: Donaar.

1892
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:15,199
RYAN: I say, hurry the cart up!

1893
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,720
(laughter)

1894
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,380
KRIS: As my action I yell at you.

1895
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:21,060
RYAN: As my action I say, good job! Let's go!

1896
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,000
KATE: Do you want to jump on and maybe drive the cart?

1897
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:24,500
RYAN: Yeah, I guess. KATE: Yeah, do that.

1898
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,439
RYAN: How big am I?

1899
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:27,339
RYAN: Can I get through the cart? KATE: You're very big. You're a big boy.

1900
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,960
RYAN: Is there like a barrier to the front?

1901
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,079
KRIS: Maybe you can reach through the window and pull the reins.

1902
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:32,720
RYAN: That's what I'm saying. Yeah! AMY: You're like, I won't be outside for this.

1903
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,980
RYAN: Just like push my arms through. Hyah!

1904
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:36,259
JERRY: It covers--

1905
01:25:36,579 --> 01:25:37,800
The Pass without Trace covers--

1906
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,500
JERRY: You can come around back. RYAN: Oh okay yeah.

1907
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,079
RYAN: We'll have time. That's right. I keep forgetting about that. All right, yeah.

1908
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:44,899
JERRY: Yeah. So the sound is horrible.

1909
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,520
Like the wailing from this creature.

1910
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,320
AMY: Great.

1911
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:51,539
JERRY: Yeah. This is the campaign's about, I guess.

1912
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:55,099
RYAN: Yeah, so I get old Coriander going.

1913
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,720
JERRY: Yeah. You gun it. RYAN: Giddyup.

1914
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,680
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Maybe Coriander would like a Goodberry.

1915
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:02,900
AMY: Do it.

1916
01:26:02,899 --> 01:26:04,279
RYAN: I'm out of actions. KRIS: Not your turn.

1917
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:07,179
RYAN: My action was to go up there and go, hyah.

1918
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:07,940
KATE: All right.

1919
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,640
JERRY: We can...

1920
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:12,819
Goodberries can be fed to horses. I mean I want to make sure...

1921
01:26:12,819 --> 01:26:14,639
RYAN/KATE: All right. AMY/KATE: Yeah.

1922
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,579
AMY: Wait! Are you asking me? JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

1923
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:17,920
KRIS: Lethal to horses.

1924
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,319
AMY: (sighs) My god... KRIS: The only animal that cannot eat a Goodberry.

1925
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:21,380
JERRY: It's your turn. AMY: A creature...

1926
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:22,260
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: Nice.

1927
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,119
AMY: can use its action to eat one berry.

1928
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:26,680
RYAN: Oh is Coriander a creature? Hmm.

1929
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,900
KRIS: Did it roll initiative? (laughter)

1930
01:26:28,899 --> 01:26:31,779
JERRY: It's like these creatures eat fruit. I mean you seen--

1931
01:26:31,779 --> 01:26:33,079
AMY: Yeah sure.

1932
01:26:33,079 --> 01:26:34,899
RYAN: I could lay on hands the thing too.

1933
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,579
KRIS: Don't waste it.

1934
01:26:36,579 --> 01:26:38,100
JERRY: So you... AMY: Don't waste that.

1935
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:42,280
JERRY: You've instructed this beast...

1936
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:47,300
to move along the road toward Westbridge.

1937
01:26:47,859 --> 01:26:52,739
And then you see the displacer beast behind the cart...

1938
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,900
AMY: (whispering) It has a name!

1939
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:55,779
JERRY: look back.

1940
01:26:56,260 --> 01:27:01,239
And just sort of scanning the area, trying to find you.

1941
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:07,000
And then it has other concerns, apparently, and it sees to them.

1942
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,460
AMY: (Final Fantasy VII battle victory music)

1943
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,720
KRIS: XP, zero. RYAN: Yeah.

1944
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,539
(laughter)

1945
01:27:11,539 --> 01:27:12,899
AMY: Aww yeah.

1946
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:14,319
JERRY: No, it's... RYAN: We did it.

1947
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:16,920
JERRY: That's not how it works anymore. AMY: But we experienced... life.

1948
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,380
KATE: That's right. AMY: And that's the most important thing.

1949
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:20,340
JERRY: That's not how it works anymore. KATE: The real XP you gained was friendship.

1950
01:27:20,619 --> 01:27:23,019
JERRY: So! It's like this...

1951
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:27,279
You enter the town of Westbridge.

1952
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,860
And the cart is not in the best shape.

1953
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:33,839
KATE: Was it ever though?

1954
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,960
JERRY: No, but it is, arguably, in even worse shape than it was before.

1955
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:44,480
Waelvur knows of a place in town.

1956
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:46,000
KATE: Not Thelorn's though.

1957
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,460
JERRY: (stammering) Don't even bring up Thelorn's Safe--

1958
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,939
Don't even bring up Thelorn.

1959
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:51,699
KATE: I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1960
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:54,859
JERRY: As a dungeon master, like out of game,

1961
01:27:54,859 --> 01:27:59,099
do not bring up Thelorn with Waelvur.

1962
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,380
KATE: I'm sorry. I didn't say it in character. I said it out of character.

1963
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,659
JERRY: It's going to be a thing. KATE: I would never mention it. Okay.

1964
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:05,819
JERRY: So...

1965
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:08,099
KRIS: So potent that even out of character he's...

1966
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,420
JERRY: Ugh! KRIS: Something!

1967
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:11,619
AMY: The voice is screaming.

1968
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:15,800
JERRY: But he knows of a place called the Harvest Inn.

1969
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:19,400
That's run by what he calls "a strange man."

1970
01:28:20,819 --> 01:28:22,539
But the beds are good.

1971
01:28:22,539 --> 01:28:23,699
And the food is good.

1972
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:26,720
He says that some of the art is... not good.

1973
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:28,300
JERRY: But... KATE: Hmm...

1974
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,600
JERRY: But you know, that's not why you stay at an inn. So...

1975
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,000
KATE: Maybe not you. JERRY: Yeah.

1976
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:33,560
(laughter)

1977
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,460
KRIS: So deep!

1978
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,539
RYAN: Wow! KRIS: Learned a lot.

1979
01:28:35,539 --> 01:28:39,119
JERRY: Waelvur agrees to sleep out in the cart.

1980
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:41,260
You think that that's a normal thing for him.

1981
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:51,039
And he busies himself doing some finishing work on the cart so that it can survive the rest of this trip.

1982
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:51,899
KATE: Nice.

1983
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,140
KRIS: I just thought he was painting it or something.

1984
01:28:55,359 --> 01:28:56,539
JERRY: No. Exactly. So--

1985
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:57,519
KATE: Gilding it.

1986
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,220
JERRY: It's near the end of the day.

1987
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:01,060
It's starting to get dark.

1988
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:06,640
You see people are getting to their inns of choice.

1989
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:08,859
Settling in for the evening.

1990
01:29:10,739 --> 01:29:12,039
As the...

1991
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,920
Hoardsperson...

1992
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,480
you should subtract six gold.

1993
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:21,579
KRIS: Okay.

1994
01:29:21,579 --> 01:29:24,899
JERRY: It's not the best place, but it's not the worst place.

1995
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:26,439
There's some kind of a premium.

1996
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:29,339
Probably because of where it's situated on the Long Road.

1997
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,320
Maybe it's vacation prices.

1998
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,560
Who knows?

1999
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,620
AMY: Surge pricing on the Harvest Inn? JERRY: Exactly!

2000
01:29:35,619 --> 01:29:38,460
JERRY: At the Harvest Inn. You look down at your app.

2001
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:43,320
So you can sort of see what he means.

2002
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:48,299
You decide to take a quick meal downstairs before you retire for the night.

2003
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,400
And you can sort of see what Waelvur's talking about in terms of the art.

2004
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:53,719
There's a lot of...

2005
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:56,279
sort of amorphous...

2006
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,880
half spheres.

2007
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,640
There's definitely a visual theme.

2008
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:06,859
But it's hard to really perceive exactly what they're going for here.

2009
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:07,579
AMY: Hmm...

2010
01:30:07,579 --> 01:30:09,439
KRIS: This is art on the walls, or this is actually--

2011
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:12,139
JERRY: These are-- He has some paintings.

2012
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:17,119
But most of what he has are sculptures of different kinds.

2013
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:18,880
KATE: Amorphous half spheres?

2014
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,020
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: Like-- Like nuts?

2015
01:30:21,399 --> 01:30:23,379
JERRY: Well-- &gt;&gt; KATE: It's not like-- KRIS: Take it easy, Rosie.

2016
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,079
JERRY: No, no. &gt;&gt; KATE: (laughing) What? AMY: That's our word.

2017
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:28,039
JERRY: No, no, no. It's odd.

2018
01:30:28,039 --> 01:30:29,399
But you hear sort of a--

2019
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:32,299
As your plates come,

2020
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:37,360
JERRY: you hear sort of a hush in the room. KATE: (whispering) Like walnuts. Acorn.

2021
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:42,019
JERRY: And then you can see a man.

2022
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:45,960
Very proud, obviously, of what he is about to do.

2023
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,180
He sort of strides by tables.

2024
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,980
Touches people on the shoulders.

2025
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:53,619
Says, "Thanks for coming tonight."

2026
01:30:53,619 --> 01:30:54,659
KRIS: (laughs)

2027
01:30:54,659 --> 01:30:56,199
JERRY: Right? AMY: (sighs)

2028
01:30:56,199 --> 01:31:01,639
He approaches in the center of this room are two daises.

2029
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,840
One of them is empty.

2030
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:08,579
And then the second one has a sheet of blue silk on it.

2031
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:14,319
And he smiles at the crowd and says,

2032
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,100
"You're welcome."

2033
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,079
And he pulls off this silk sheet.

2034
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:23,260
And you think it's just a sculpture of an ass.

2035
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:28,199
You think that it is someone's butt.

2036
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:32,920
And when you look at the other pieces...

2037
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,920
you think that...

2038
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:36,599
you think that...

2039
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:38,259
he just has sculpt--

2040
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,760
you think that all of his sculptures are just--

2041
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:41,800
(pencil clattering)

2042
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:43,599
JERRY: of butts.

2043
01:31:43,899 --> 01:31:45,899
KATE: You laughed at me when-- RYAN: I "apploud laudly".

2044
01:31:45,899 --> 01:31:46,679
(laughter)

2045
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,460
RYAN: I clap. Say, magnificent!

2046
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,640
JERRY: He points at you. He's like...

2047
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:55,260
KRIS: My man! KATE: Donaar finally understands art for the first time in his life.

2048
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,539
KATE: I get it!

2049
01:31:56,539 --> 01:31:59,000
JERRY: But it's like-- AMY: Well he likes portraits of himself.

2050
01:31:59,000 --> 01:31:59,939
RYAN: I'm a prince.

2051
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:01,519
KATE: (laughs) JERRY: Bam!

2052
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,680
RYAN: I don't get it. KATE: Falcon swoops in!

2053
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:06,780
JERRY: But it's like halfling ass...

2054
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:08,019
RYAN: Yeah!

2055
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:08,980
JERRY: Elven ass...

2056
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:14,219
Like it's just a panoply of asses.

2057
01:32:14,439 --> 01:32:16,199
There's an aasimar ass.

2058
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:17,760
There's a genasi ass.

2059
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:18,960
KRIS: My god! JERRY: It's like...

2060
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,220
KATE: Panoply of asses...

2061
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:21,699
JERRY: He is... AMY: Butts all the way down.

2062
01:32:21,699 --> 01:32:23,639
JERRY: He is-- Butts from top to bottom.

2063
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:28,579
He is overjoyed at the collection he has managed to...

2064
01:32:28,579 --> 01:32:29,699
AMY: Is that the harvest?

2065
01:32:29,699 --> 01:32:32,300
JERRY: Yeah. A butt harvest? KATE: An ass harvest.

2066
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,000
JERRY: So he... KRIS: Harvest Moon!

2067
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,779
JERRY: But there's something that bothers him...

2068
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,340
You can tell like this is supposed to be--

2069
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:41,500
Like it's a moment of triumph.

2070
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:46,779
And obviously he's received appreciation from those who with the taste...

2071
01:32:46,779 --> 01:32:49,039
JERRY: The curatorial-- RYAN: It's called pomo. All right?

2072
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:50,239
RYAN: Sorry you don't get it.

2073
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:53,340
JERRY: The curatorial tastes to appreciate it.

2074
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:56,920
But you can see his hand sort of like...

2075
01:32:57,479 --> 01:33:00,379
wants to slide over the empty dais.

2076
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:04,599
And he gives it a couple quick pats.

2077
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:08,340
And then you can see him turn towards your table,

2078
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:11,520
and you can see a single tear come out. And he just...

2079
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:14,460
He wipes it and just-- (sniffs)

2080
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:17,480
KRIS: (laughs) AMY: What's happening?

2081
01:33:17,479 --> 01:33:18,519
KRIS: Oh man!

2082
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,260
I don't feel like we need to do persuasion on this.

2083
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:24,840
He's ready to spill on this tale!

2084
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,100
JERRY: Do you want to engage him?

2085
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:28,920
KRIS: Friend...

2086
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,159
AMY: Everyone's your friend. RYAN: Yeah, everyone's your friend.

2087
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:32,300
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, exactly. "Friend."

2088
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,680
KRIS: Friend. I couldn't help but notice your emotion.

2089
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:42,020
You've created so many... beautiful figures here. And...

2090
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:43,240
JERRY: "Yes." KRIS: And yet--

2091
01:33:43,239 --> 01:33:44,420
JERRY: "Yes." KRIS: And yet!

2092
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:45,399
KATE: And yet...

2093
01:33:45,399 --> 01:33:48,719
KRIS: And yet surrounded by beauty, you feel pain.

2094
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,659
JERRY: He says...

2095
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:53,520
"The alto."

2096
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:55,800
"The tenor."

2097
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,020
"The bass."

2098
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:00,679
"But my soprano..."

2099
01:34:02,619 --> 01:34:10,680
And he gestures just weakly, limply at the empty dais.

2100
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,659
He says,

2101
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:18,460
"There are shipments that have been going missing."

2102
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:20,980
"On the road east of here."

2103
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:26,500
"One of them included my soprano."

2104
01:34:26,899 --> 01:34:29,519
"I think I know who is doing it!"

2105
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:31,660
"I have..."

2106
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:34,300
"Let's say it."

2107
01:34:34,859 --> 01:34:37,000
"A competitor in this space."

2108
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:44,359
"A competitor that traffics in profane works."

2109
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:47,899
"Sir!"

2110
01:34:48,279 --> 01:34:55,420
"I want to describe for you one of the statues in their collection."

2111
01:34:56,159 --> 01:35:01,420
"This is a statue that is sold for more than 400 gold."

2112
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,500
"It is a boy..."

2113
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,840
"who pees!"

2114
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,140
AMY: (laughs)

2115
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,380
KATE: That's it?

2116
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,780
KRIS: Disgusting.

2117
01:35:15,579 --> 01:35:24,260
JERRY: "I think that there is a gulf between the work on display at the Harvest Inn..."

2118
01:35:24,619 --> 01:35:34,019
"and the sort of material one might find from a Pragma Cleft."

2119
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,520
"Subpar."

2120
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,319
"Urine-oriented."

2121
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:43,020
"Not good!"

2122
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,660
KRIS: Oh dear. Oh dear! I say.

2123
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:50,019
Dreadful.

2124
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,039
Scandalous.

2125
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:54,359
JERRY: "So what brings you to the Harvest Inn?"

2126
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,380
"Well, what else?"

2127
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:59,079
KRIS: (laughs)

2128
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:07,840
We actually have been sent on a task to undo the raids on these roads.

2129
01:36:08,979 --> 01:36:10,639
KRIS: If we find them-- JERRY: "Is that so?"

2130
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:15,300
KRIS: it might be possible to recover your prized piece.

2131
01:36:15,779 --> 01:36:16,960
JERRY: "The soprano..."

2132
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:18,880
KRIS: The very same.

2133
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,180
RYAN: (laughs)

2134
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,760
JERRY: "You will know it by sight!"

2135
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:23,720
KRIS: I imagine we will.

2136
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,140
(laughter)

2137
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,300
KATE: No doubt.

2138
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:29,879
JERRY: "It is of a piece with my current theme."

2139
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,320
KRIS: Keep an eye out for that.

2140
01:36:35,319 --> 01:36:37,340
JERRY: "Were you to return that to me..."

2141
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:40,960
"I am certain..."

2142
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:45,480
"I can find some means of compensation."

2143
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:51,639
KATE: Uh-- KRIS: It is done!

2144
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,079
KATE: But-- Well... let's talk brass tacks here.

2145
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:56,720
So what kinds of compensation are we-- No? You know?

2146
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,039
KRIS: No, no, no. Yeah, no. Let's do that.

2147
01:36:58,039 --> 01:36:59,479
KATE: (laughs)

2148
01:36:59,659 --> 01:37:03,000
KRIS: I don't want to over-promise. AMY: I don't want to be-- Yeah, I lean to Donaar and I go,

2149
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,479
AMY: I don't want to be compensated with a butt!

2150
01:37:05,479 --> 01:37:06,579
(laughter)

2151
01:37:06,579 --> 01:37:07,279
RYAN: I don't know.

2152
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:08,639
KATE: I have a feeling-- (laughter)

2153
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:12,100
KATE: I have a feeling it'll be butt-themed. RYAN: I don't know. I feel like he's got good taste.

2154
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,480
KATE: And I'd rather have gold.

2155
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,079
Or a better cart.

2156
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:17,560
At this juncture.

2157
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:21,960
RYAN: What if we get butt decorations in the cart? KRIS: We get a butt; we sell a butt. It's not a big deal.

2158
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:23,659
AMY: Do you know art dealers? KRIS: Apparently it's in demand.

2159
01:37:23,659 --> 01:37:24,739
KATE: Do you know a butt fence?

2160
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:27,500
AMY: Although it may be-- KRIS: There must be many of them in this area.

2161
01:37:27,819 --> 01:37:31,960
AMY: It might make our base look more... official.

2162
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,659
RYAN: Make our base a home.

2163
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:35,739
RYAN: You know? AMY: It could really tie the room together.

2164
01:37:35,739 --> 01:37:37,779
KRIS: Look great on that shelf. AMY: I've come around on this butt thing.

2165
01:37:37,779 --> 01:37:39,559
(laughter)

2166
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,600
AMY: Walnut doesn't understand the trappings of civilized people.

2167
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,600
She's like, I mean it seems good?

2168
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,600
KRIS/KATE: This is what they do! KATE/KRIS/AMY: Yes!

2169
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:49,400
AMY: This is like fancy plates on the wall and butts in your house.

2170
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:51,059
JERRY: Exactly. KATE: All right. All right.

2171
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:54,480
KRIS: Yeah, I-- JERRY: So you're like, eh.

2172
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,020
(laughter)

2173
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:59,880
KRIS: Yeah are you the only one in our group that would actually take issue?

2174
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:02,859
Because I feel like I'm not from the surface world,

2175
01:38:02,859 --> 01:38:04,779
KRIS: so I'm not sure. JERRY: So you're like, "Okay. Butts."

2176
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:08,179
AMY: We're like Ariel with the fork. We're like, okay...

2177
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,060
JERRY: It's the dinglehopper, right? AMY: Yeah exactly.

2178
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:11,180
KATE: And Donaar just likes butts.

2179
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:13,180
AMY: And Donaar thinks it's great art, so I'm like... RYAN: I'm a fan of the art.

2180
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,180
AMY: Okay. KATE: So I'm the only one who's like...

2181
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:17,520
JERRY: It's like granny. Right?

2182
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,260
KATE: Yeah. Yeah. Little old lady. JERRY: Mmm...

2183
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,220
KATE: She's like-- (stammering)

2184
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,720
Okay. Sure.

2185
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,840
If it makes you happy, let's do it.

2186
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,960
RYAN: When we get back to the base,

2187
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:30,060
we take that big, old painting of the kids off the mantle

2188
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:33,039
and we put this butt picture there.

2189
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:34,380
KRIS: Yes! JERRY: Done!

2190
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,800
JERRY: Clean! AMY: We don't even know if we're getting a butt, but...

2191
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,640
RYAN: Now I demand it. I say...

2192
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,440
(stammering) There better be butt art!

2193
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:42,799
KATE: The only thing we will accept is butt art.

2194
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:43,980
JERRY: You pay me in any other way...

2195
01:38:43,979 --> 01:38:44,659
So...

2196
01:38:46,439 --> 01:38:49,619
You scrape the last bits of food from the plates.

2197
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:53,079
Room's comfortable.

2198
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:54,180
Warm. Dry.

2199
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,079
Voices begin to die down downstairs.

2200
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,940
You wake in the morning.

2201
01:39:01,399 --> 01:39:03,139
Waelvur is not awake.

2202
01:39:03,619 --> 01:39:04,659
But the cart...

2203
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:08,579
KRIS: Is on fire. JERRY: No.

2204
01:39:08,579 --> 01:39:09,559
(laughter)

2205
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,720
JERRY: The cart is a heap of ashes.

2206
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:16,439
No. The cart-- You got to say, honestly...

2207
01:39:16,739 --> 01:39:18,340
giving it a quick once over,

2208
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:21,119
you think it's in better shape than when you first got it.

2209
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:22,079
RYAN: Eyy.

2210
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:23,659
KATE: Nice. JERRY: It has a little more spring in its step.

2211
01:39:23,659 --> 01:39:24,500
KRIS: Waelvur!

2212
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:27,199
JERRY: One of the wheels has been replaced.

2213
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:29,579
You don't know where the wheel came from.

2214
01:39:29,579 --> 01:39:31,399
RYAN: Syphon gas from another cart.

2215
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:32,399
(laughter) JERRY: Right?

2216
01:39:33,399 --> 01:39:37,819
But you are now ready to leave Westbridge

2217
01:39:38,579 --> 01:39:42,559
via the Stone Road and head toward where the "raids..."

2218
01:39:43,619 --> 01:39:46,039
are currently going on but must cease...

2219
01:39:46,539 --> 01:39:50,560
if you are to satisfy the letter of the law of your requirements.

2220
01:39:51,539 --> 01:39:53,600
AMY: Three of your berries expire.

2221
01:39:53,739 --> 01:39:54,539
RYAN: Oh!

2222
01:39:54,539 --> 01:39:55,760
JERRY: They expire berries?

2223
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,760
RYAN: Wait I had four. Now how many do I have?

2224
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,420
KRIS: What if I eat it anyway? What would happen? AMY: You keep track. I'm telling you--

2225
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:03,920
KATE: The ones you made the first day. So we made them, we ate one, so two?

2226
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:04,739
AMY: So two expire. KATE: Okay.

2227
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:07,979
KATE: Everything from the first day. AMY: I replace them with two, so your math is fine.

2228
01:40:07,979 --> 01:40:10,879
KATE: Okay. AMY: And then I'm going to give one to Coriander.

2229
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,020
KATE: Nice, nice. AMY: And keep the rest for myself.

2230
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:14,260
JERRY: All right. KATE: Okay.

2231
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:15,530
JERRY: Right. So...

2232
01:40:15,529 --> 01:40:19,539
Like I say, Waelvur tip-tapped apparently through the night.

2233
01:40:20,779 --> 01:40:21,899
Gentleman's tuckered.

2234
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:23,339
AMY: Oh I give him one too.

2235
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:24,820
Whoops.

2236
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:26,260
Humans!

2237
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,140
JERRY: You just put it on his lips.

2238
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:29,640
RYAN: Pry it out of the horse's mouth.

2239
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,460
(laughter) JERRY: No! No.

2240
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:34,140
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: I split it like an apple. No, I don't do that.

2241
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:36,880
RYAN: Then put it in his mouth. And then you hold his mouth shut and rub his throat.

2242
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,060
(laughter)

2243
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,039
What is happening?

2244
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:40,319
JERRY: You get the-- (warbling sounds)

2245
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:41,840
RYAN: I fix the cart -- (warbling sounds)

2246
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,220
KATE: Coriander's shoulders just like slumped.

2247
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,579
She was like, so close.

2248
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,640
AMY: No, I fed her. I fed her. JERRY: Yeah, she's fed.

2249
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,539
KRIS: K good.

2250
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:52,720
JERRY: So you head out in the bustle of the morning town.

2251
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:57,000
You head out the east road there.

2252
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,979
KATE: Are there any shops with provisions we might want to stop in before we head out?

2253
01:40:59,979 --> 01:41:01,119
JERRY: East from Westbridge--

2254
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:04,960
Yeah, yeah. Typically at the edges of towns like this you can always find something. What are you looking for?

2255
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,460
KATE: I don't know. Raiding must cease.

2256
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:11,600
So we got any kind of healing herbs or potions?

2257
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,720
KATE: Or other things we might stock up on? KRIS: We got Goodberries aplenty.

2258
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,659
KATE: Well Goodberry heals one hit point.

2259
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:19,939
KATE: I'm not saying it's not enough. RYAN: Oh really? Oh.

2260
01:41:19,939 --> 01:41:21,139
KATE: I'm just saying... AMY: It is just one HP.

2261
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:22,539
RYAN: I thought it was like a senzu bean.

2262
01:41:22,539 --> 01:41:24,359
AMY: No. KATE: It's like a little edamame.

2263
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,700
KRIS: An amuse-bouche.

2264
01:41:25,699 --> 01:41:27,920
AMY: (laughing) It is an amuse-bouche.

2265
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:33,180
No and I took off any other healing spells that I might have because I just assumed--

2266
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:36,940
Originally when we made this party, Ryan said at one point, I could have heals.

2267
01:41:37,079 --> 01:41:37,979
RYAN: I do have heals!

2268
01:41:37,979 --> 01:41:38,899
KATE: He has heals. AMY: Then there we go!

2269
01:41:38,899 --> 01:41:39,960
RYAN: Not a lot of them!

2270
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:41,460
KATE: Right. AMY: Well we're only level three.

2271
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,859
AMY: There's only so many HP to lose and gain.

2272
01:41:43,859 --> 01:41:45,000
RYAN: That's true.

2273
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,619
KATE: Famous last words. I will still pick up some potions.

2274
01:41:47,619 --> 01:41:50,559
JERRY: Okay. KATE: I have some gold that I picked up off a dead guy...

2275
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:53,559
KATE: that we killed once, so I'll spend some of that. JERRY: Okay cool.

2276
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,440
JERRY: How much are you looking to spend?

2277
01:41:56,439 --> 01:41:58,479
KATE: I got six gold.

2278
01:41:58,699 --> 01:42:00,139
JERRY: Mm-hmm. KRIS: This is interesting.

2279
01:42:00,439 --> 01:42:04,519
KRIS: It's like a little-- Like I hear that little pan music. RYAN: If I had my other cards. I want to swap out--

2280
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:07,100
KRIS: The shop theme in my head. KATE: Yeah?

2281
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,280
AMY: Oh you don't have your whole deck with you?

2282
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:11,719
RYAN: No it's over at Elyssa's desk.

2283
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,800
JERRY: Mm-hmm. AMY: Oh no.

2284
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,060
KRIS: That is over-budget for us. I'm sorry, but we cannot-- KATE: (laughs)

2285
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:18,280
RYAN: I hope I need Command. AMY: Yeah. Oh...

2286
01:42:18,279 --> 01:42:22,899
JERRY: Yeah, the stuff that you're seeing at these shops here,

2287
01:42:22,899 --> 01:42:24,839
six gold isn't going to get you much.

2288
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:27,460
KATE: Okay. What about-- Hoardsman?

2289
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:30,180
JERRY: Yeah you can get healing herbs.

2290
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:31,680
KATE: Yeah. Okay. JERRY: Absolutely.

2291
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:40,159
JERRY: But in terms of a healing potion, something like that you'd need a few "sa-shays" of quasi... you know.

2292
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,000
KATE: And a healing herb is something you just go-- (eating sounds)

2293
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,619
We don't have to have an alchemist in the party to do--

2294
01:42:43,619 --> 01:42:47,099
JERRY: What it will do is it will help you with medicine checks.

2295
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:48,819
KRIS: Oh. KATE: Interesting.

2296
01:42:48,819 --> 01:42:49,899
RYAN: I'm rich and cool.

2297
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,520
KATE: Okay. Well buy us some potions, moneybags.

2298
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:57,040
KRIS: What's it going to cost per potion then? KATE: Fancy-boy.

2299
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:05,819
JERRY: You find a shop run by a person with exceedingly shifty eyes.

2300
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,539
A cart right on the edge of town...

2301
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:16,340
that will sell you three potions of healing...

2302
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,180
for 30 gold.

2303
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:23,159
RYAN: (sighs) KATE: I'm going to haggle.

2304
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,280
AMY: Yeah.

2305
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:26,900
KATE: I think we could probably-- Let's say...

2306
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,500
We're unloading these potions.

2307
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,439
You look like you got places to be.

2308
01:43:31,819 --> 01:43:34,259
Why don't we say all three for...

2309
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:35,500
15 gold?

2310
01:43:37,699 --> 01:43:38,699
JERRY: "25 gold."

2311
01:43:40,199 --> 01:43:45,559
He looks over your shoulder like he's expecting someone that he doesn't want to see.

2312
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,800
KATE. Right. Well let's-- You know. Let's um...

2313
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,000
KATE: Let's take our time. JERRY: "25 gold!"

2314
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,699
KATE: Let's take our time. 17 gold.

2315
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:51,739
JERRY: "25 gold!"

2316
01:43:51,739 --> 01:43:53,739
KATE: (sucks in breath) 18 gold.

2317
01:43:53,739 --> 01:43:54,579
JERRY: "20 gold!"

2318
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,880
KATE: 20 gold it is.

2319
01:43:56,539 --> 01:43:58,019
JERRY: He's reaching his hand out, just...

2320
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:59,360
(laughter) (clapping)

2321
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:02,479
KRIS: I love this dice-less interaction! It's amazing!

2322
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:03,939
RYAN: Should we test these potions?

2323
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,060
KATE: Not important. RYAN: Okay.

2324
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:07,620
KATE: Hand over the cash. AMY: It's sugar water.

2325
01:44:07,619 --> 01:44:09,199
KRIS: What do you got there? Got coin on you? KATE: 20 gold?

2326
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:10,920
RYAN: Yeah, I got it. AMY: Oh my god!

2327
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,920
RYAN: I'm royalty! JERRY: He's rich.

2328
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:18,380
AMY: I-- but here's the thing is that Walnut-- anytime he keeps saying he's a prince-- is just like...

2329
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:21,759
JERRY: All right. Now who is going to hold these potions?

2330
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,119
KATE/AMY: Hoardsman. JERRY: Individual?

2331
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:24,720
RYAN: Oh I was going to give one to everyone.

2332
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,760
JERRY: There's only three. KATE: Oh sure.

2333
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,680
RYAN: Yeah sorry. One to everyone else.

2334
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,280
KATE: Not you. You can heal yourself. RYAN: Because I have lay on hands.

2335
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:30,920
RYAN: I can heal myself, worst case scenario.

2336
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:31,899
JERRY: K. One, two, three.

2337
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:33,299
RYAN: I mean if we get split up, I'll just--

2338
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,239
(sounds of pleasure) I feel better already.

2339
01:44:35,239 --> 01:44:37,219
KRIS: Let's go ahead and just do that. RYAN: Oh it feels so good!

2340
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:39,240
KATE: Okay, okay. So now we each have a health potion. AMY: Health potion.

2341
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:42,919
JERRY: Yeah. A "health potion." &gt;&gt; KRIS: So well done. AMY: I'm going to make a little inventory right here.

2342
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:44,439
KRIS: I enjoy that.

2343
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:45,519
AMY: Jerry! RYAN: "Health potion" in quotes?

2344
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,320
AMY: Okay. KRIS: Yeah.

2345
01:44:47,739 --> 01:44:48,800
KATE: Or is it?

2346
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,840
RYAN: Can we test? Can anyone test it?

2347
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,440
KATE: I didn't bring my pH strips. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Can we smell it? JERRY: Is that a good idea? I don't know.

2348
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:55,139
JERRY: Put in them strips!

2349
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:56,660
No. It's like this...

2350
01:44:56,659 --> 01:44:58,619
RYAN: These are all health mimics.

2351
01:44:58,619 --> 01:45:00,479
KRIS: This potion has agreed to die. JERRY: So you are...

2352
01:45:01,819 --> 01:45:05,299
JERRY: You grab your potions. You were able to haggle down.

2353
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:08,180
You feel good about what you were able to deliver there.

2354
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:10,119
Grandma-style. You know what I mean?

2355
01:45:10,119 --> 01:45:12,779
We're talking about those...

2356
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,199
swap meet talents.

2357
01:45:16,659 --> 01:45:20,039
Over a hundred years of swap meet values.

2358
01:45:20,039 --> 01:45:23,019
KATE: Town champ swap meets. JERRY: You brought it home-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

2359
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:24,960
KATE: Had trophies. JERRY: GOTY. Right?

2360
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,279
KATE: They don't even give trophies for that, but they gave them to me.

2361
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:29,439
JERRY: No, exactly. And you had to haggle for it!

2362
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:31,419
JERRY: Like that's how it works! KATE: Had to haggle.

2363
01:45:32,119 --> 01:45:40,019
JERRY: And so as you load up, distribute them, he's just drumming his hands on the surface.

2364
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:46,440
You get in your cart. You start rolling out on the Stone Road.

2365
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,700
And then just when the town is at the edge of your vision,

2366
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:54,920
you look back and you see what you think is the town guard.

2367
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,359
You see a tall hat.

2368
01:45:57,319 --> 01:46:00,659
You see them just descend on the cart like locusts.

2369
01:46:00,659 --> 01:46:02,139
(laughter)

2370
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:02,980
KATE: Hmm.

2371
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:05,639
AMY: Did we just smuggle drugs out of town?

2372
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,240
AMY: Great. KATE: Mm-hmm.

2373
01:46:07,239 --> 01:46:08,679
JERRY: All right. AMY: Can't wait to drink this!

2374
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,940
JERRY: It's the sub-quest.

2375
01:46:09,939 --> 01:46:11,719
AMY: Yeah. KATE: Yeah. Be careful.

2376
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:12,960
RYAN: This has turned into GTA.

2377
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,800
KATE: Mental note.

2378
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,560
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. But you have three stars!

2379
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:19,880
AMY: When you said that we were going to another town, I got Skyrim quest anxiety.

2380
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,260
Where it's like, we're going to pick up more quests!

2381
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:22,520
And I can't deal with it.

2382
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:25,180
JERRY: Yeah exactly. No, it's okay. I'll handle it.

2383
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:27,280
I mean right now, how many quests do you really have?

2384
01:46:27,319 --> 01:46:28,460
AMY: Five.

2385
01:46:28,539 --> 01:46:30,140
JERRY: You got butts...

2386
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,579
KRIS: You got butt one. KATE: Butts. &gt;&gt; RYAN: The butt quest.

2387
01:46:31,579 --> 01:46:34,920
AMY: Butt quest. Cart quest. KRIS: That's stuff later though.

2388
01:46:35,239 --> 01:46:37,059
AMY: Onyx quest.

2389
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:38,560
JERRY: Oh! You're thinking about the chicken.

2390
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:42,079
AMY: I'm the Documancer! RYAN: Yeah, so the chicken quest--

2391
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:45,140
RYAN: and then the to-be-determined party security quest.

2392
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,220
RYAN: What's the 5th one? JERRY: Exactly. Oh yeah that's true.

2393
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:49,619
AMY: A dark quest. No one needs to know about.

2394
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:50,739
(whispering) I miscounted!

2395
01:46:50,739 --> 01:46:51,760
A dark quest!

2396
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:55,640
JERRY: But that's what I like. So you've internalized this Documancer business.

2397
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,619
Like all the way in there.

2398
01:46:57,619 --> 01:46:59,439
AMY: I have a Google spreadsheet of our quests.

2399
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:00,439
AMY: For real. JERRY: Exactly.

2400
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:01,399
AMY: But a magic one!

2401
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:05,619
JERRY: So as you progress east along this road...

2402
01:47:05,899 --> 01:47:09,839
there aren't quite as many carts as you saw going north and south on the Long Road.

2403
01:47:10,619 --> 01:47:17,500
This is a place people go to seasonally.

2404
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:21,180
It isn't quite as busy as that north-south passage.

2405
01:47:22,539 --> 01:47:27,060
You know that in the great distance the Stone Bridge...

2406
01:47:27,739 --> 01:47:35,479
A beautiful-- Basically a cathedral of stonework that has been the site of famous battles.

2407
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:40,520
That's a substantial period of time away from here.

2408
01:47:40,779 --> 01:47:47,000
But it's basically like cathedral-level geometric beauty that people just ride carts over.

2409
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,199
Like it's a note-worthy piece.

2410
01:47:52,159 --> 01:48:02,639
Not far. Maybe four and half, five hours into your trip going east on the Stone Road.

2411
01:48:03,239 --> 01:48:11,300
You come across what you hope won't be the first ruined cart.

2412
01:48:12,699 --> 01:48:13,720
So...

2413
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:21,160
It is off the road. Perhaps... 50, 60 feet?

2414
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,440
Just sort of dragged off.

2415
01:48:24,439 --> 01:48:27,159
The horses are apparently completely decoupled from it.

2416
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:34,340
But you-- As I say, this could be the first evidence of this.

2417
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:36,119
There could be other information.

2418
01:48:36,119 --> 01:48:39,159
Ryan may have another interpretation of these events.

2419
01:48:39,159 --> 01:48:40,760
RYAN: (laughs) JERRY: You know?

2420
01:48:41,859 --> 01:48:43,159
RYAN: Well we should check it out.

2421
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:44,979
KRIS: No, that's no-- KATE: Yeah? You want to hop out?

2422
01:48:44,979 --> 01:48:46,439
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: All right. I'll stop the cart.

2423
01:48:46,439 --> 01:48:47,779
KRIS: Okay. KATE: You want to get out there?

2424
01:48:48,039 --> 01:48:49,500
KATE: I'll keep an eye on this cart.

2425
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,560
RYAN: All right.

2426
01:48:50,979 --> 01:48:52,399
Yeah I mean, could be a trap. Yeah.

2427
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:53,719
KATE: Go on, Donaar.

2428
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:55,340
KATE: What do you see? What do your... KRIS: Who's going to stop for a ruined--

2429
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:56,980
JERRY: Yeah. What do your dragonborn eyes see? KATE: What do your dragon eyes see?

2430
01:48:56,979 --> 01:48:57,779
RYAN: Yeah.

2431
01:48:57,979 --> 01:48:59,239
KRIS: What you looking at?

2432
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,780
RYAN: I don't know. Should I roll? What do I see?

2433
01:49:01,779 --> 01:49:04,559
JERRY: So you jump out of the back? RYAN: Hmm.

2434
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,539
JERRY: And then your feed hit the ground.

2435
01:49:07,539 --> 01:49:11,779
And then you hear two more feet hit the ground right behind you.

2436
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:15,319
Waelvur is apparently interested in this as well.

2437
01:49:15,319 --> 01:49:16,439
RYAN: Oh. AMY: Oh for spare parts.

2438
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:18,839
RYAN: Yeah, I want to loot the cart. KATE: Cart enthusiast!

2439
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,880
JERRY: Yeah. So he has brought his bottle with him.

2440
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:26,659
You don't know to what extent that is going to affect his assessment of these proceedings.

2441
01:49:26,659 --> 01:49:32,099
But your experience, Rosie, is that he knows how to drink.

2442
01:49:32,319 --> 01:49:34,639
KATE: He does. JERRY: He's gone pro-tier.

2443
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:37,680
AMY: Among other things. KATE: His expertise goes up after he's drinking.

2444
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:42,059
JERRY: This is what you see pulled over.

2445
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:47,039
As I said, the bridle-- the entire front of it is a wreck.

2446
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,939
As though it's been-- the horses had been cut free.

2447
01:49:50,039 --> 01:49:57,340
And then the tines that project from the front of the cart are actually dug into the ground in front of it.

2448
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:00,020
As though it moved for a time and then was stopped.

2449
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:07,600
You see here what looks to be a carriage that held prisoners.

2450
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,760
AMY: K. RYAN: Ooh.

2451
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:16,380
JERRY: So the carriage body is of very sturdy construction.

2452
01:50:16,779 --> 01:50:18,939
It's not comfortable in any way.

2453
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,560
It is meant to carry criminals from place to place.

2454
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:28,760
But it is very practical and pragmatic in its manufacture.

2455
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:35,300
Up where you would tie the reins off, you see an owl.

2456
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:45,279
A small carving of an owl that has a strip of leather wrapped around one of its metal feet.

2457
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:54,579
There is also, as you open up the back, you can see that it has part of--

2458
01:50:54,859 --> 01:50:59,859
basically the armature and some of the mechanism of a small catapult.

2459
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:04,640
And this one also has...

2460
01:51:08,579 --> 01:51:13,399
What you would-- for a lack of a better term, a cool spoiler.

2461
01:51:14,779 --> 01:51:15,579
RYAN: Nice.

2462
01:51:15,579 --> 01:51:16,559
KATE: Cool? JERRY: Yeah.

2463
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:22,480
RYAN: It's a cool spoiler. JERRY: It has a sweeping darkwood edge on the back.

2464
01:51:22,699 --> 01:51:24,399
KATE: We're definitely going to want that.

2465
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,280
JERRY: So these are the parts from here.

2466
01:51:27,819 --> 01:51:30,079
Waelvur's pretty deep into this bottle.

2467
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:34,279
You wonder if he has more in there or if this is another bottle.

2468
01:51:35,739 --> 01:51:37,920
But that's the situation.

2469
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:43,460
He's creeping around this cart carcass with some interest.

2470
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:44,340
RYAN: Hmm.

2471
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:47,519
KRIS: Guy knows his carts. AMY: Grab that owl.

2472
01:51:48,039 --> 01:51:50,579
RYAN: I snatch that bottle from him. I say,

2473
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:53,400
Focus on what's at hand here, buddy!

2474
01:51:54,119 --> 01:51:55,059
Had enough out of you.

2475
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:58,800
JERRY: He reaches into a back pocket and gets a flask.

2476
01:51:59,739 --> 01:52:00,840
RYAN: All right.

2477
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:04,020
(laughter)

2478
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:06,080
I put the bottle in my pack.

2479
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:07,479
KATE: Add it to your inventory kit.

2480
01:52:07,479 --> 01:52:09,259
RYAN: Hmm. Waelvur's bottle.

2481
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:16,079
JERRY: So as I said. It's a sturdy, if boxy, prisoner carriage.

2482
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:17,860
Cool darkwood spoiler.

2483
01:52:18,979 --> 01:52:20,979
Part of a catapult mechanism?

2484
01:52:20,979 --> 01:52:24,599
And an owl statue to tie off--

2485
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,380
RYAN: So we just did a little pass-around.

2486
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:27,640
JERRY: Exactly. RYAN: Like I'm...

2487
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:29,440
KATE: Are you out there too?

2488
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:31,679
KRIS: Yeah. I'm going out. RYAN: hollering to make sure, is anyone in there?

2489
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,600
RYAN: Is this... is anyone around?

2490
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:37,579
KRIS: Yeah is the compartment shattered open?

2491
01:52:37,579 --> 01:52:39,680
Or is it like solid and shut?

2492
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:47,340
JERRY: It's odd. So the actual door on the back that would be released by the person who is bringing the prisoners--

2493
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,720
The lock on it is broken.

2494
01:52:50,979 --> 01:52:57,500
And you see near or around the lock, you see bite marks.

2495
01:52:58,460 --> 01:52:59,300
KRIS: Hmm.

2496
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:02,800
AMY: My favorite kind of marks for a thing we're tracking.

2497
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:04,539
KATE: Are you out there too?

2498
01:53:04,539 --> 01:53:05,760
AMY: I would like to jump down.

2499
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,619
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. It's all there for you.

2500
01:53:09,399 --> 01:53:10,619
So those are our things.

2501
01:53:10,619 --> 01:53:14,739
And he's looking back at your cart and he's looking at this cart...

2502
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:17,899
AMY: Can I do a survival check real quick on these bite marks?

2503
01:53:17,899 --> 01:53:18,920
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

2504
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,840
AMY: I just want to see if I know anything about them.

2505
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:23,440
I want to see if I know anything about bite marks.

2506
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:27,300
Ooh. Maybe I do. 12 plus five. 17?

2507
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:28,739
JERRY: They're not animal marks.

2508
01:53:28,739 --> 01:53:30,199
KRIS: Ugh. RYAN: Hmm.

2509
01:53:30,199 --> 01:53:32,800
AMY: Ew. Gross. Ugh.

2510
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,900
KATE: Walnut's not interested anymore!

2511
01:53:34,899 --> 01:53:36,500
(laughter) JERRY: Now it's gross!

2512
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,380
(laughter)

2513
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:39,440
AMY: She immediately goes like, people bit this.

2514
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:41,500
KATE: (laughs)

2515
01:53:41,539 --> 01:53:44,680
RYAN: So I yell and no one's in there, and no one's around, right?

2516
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:46,560
JERRY: No, no, no. Whatever-- RYAN: I say, hey. Okay.

2517
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,140
RYAN: Whatever's in proximity.

2518
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:50,400
JERRY: Whatever happened here, happened already. RYAN: Okay.

2519
01:53:51,819 --> 01:53:54,159
RYAN: Then I grab drunkee and I say,

2520
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:56,119
What do you think? Should we--

2521
01:53:56,619 --> 01:53:58,680
Anything you can take to salvage our cart?

2522
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:01,400
Or should we switch carts? What's your professional opinion?

2523
01:54:01,399 --> 01:54:03,579
JERRY: He takes a deep swig.

2524
01:54:03,579 --> 01:54:05,420
RYAN: I'm going to take that fucking bottle, dude.

2525
01:54:05,699 --> 01:54:08,679
JERRY: Then he takes a second, even deeper swig.

2526
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,399
KRIS: Looking at you in the eye. RYAN: I know.

2527
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:14,460
JERRY: Then he holds it up and looks at it.

2528
01:54:14,579 --> 01:54:17,420
And then shakes it a little bit and gets some in his eye.

2529
01:54:18,119 --> 01:54:19,359
And then he's like-- (grunting)

2530
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:21,299
RYAN: I say, give me the bottle! And I take this one too.

2531
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:22,819
KATE: I'm going to yell from the cart,

2532
01:54:22,819 --> 01:54:24,399
Don't knock it till you try it!

2533
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:27,220
JERRY: Try what, Rosie?

2534
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:30,159
JERRY: So-- RYAN: Throw this one off in the distance.

2535
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:31,920
RYAN: I don't keep this one.

2536
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,220
JERRY: He's like, "Well what do you want?"

2537
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:34,460
KRIS: He's doing good by us.

2538
01:54:34,779 --> 01:54:36,579
RYAN: Cart analysis! Here.

2539
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:39,960
JERRY: "I can take that and put it over there."

2540
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:42,140
"Take that. I can remove this."

2541
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:43,460
"What do you want?"

2542
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,880
KATE: Let's Mad Max our cart. RYAN: I want to combine these carts!

2543
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:47,920
KATE: Yes. RYAN: You drunk little fool.

2544
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:49,680
(laughter)

2545
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:50,440
KATE: So angry.

2546
01:54:50,439 --> 01:54:53,139
RYAN: I know! I got no patience for this guy.

2547
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:53,960
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

2548
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:57,240
So he looks to you and he says,

2549
01:54:57,239 --> 01:54:59,039
"Can you bring that cart..."

2550
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:02,760
"over here?"

2551
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,760
KATE: (laughs) RYAN: Oh my god.

2552
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:06,659
(laughter)

2553
01:55:06,899 --> 01:55:10,339
AMY: I see the rage building in Donaar, and I'm just like, okay.

2554
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:11,360
JERRY: Now he's going to cover him in acid.

2555
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:16,380
AMY: And I want to just like lead Coriander and try and like get the cart--

2556
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:18,220
KRIS: Get the carts together? AMY: Get the carts closer.

2557
01:55:18,859 --> 01:55:22,819
RYAN: We got new horses. Coriander's probably going to be dinner.

2558
01:55:22,819 --> 01:55:24,199
KATE: I'm going to-- RYAN: Cori-dinner.

2559
01:55:24,199 --> 01:55:27,559
KATE: I'm going to hop of this cart because it seems like no one has actually tried to open these doors yet.

2560
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:33,340
I'm going to stick my quarterstaff in the bars of the prison cart and just kind of nudge around in there.

2561
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:34,980
KATE: See if there's anything soft.

2562
01:55:34,979 --> 01:55:37,639
JERRY: No, there's nothing soft or moist.

2563
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:39,220
KATE: K. JERRY: Or flaky.

2564
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:40,199
KATE: Okay. RYAN: All right.

2565
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:41,280
KRIS: Or buttery.

2566
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:44,079
JERRY: (laughing) Yeah you can open the back of this cart. (laughter)

2567
01:55:44,079 --> 01:55:46,059
You can open the back of the cart if you want to.

2568
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:50,580
This has been passed over pretty substantially in here.

2569
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,700
There's a couple old swords?

2570
01:55:55,699 --> 01:55:56,840
Longswords.

2571
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:00,980
But there are not any-- There's no coin.

2572
01:56:01,779 --> 01:56:08,779
You can see something that might have been a secret compartment underneath one of the benches.

2573
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:12,100
Where you can see the chain link.

2574
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:14,660
But it's empty. It's been gone through.

2575
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:16,180
KATE: Okay.

2576
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:18,380
AMY: Can we salvage one of these-- Yeah.

2577
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,579
AMY: Yeah get this guy to salvage these parts. RYAN: Yeah.

2578
01:56:20,579 --> 01:56:21,640
JERRY: Go ahead and drive the process.

2579
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:22,760
RYAN: I want to take that...

2580
01:56:23,319 --> 01:56:24,840
KATE: Cool spoiler. Yeah. RYAN: that cool-ass spoiler.

2581
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,340
KRIS: It's coming. RYAN: And I want that owl.

2582
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:28,319
JERRY: Cool spoiler. RYAN: I want them swords.

2583
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:32,519
JERRY: Hey now, I was going to say, this owl is...

2584
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,640
KRIS: I was going to say, let's look at this owl.

2585
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:36,180
AMY: Yeah it said it had leather around its...

2586
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,520
KATE: Its foot? AMY: Its foot.

2587
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:38,659
KRIS: Hmm. KATE: The foot.

2588
01:56:38,659 --> 01:56:42,039
AMY: Is there a secret missive in there? KATE: Yeah should we do some checks on this?

2589
01:56:42,039 --> 01:56:43,800
KATE: See if it has some significance? JERRY: Absolutely.

2590
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,119
AMY: Everybody, look at this owl!

2591
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:46,140
(laughter) KATE: Druids!

2592
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:47,820
JERRY: No. Dude. Dude. KATE: Concentrate!

2593
01:56:47,819 --> 01:56:49,819
KATE: I'll do a history check...

2594
01:56:50,119 --> 01:56:51,460
Which is a ten.

2595
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:55,300
KRIS: Can I investigate this owl? JERRY: Arcana-- Absolutely. Arcana is good.

2596
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:57,039
KRIS: Oh arcana. Imma do it. Okay.

2597
01:56:57,039 --> 01:56:59,460
KRIS: I'm actually-- RYAN: What about athletics?

2598
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,819
KATE: Rosie does a history check, and she's like,

2599
01:57:01,819 --> 01:57:03,819
I've never read a book about any owls.

2600
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:06,319
JERRY: Period. KATE: I've never read a book with an owl in it.

2601
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:07,819
JERRY: Not because I haven't been able to. Because I don't like them.

2602
01:57:07,819 --> 01:57:09,399
KATE: I don't like them. RYAN: I got 18 on history.

2603
01:57:09,399 --> 01:57:10,739
KRIS: Hmm. KATE: Wow.

2604
01:57:10,939 --> 01:57:12,859
RYAN: I know a lot about owls.

2605
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:14,679
KATE: Tell me one thing about owls.

2606
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:17,220
RYAN: They go hoot.

2607
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,100
KRIS: Bet you didn't know.

2608
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:21,020
RYAN: Yeah bet you didn't know. The more you know. KRIS: 13 arcana.

2609
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:25,500
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. They're symbols of wisdom and protection.

2610
01:57:26,539 --> 01:57:29,100
They're commonly adorned on carts.

2611
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,079
You...

2612
01:57:30,699 --> 01:57:33,179
It would take more investigation on your part.

2613
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:36,039
You'd have to come back and approach this later.

2614
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:41,359
But it's not just a statue of an owl.

2615
01:57:42,579 --> 01:57:43,640
KRIS: Oh yuck.

2616
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,460
KRIS: We going to-- RYAN: It's like your owl's owl.

2617
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:47,359
KRIS: No. We're going to keep this owl with us.

2618
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:49,479
JERRY: Yeah. Bring it with.

2619
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:51,340
Continue to spend quality time with it.

2620
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:52,279
KATE: You're like, that's my owl. JERRY: So yeah.

2621
01:57:52,279 --> 01:57:54,039
JERRY: So what are you trying to get off of this thing?

2622
01:57:55,479 --> 01:57:56,619
AMY: Spoiler. JERRY: Cool spoiler!

2623
01:57:56,619 --> 01:57:58,699
RYAN: The spoiler, the owl, the swords...

2624
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,900
AMY: Really? Is there like a spare wheel in here? KRIS: See something good? &gt;&gt; RYAN: Sell them!

2625
01:58:02,899 --> 01:58:04,239
KATE: And their toothbrush.

2626
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:08,360
RYAN: Look if this was Skyrim, I'm "take all."

2627
01:58:08,359 --> 01:58:09,839
KRIS: How long are all these modifications going to take?

2628
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,260
KATE: Mugs. Cheese. What do we got? KRIS: How well we in for?

2629
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:15,539
KRIS: How long are we on the road while he cobbles together a super-cart?

2630
01:58:15,539 --> 01:58:17,319
JERRY: We'll see. We'll see. There's--

2631
01:58:17,319 --> 01:58:18,519
AMY: We're getting a good cart out of this!

2632
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:21,020
RYAN: Like there's lumber. I feel like we can reinforce, right?

2633
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:23,600
KATE: Yeah and there's also parts of a small catapult. RYAN: He obviously knows his stuff.

2634
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,480
KATE: Which I feel might be useful for us if that displacer beast comes back.

2635
01:58:27,479 --> 01:58:30,239
RYAN: Take the catapult, and just reinforce... JERRY: So...

2636
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,380
JERRY: And there's also the carriage itself on the back.

2637
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,920
I mean you could choose to just go that way.

2638
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,100
RYAN: Take that cart? KATE: Yeah.

2639
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:41,280
JERRY: And modify the rest. AMY: It looks way more sturdy.

2640
01:58:41,439 --> 01:58:44,119
KATE: And it was a prison cart so I feel like we can keep stuff out.

2641
01:58:44,279 --> 01:58:46,899
AMY: Yeah is there anything from our cart that we would want?

2642
01:58:46,899 --> 01:58:47,960
JERRY: Yeah. That's the question, right?

2643
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:49,619
RYAN: So we're just stealing someone's cart now?

2644
01:58:49,619 --> 01:58:51,340
KRIS: It's an old cart. It's a busted cart. AMY: We're not stealing it!

2645
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:53,239
RYAN: Why are we doing this mission?

2646
01:58:53,239 --> 01:58:55,619
All right. We got our reward. The end. We go back?

2647
01:58:55,619 --> 01:58:57,500
KRIS: No, we have to get that ass!

2648
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:00,020
AMY: We want the ass and we want the 200 gold.

2649
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:01,940
RYAN: Oh we do want the ass statue. Shit.

2650
01:59:01,939 --> 01:59:03,460
JERRY: The cart is not the payment. RYAN: Goddamn it.

2651
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:05,699
AMY: Also the other thing is-- RYAN: Sprinkle that MacGuffin in there.

2652
01:59:06,199 --> 01:59:09,539
AMY: The other thing is I point to the missive that has the, you know.

2653
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:14,260
And I'm like, I want to report to Head Office that we did something this week.

2654
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,420
JERRY: (laughs)

2655
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:17,640
AMY: I want a good Q1! KRIS: This cart was just something for us to the job with.

2656
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:19,100
JERRY: Q-motherfucking-1.

2657
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:20,140
KATE: Consider this...

2658
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:21,720
We take both carts.

2659
01:59:21,939 --> 01:59:22,899
Two carts...

2660
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:24,680
AMY: But how do we pull it? RYAN: Split the party.

2661
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:26,240
KATE: Donaar pulls the second one.

2662
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:27,199
JERRY: Split the "carty." AMY: He'll never do that.

2663
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:28,279
RYAN: No, I thought there were horses there.

2664
01:59:28,279 --> 01:59:29,519
AMY: No, no the horses-- KATE: The horses are gone.

2665
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,100
RYAN: Oh they were gone. Uncoupled. KATE: You're going to have to pull the cart.

2666
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:34,500
RYAN: That ain't happening. You know what else can probably pull a cart? A bear.

2667
01:59:34,659 --> 01:59:36,800
AMY: (laughing) That's true. KATE: That's even better. (laughs)

2668
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,520
RYAN: That's true, I don't see a bear.

2669
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:39,700
Guess we only get one cart.

2670
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:41,239
RYAN: Wac-wac. KRIS: Shoot.

2671
01:59:41,239 --> 01:59:42,559
AMY: We don't need the crummy one.

2672
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,580
AMY: All right we can take the-- KATE: Let's transfer.

2673
01:59:44,579 --> 01:59:48,640
AMY: We can take the all-weather canvas.

2674
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,700
The leather.

2675
01:59:49,699 --> 01:59:51,880
KATE: The S-hooks. AMY: The S-hooks.

2676
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:53,260
JERRY: Love it. KRIS: All that junk in the back.

2677
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:54,539
AMY: All the nail. JERRY: Junk in the trunk!

2678
01:59:54,539 --> 01:59:56,319
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Whatever Waelvur needs.

2679
01:59:56,319 --> 01:59:58,319
AMY: And then let's-- Can we like...

2680
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:03,039
Can somebody strong peel just a couple of loose boards out of there?

2681
02:00:03,039 --> 02:00:06,119
Just so we have like a cart repair kit.

2682
02:00:06,119 --> 02:00:07,439
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: Like a first aid kit.

2683
02:00:07,439 --> 02:00:10,259
AMY: You know, you keep it in the trunk in case... KATE: Muscles. You want to peel some boards off?

2684
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:11,820
RYAN: You know what's strong? A bear.

2685
02:00:11,819 --> 02:00:13,099
(laughter)

2686
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:15,320
JERRY: Waelvur is picking up what you're putting down.

2687
02:00:15,319 --> 02:00:17,639
He is over at the cart.

2688
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:21,420
And you see him-- he removes a couple key...

2689
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:24,460
JERRY: A couple key posts. KRIS: (laughs)

2690
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:27,059
JERRY: And then jumps back. AMY: (laughs)

2691
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:32,199
JERRY: As it basically devolves into a wagon kit.

2692
02:00:32,199 --> 02:00:33,659
KRIS: Yeah. AMY: Amazing.

2693
02:00:33,779 --> 02:00:37,759
JERRY: So he's able to grab a few planks...

2694
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:39,020
AMY: And the wheels.

2695
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:41,100
JERRY: to bring along. You don't want those wheels.

2696
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:42,120
AMY: Not even one wheel?

2697
02:00:42,119 --> 02:00:46,180
JERRY: Maybe the one wheel he stole from Westbridge. AMY: I want one wheel.

2698
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:47,739
JERRY: That might be a good plan. KRIS: I want to wear it.

2699
02:00:47,739 --> 02:00:48,619
AMY: I want one wheel.

2700
02:00:48,619 --> 02:00:51,239
KATE: Like a necklace. AMY: Actually, I like this idea...

2701
02:00:51,239 --> 02:00:53,559
AMY: Because if we get the people who are responsible for raiding

2702
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,380
and we don't want to murder them we can bring them back in the thing.

2703
02:00:56,380 --> 02:01:00,039
KRIS: Or their bodies. KATE: An anti-murder campaign from Walnut. How surprising!

2704
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:01,659
KRIS: You can go in there with them.

2705
02:01:01,659 --> 02:01:03,319
AMY: You guys get on me for murdering stuff!

2706
02:01:03,319 --> 02:01:05,259
You get on me for not murdering stuff!

2707
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:08,320
KRIS: We did a great job with the displacer beast. AMY: You're the kid sister of the group.

2708
02:01:08,319 --> 02:01:09,500
KATE: We got to tease you.

2709
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:10,600
AMY: Sure.

2710
02:01:10,939 --> 02:01:15,000
KRIS: Okay. We got what we need.

2711
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,300
RYAN: Make me a comfy bed in there.

2712
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:20,420
JERRY: So you're going to roll out. So you're going to keep a hold on the catapult...

2713
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:21,680
KATE: Yeah. Right. JERRY: armature?

2714
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:22,480
JERRY: They're in the back?

2715
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:24,139
KATE: Is it usable?

2716
02:01:25,699 --> 02:01:26,699
JERRY: You could ask.

2717
02:01:26,699 --> 02:01:29,519
KATE: I'm going to-- Yeah. I'll ask Waelvur.

2718
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:34,480
Does this look functional to you? Do we need to repair it in order to make this a catapult situation again?

2719
02:01:34,479 --> 02:01:36,419
JERRY: I'll have him take a look at it.

2720
02:01:40,199 --> 02:01:42,840
K'thriss, he's staring at it for a long time.

2721
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:47,300
You're not sure he's going to stop staring at it.

2722
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:49,460
AMY: Oh no.

2723
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:52,960
KRIS: (stammering) Okay can I rouse him?

2724
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:54,760
Can I just shake him on the shoulder?

2725
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:57,380
KRIS: Friend? The catapult? RYAN: Did he say, arouse him?

2726
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,900
KRIS: I arouse him. Yeah.

2727
02:01:58,899 --> 02:02:00,559
RYAN: Twist his nipples. KRIS: If this doesn't work...

2728
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,280
RYAN: Say, hey! Focus, buddy!

2729
02:02:02,279 --> 02:02:03,819
KRIS: If this don't work, he's lost.

2730
02:02:03,819 --> 02:02:05,759
JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: I leave him here by the side of the road.

2731
02:02:09,479 --> 02:02:11,379
KRIS: Jeez. Can I perceive him?

2732
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:14,359
JERRY: You don't have to perceive him! KATE: Something about that catapult.

2733
02:02:14,359 --> 02:02:16,779
JERRY: No, yeah, yeah. yeah. He's just like,

2734
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,100
"I just really like it."

2735
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:21,079
KRIS: (laughs)

2736
02:02:21,079 --> 02:02:22,539
It could be ours.

2737
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:27,240
KATE: My dude. You got to focus up. (laughs)

2738
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:32,579
KRIS: It's a good cart. JERRY: You see him go out and examine the side.

2739
02:02:33,699 --> 02:02:40,139
JERRY: And you can sort of see some diagram just unfolding in his mind.

2740
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:42,980
You see his eyes just flitting from place to place.

2741
02:02:42,979 --> 02:02:44,159
And he says,

2742
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,640
"I would need some time."

2743
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:49,980
KATE: How much time? JERRY: "But I can roll with that?"

2744
02:02:54,079 --> 02:02:56,680
JERRY: "If we got a big fire, I could probably do it overnight."

2745
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:00,220
KRIS: Siege horse!

2746
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:01,760
KATE: I think it's worth it.

2747
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,920
I think having an extra ballistic--

2748
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,239
AMY: What time of day is it?

2749
02:03:05,239 --> 02:03:06,659
KRIS: It's afternoon, I think.

2750
02:03:06,659 --> 02:03:08,840
RYAN: Can I sleep in the cart as he works on the cart?

2751
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:09,960
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: Yes!

2752
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:11,279
RYAN: Okay, then yeah. Let's do that.

2753
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:12,500
Yeah. JERRY: It'd be loud.

2754
02:03:12,619 --> 02:03:16,300
KATE: Can we build a big fire? You got a big fire in you?

2755
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:19,020
KRIS: We got a wagon we can set on fire. We can have a huge fire.

2756
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:19,900
KATE: That's true.

2757
02:03:19,899 --> 02:03:24,399
JERRY: It is not time to shut down just yet.

2758
02:03:24,399 --> 02:03:26,179
AMY: So why don't we keep going and then we'll-- JERRY: Yep, yep.

2759
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:27,020
KATE: Okay.

2760
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:29,660
AMY: When it's time we can work on it. KATE: Got it, okay. Yes. Great.

2761
02:03:30,039 --> 02:03:31,159
JERRY: Exactly.

2762
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:33,159
So you roll back in.

2763
02:03:33,159 --> 02:03:39,159
You can see Waelvur is inside just...

2764
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:45,199
running his hand along the edge of this catapult armature.

2765
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:47,980
Very, very excited about the possibilities.

2766
02:03:47,979 --> 02:03:49,379
AMY: He's just very a sensual man.

2767
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,819
JERRY: He is! KRIS: Yeah, I look at Rosie and say,

2768
02:03:51,819 --> 02:03:53,239
KRIS: (whispering) Is that what it was like?

2769
02:03:53,239 --> 02:03:55,819
(laughter)

2770
02:03:55,819 --> 02:03:56,840
Just curious.

2771
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:59,199
JERRY: Yeah you hear-- AMY: He's just into intimacy in general.

2772
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:00,619
JERRY: You hear...

2773
02:04:00,619 --> 02:04:03,319
Waelvur doesn't look back at you,

2774
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:06,280
but he looks down at the catapult and he says,

2775
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,159
"She's a weapon."

2776
02:04:08,420 --> 02:04:10,340
(laughter) AMY: Whoa.

2777
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:13,079
RYAN: And I say, it was nothing like that!

2778
02:04:13,079 --> 02:04:14,220
(laughter)

2779
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:15,920
JERRY/AMY: I was there! RYAN: I was there.

2780
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,060
RYAN: I lived it. I will never stop living it.

2781
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:18,860
(laughter)

2782
02:04:18,859 --> 02:04:20,679
JERRY: I can see it now!

2783
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:23,840
So you continue.

2784
02:04:25,819 --> 02:04:29,819
Starting to become similar to the Sumber Hills that you drove through before.

2785
02:04:29,819 --> 02:04:37,279
You're starting to reach an area where hills like that are rising up on both sides, before the Stone Bridge.

2786
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:41,220
And this is where you find the second cart.

2787
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:42,600
KRIS: Hmm. AMY: Huzzah.

2788
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:44,139
AMY: What's it look like?

2789
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:49,000
JERRY: This other cart has...

2790
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:53,239
It's maybe received a little bit more of a rougher ride.

2791
02:04:53,239 --> 02:04:58,300
But you think it just might be because the prisoner carriage is so well manufactured.

2792
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:04,439
This is almost like Gothic in its look.

2793
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:08,079
It almost looks like a cart from a story.

2794
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:09,739
AMY: Shit! Took the wrong cart.

2795
02:05:09,739 --> 02:05:12,119
JERRY: It has a-- RYAN: Is this the rest of the game now?

2796
02:05:12,119 --> 02:05:14,720
KRIS: We each get a cart! RYAN: We just jump from cart to cart?

2797
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:19,840
JERRY: It has a spacious interior.

2798
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:20,880
RYAN: Ooh.

2799
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:27,180
JERRY: On one side is sort of a U-shape of velvet couches.

2800
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:28,740
RYAN: Oh... AMY: (laughing) We got to take this cart.

2801
02:05:28,739 --> 02:05:30,739
RYAN: I want this cart. KRIS: It's sumptuously appointed.

2802
02:05:31,239 --> 02:05:41,079
JERRY: In the back it's almost like the way a boat or a ship has to be clever about a constrained space.

2803
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:43,600
There's different sorts of tables.

2804
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:47,840
Small workspaces that can fold out from the inside there in the back.

2805
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:52,960
Where you would tie the reins around on this,

2806
02:05:53,659 --> 02:05:56,260
is a small statuette of a cat.

2807
02:06:00,380 --> 02:06:02,800
There's also an array--

2808
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:09,560
Sort of tied together by straps of black leather, tightly,

2809
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:12,800
is what looks to be a bunch of cigar boxes.

2810
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,500
But the closer you look...

2811
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:21,520
you peer inside the box you can see that it's just rows of wands.

2812
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:23,579
KATE: Oh... RYAN: Mmm.

2813
02:06:23,979 --> 02:06:25,459
JERRY: So it's almost like-- RYAN: Take that.

2814
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:32,880
JERRY: It's almost like a two by four set of cigar box-like wand cases.

2815
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:34,760
KRIS: And where was this found?

2816
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:38,920
JERRY: This is in this sort of Gothic... KRIS: Oh inside.

2817
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:41,960
JERRY: blackwood, red velvet interior.

2818
02:06:44,899 --> 02:06:53,079
There is also underneath this cart--

2819
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:59,480
It's sort of tipped on its side, like one wheel is kind of up on a ridge of stone.

2820
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:03,259
If it were darker it would be easier to see.

2821
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:08,640
But examining the undercarriage, you can see a glass chamber.

2822
02:07:08,979 --> 02:07:11,719
And you can recognize it. It's filled with Dancing Lights.

2823
02:07:11,939 --> 02:07:12,979
KRIS: Oh. Okay.

2824
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:14,760
Light source?

2825
02:07:15,039 --> 02:07:17,439
KRIS: It's still active? KATE: So it actually has ground effects?

2826
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:18,399
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: Nice.

2827
02:07:18,399 --> 02:07:19,379
RYAN: Hmm.

2828
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:25,300
AMY: I mean I know that, meta, you're annoyed that we just keep switching carts; but I feel like...

2829
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:29,400
KATE: I think that Donaar might prefer this cart. RYAN: No, I like this. It's real velour!

2830
02:07:29,399 --> 02:07:32,000
JERRY: Yeah. No, it is nice!

2831
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,760
You run your soft palm against it.

2832
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:36,920
KRIS: I don't like it.

2833
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:40,640
AMY: You don't like a goth cart? KRIS: It rubs me the wrong way.

2834
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:43,600
KRIS: Oh I like the look of it. I don't care for that velvet. I'd rip that out.

2835
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:45,620
RYAN: No. The velvet stays.

2836
02:07:45,619 --> 02:07:47,140
We add more velvet.

2837
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:50,200
JERRY: (laughs) Actually we put velvet outside. RYAN: Yeah.

2838
02:07:50,199 --> 02:07:51,399
KRIS: That's where I want it.

2839
02:07:51,699 --> 02:07:52,539
Waelvur.

2840
02:07:52,539 --> 02:07:53,579
(laughter)

2841
02:07:53,579 --> 02:07:54,859
KRIS: Upholster this cart. JERRY: Snap, snap!

2842
02:07:54,859 --> 02:07:55,979
(laughter)

2843
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:59,760
KATE: Would we recognize any logos on those wand boxes?

2844
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:02,159
Is there a manufacturer?

2845
02:08:02,159 --> 02:08:03,519
AMY: Yeah what brand are these?

2846
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:04,380
RYAN/KATE: Yeah.

2847
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:06,420
AMY: I don't want these fly-by-night knockoffs. RYAN: Generic?

2848
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:08,119
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. KATE: Yeah.

2849
02:08:08,119 --> 02:08:10,239
RYAN: Costco-assed wands. Get out of here. KRIS: Yeah. Bulk.

2850
02:08:10,239 --> 02:08:12,179
KATE: Costco's got really high-quality goods.

2851
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:13,119
RYAN: Gucci wands.

2852
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:16,300
KRIS: I want to do-- AMY: This episode brought to you by Costco.

2853
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:26,640
JERRY: In an attractive, swooping script, it says, "Percival's."

2854
02:08:26,979 --> 02:08:30,299
KRIS: Ah... RYAN: Hey, like my toothbrush.

2855
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:32,740
KRIS: Hey! AMY: The very same.

2856
02:08:32,739 --> 02:08:34,219
AMY: You look at all these-- KRIS: (growls)

2857
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:35,980
AMY: Your toothbrush was a wand? KATE: Toothbrush wands?

2858
02:08:35,979 --> 02:08:38,399
RYAN: Yeah, I start brushing my teeth with a wand.

2859
02:08:38,399 --> 02:08:40,819
My toothbrush was a wand the whole time!

2860
02:08:40,819 --> 02:08:41,799
What the-- What?

2861
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:43,260
KRIS: Wha--!

2862
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:45,240
RYAN: I'm a real wizard!

2863
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:47,079
KRIS: Ah... And you fly away.

2864
02:08:47,079 --> 02:08:48,380
JERRY: In the morning and at night.

2865
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,359
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: Right?

2866
02:08:49,359 --> 02:08:52,279
KRIS: I want to do another arcana check on this cat.

2867
02:08:52,279 --> 02:08:54,460
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Examine it. KRIS: Let me examine it.

2868
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:56,420
KRIS: Do I got anything good-- Oh! I'm going to use advantage on this.

2869
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:57,260
JERRY: You should.

2870
02:08:58,060 --> 02:08:59,220
AMY: Somebody likes you.

2871
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:00,400
KRIS: Don't need to. 20!

2872
02:09:00,979 --> 02:09:03,059
JERRY: You could do another roll again. Because it's good to do that.

2873
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:04,860
AMY: Let's just see. KRIS: You want me to? All right.

2874
02:09:04,859 --> 02:09:09,279
KRIS: I'll do it. I just want to see what my-- Where the heck is it? I just want to see what my modifier was.

2875
02:09:10,579 --> 02:09:11,899
KRIS: They're both excellent. JERRY: Oh jeez.

2876
02:09:11,899 --> 02:09:14,019
KRIS: 23 is going to be my number.

2877
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:15,739
KRIS: Ar-ca-nah! JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

2878
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:22,619
JERRY: So you think that this little statuette,

2879
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:26,439
when installed on to the cart--

2880
02:09:27,399 --> 02:09:29,359
the cart of your choosing, obviously--

2881
02:09:29,979 --> 02:09:35,619
confers a Silence spell on the wheels.

2882
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:38,360
KATE: Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Ah... RYAN: Stealth cart.

2883
02:09:38,359 --> 02:09:42,639
AMY: These are awesome. But then maybe the owl does something too! We can swap them out.

2884
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:44,640
JERRY: Yeah. Take a look.

2885
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:47,320
KRIS: May I? Shall I? JERRY: Take a look. Yeah, yeah. It's--

2886
02:09:47,319 --> 02:09:48,679
JERRY: A bunch of time has passed.

2887
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:51,940
KRIS: Is it within enough of my-- Okay. JERRY: Yeah, yeah. The refractory period is over.

2888
02:09:51,939 --> 02:09:53,899
KRIS: I'm so good at arcana, you guys.

2889
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:55,300
AMY: Are you? KRIS: Nope!

2890
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:56,440
KATE: Wow!

2891
02:09:56,439 --> 02:09:58,119
KRIS: I don't know what this bird-thing is.

2892
02:09:58,119 --> 02:09:59,920
JERRY: You don't even recognize it as a bird.

2893
02:10:00,199 --> 02:10:02,880
JERRY: You like hold it upside down. RYAN: That's a funny looking cat.

2894
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,060
KRIS: I try to gnaw on it.

2895
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:05,920
JERRY: This cat's fucked up you guys. KRIS: Yeah.

2896
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,460
KRIS: We got a good cat and a yuck cat.

2897
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:10,119
JERRY: But that's the situation we have in terms of...

2898
02:10:10,779 --> 02:10:15,139
For the true cart enthusiast there are options available.

2899
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:19,220
KRIS: This is carts aplenty! KATE: So speaking of cart enthusiasts...

2900
02:10:20,579 --> 02:10:24,279
Does Waelvur-- I know he is lit. But...

2901
02:10:24,279 --> 02:10:25,420
JERRY: Oh yeah. Perpetually.

2902
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:26,699
KATE: Can he maybe--

2903
02:10:26,699 --> 02:10:31,139
If we tell him like with this cat casts a Silence spell,

2904
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:36,760
what is your best guess about what an owl statuette might bestow upon a cart?

2905
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:39,280
JERRY: Your guess is that he...

2906
02:10:40,159 --> 02:10:43,359
Your guess-- I mean it didn't come up, obviously, that night.

2907
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:45,680
But there are other topics discussed.

2908
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:47,940
None of them had to do with arcane statuettes.

2909
02:10:48,659 --> 02:10:52,159
Honestly the person to ask would be the guy that runs the Harvest Inn.

2910
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:54,379
He's the one with the statue fetish.

2911
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:56,579
KATE: Yeah he's kind of butt-focused, though. KRIS: What do those confer?

2912
02:10:56,579 --> 02:10:59,619
JERRY: It's a very specific sub-genre.

2913
02:10:59,619 --> 02:11:00,840
KATE: Any owl butts?

2914
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:03,619
KATE: I guess... RYAN: Why does he keep those statues?

2915
02:11:03,619 --> 02:11:06,599
KATE: I mean I guess we can use our brains.

2916
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:09,440
Owls are a symbol of wisdom.

2917
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,720
AMY: Which is somewhat of a misnomer actually...

2918
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:15,020
KATE: Right you told me owls are wicked dumb. AMY: that owls are a smart bird of prey.

2919
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:16,360
KATE: You told me that for years.

2920
02:11:16,359 --> 02:11:18,759
AMY: Sorry. 20 years. KATE: Every time we bring up owls.

2921
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:20,220
AMY: I just want everyone to know!

2922
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:21,380
Stop owl propaganda!

2923
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:23,260
KATE: Okay. So owls are stupid.

2924
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:25,119
JERRY: Yeah! KRIS: Owls suck.

2925
02:11:25,119 --> 02:11:26,479
JERRY: They're bad and dumb.

2926
02:11:26,479 --> 02:11:30,819
AMY: But perhaps it confers one of those ones...

2927
02:11:30,819 --> 02:11:33,380
Isn't there one that's an owl? Maybe there's not one that's an owl.

2928
02:11:33,979 --> 02:11:35,959
No I'm thinking of Eagle's Splendor. No! Owl's Wisdom.

2929
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:38,659
(laughing) Maybe it gives us advantage to wisdom checks.

2930
02:11:38,659 --> 02:11:39,979
KATE: It's a very wise cart.

2931
02:11:39,979 --> 02:11:41,119
KRIS: Do we really want this cart?

2932
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:43,840
And to stop up and have a cool cart?

2933
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:44,860
Or we like our cart?

2934
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:51,020
AMY: I would like to say that as official members of Acquisitions Incorporated wouldn't it really be...

2935
02:11:51,779 --> 02:11:56,719
detriment to the brand to not have the nicest looking cart that we possibly could?

2936
02:11:57,119 --> 02:12:01,739
KRIS: But if we have a fancy cart, as opposed to this business cart,

2937
02:12:01,739 --> 02:12:05,099
people are like, oh they're here to prance around instead of get work done.

2938
02:12:05,699 --> 02:12:08,159
AMY: But the lock is broken on our prisoner's cart,

2939
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:12,779
and this one seemed like it was, as you said, very good construction.

2940
02:12:12,779 --> 02:12:18,399
JERRY: It's very good construction. Obviously, it doesn't have the pragmatism of the prisoner barge.

2941
02:12:18,399 --> 02:12:20,960
AMY: Sure. &gt;&gt; JERRY: But... KRIS: Can I Mend that lock?

2942
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,420
JERRY: It's not bullshit. KRIS: I'm not going to do it, but could I Mend the lock?

2943
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:25,739
JERRY: We can investigate it.

2944
02:12:25,739 --> 02:12:27,639
KRIS: All right. So whatever. KATE: What do you think?

2945
02:12:29,439 --> 02:12:34,339
KATE: I believe that the practical route is best.

2946
02:12:34,439 --> 02:12:37,159
I am a fan of the prison cart.

2947
02:12:37,159 --> 02:12:41,859
I believe that the Gothic cart is ostentatious to a fault.

2948
02:12:41,859 --> 02:12:44,399
I think the ground effects are gaudy.

2949
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:46,279
KRIS: (sighs) We need a decision. KATE: However...

2950
02:12:46,279 --> 02:12:48,819
AMY: I'm so happy that things turned out the way they did!

2951
02:12:48,819 --> 02:12:53,599
KATE: However I do believe that this Percival fella probably wants his shipment of wands.

2952
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:56,220
KATE: So we should at least take that with us. KRIS: Oh yeah, I already took them.

2953
02:12:56,220 --> 02:12:57,640
KATE: As a little side quest.

2954
02:12:57,640 --> 02:12:58,720
KRIS: Oh I wasn't even--

2955
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:02,400
KATE: Oh you didn't even bother saying it. It goes without saying.

2956
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:06,039
AMY: I listen to that and I go, hmm interesting. And just very calmly go, Donaar?

2957
02:13:06,039 --> 02:13:07,659
(laughter)

2958
02:13:07,659 --> 02:13:09,180
RYAN: I like the velvet.

2959
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:10,579
(laughter)

2960
02:13:10,579 --> 02:13:12,180
KATE: Well he is the Decisionist. RYAN: (clapping)

2961
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:15,200
AMY: That's three votes for this monstrosity. KATE: Three votes, yeah.

2962
02:13:15,199 --> 02:13:17,179
KATE: Look how that turned out for you.

2963
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:18,800
You were so worried about it.

2964
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:23,539
AMY: I'm like writing it, I'm like-- I actually keep a very detailed documentation of what we do everyday.

2965
02:13:23,539 --> 02:13:24,779
And it starts with like, dear Omin...

2966
02:13:24,779 --> 02:13:27,139
And it's like, today we found a very good-looking cart.

2967
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:28,660
I'm sure it'll make you proud.

2968
02:13:28,659 --> 02:13:30,220
(laughter)

2969
02:13:30,220 --> 02:13:33,020
KATE: Can't wait to meet you, dad-- I mean, Omin. RYAN: The ground effects.

2970
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:34,940
JERRY: So just to verify.

2971
02:13:36,579 --> 02:13:39,840
We now have a Gothic cart.

2972
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:43,319
You have in your possession an owl statuette.

2973
02:13:43,319 --> 02:13:45,000
KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: That does question mark.

2974
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:47,039
JERRY: Exactly. A cat.

2975
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:49,920
You have catapult mechanism.

2976
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:51,440
AMY: That's coming.

2977
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:52,899
JERRY: And you have the Dancing Lights.

2978
02:13:52,899 --> 02:13:54,679
Now is the spoiler staying back here?

2979
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:57,180
JERRY: Are we going to take the spoiler? RYAN: No, take the spoiler. We'll put a spoiler on it.

2980
02:13:57,180 --> 02:13:58,039
KRIS: Oh that's gauche.

2981
02:13:58,579 --> 02:14:00,600
We're not going to put a spoiler on this beautiful cart.

2982
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:01,780
KATE: At this point?

2983
02:14:01,779 --> 02:14:02,880
(laughter)

2984
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:04,060
KRIS: Come on! RYAN: That's gauche.

2985
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:05,800
KATE: Don't gild the lily, folks!

2986
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:07,500
(laughter) RYAN: That's a hat on a hat.

2987
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:11,380
JERRY: Oh man! There's all-- Oh! I'm not going to say anything. I'm not one of the players.

2988
02:14:11,439 --> 02:14:12,479
KATE: (laughs)

2989
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:14,039
JERRY: I'm not one of the players. KRIS: So excited. All right.

2990
02:14:14,039 --> 02:14:15,960
KRIS: Yeah okay. Yeah you can do it.

2991
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:18,680
AMY: But the spoiler-- I mean, why-- Meta.

2992
02:14:19,399 --> 02:14:24,019
Why would this human, who's sitting behind this thing, describe a spoiler to us if it wasn't--

2993
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:25,640
I don't know! There's got to be something!

2994
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:27,980
Why would you go through the trouble of saying there's a spoiler!

2995
02:14:27,979 --> 02:14:29,179
KATE: It's tight as hell! JERRY: I just want to make sure--

2996
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:30,920
JERRY: I'm just putting content in front of you...

2997
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:32,659
JERRY: and I want to make sure that-- RYAN: It paints a funny visual.

2998
02:14:32,659 --> 02:14:35,800
KRIS: It's a couple nails. You can throw it on there. It's fine. I'm not going to fight this battle.

2999
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:37,760
AMY: What time is it? RYAN: It makes us go faster.

3000
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:39,619
AMY: Yeah. It's true it makes us go faster.

3001
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:43,819
What time of day is it? Is it time where we could stop and do this whole...

3002
02:14:43,819 --> 02:14:45,139
KRIS: It's not cart o' clock.

3003
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:46,780
JERRY: Yeah you think... RYAN: Just about to say that!

3004
02:14:46,779 --> 02:14:47,519
JERRY: It's cart o' clock.

3005
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:52,900
No. You think that there's definitely more travel to do today.

3006
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:55,680
And then you can wrap it up.

3007
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:57,700
KATE: Waelvur. What's your opinion of the spoiler?

3008
02:14:57,920 --> 02:14:59,039
JERRY: "Sweet."

3009
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:00,420
KATE: Same. RYAN: Nice.

3010
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:02,020
RYAN: I high five him.

3011
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:04,760
JERRY: He's way down here, but you kind of go down.

3012
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:05,840
RYAN: I push him into the ground.

3013
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,460
JERRY: You just grind him.

3014
02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:09,979
All right. So now I understand.

3015
02:15:09,979 --> 02:15:12,879
You have a Gothic cart with a cool spoiler.

3016
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:15,880
And chambers full of Dancing Lights beneath.

3017
02:15:16,579 --> 02:15:18,800
You have the owl and cat hood ornament.

3018
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,440
And you have a catapult armature.

3019
02:15:20,619 --> 02:15:25,819
JERRY: All right. You continue on to the east. RYAN: What cart will we see next?

3020
02:15:25,819 --> 02:15:26,979
AMY: Yeah you got to update your sketch.

3021
02:15:26,979 --> 02:15:28,019
JERRY: If only you knew.

3022
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:31,120
Yeah. The cart sketch is going to be updated each time.

3023
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:32,539
KRIS: I'm glad I didn't start drawing that other one.

3024
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:34,500
KRIS: Waste of time. KATE: Augmented. Yeah.

3025
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:38,960
JERRY: Very near to the Stone Bridge.

3026
02:15:40,119 --> 02:15:42,619
It is now plainly visible in the distance.

3027
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:53,800
You can see a cart cruising very quickly across this bridge.

3028
02:15:53,939 --> 02:15:56,139
And then out of sight.

3029
02:15:56,460 --> 02:16:00,319
And then on the left side of the road,

3030
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:05,079
you can see a third cart,

3031
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:07,880
with one of the wheels actually still spinning,

3032
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:11,039
tipped over on the front right.

3033
02:16:12,239 --> 02:16:14,840
KATE: How far away is this escaping cart from us?

3034
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:17,539
JERRY: It is on the other edge of the Stone Bridge.

3035
02:16:17,539 --> 02:16:24,060
You think it would be challenging to keep up with that.

3036
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:26,200
They clearly did not want to be here anymore.

3037
02:16:26,199 --> 02:16:27,300
KATE: How big is the Stone Bridge?

3038
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:28,659
JERRY: The Stone Bridge is massive.

3039
02:16:28,659 --> 02:16:30,920
KATE: Okay. Golden Gate Bridge in size.

3040
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:32,219
JERRY: It's very, very big.

3041
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:37,760
This cart looks like a cart from a story.

3042
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:42,079
It is mostly...

3043
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:45,059
It is basically-- Yes, exactly.

3044
02:16:45,059 --> 02:16:48,939
If you were to transform a pumpkin into a cart...

3045
02:16:49,299 --> 02:16:51,340
But it has certain advantages.

3046
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:54,559
Insofar as it is completely round.

3047
02:16:56,360 --> 02:17:01,400
Windows placed, evenly spaced around it.

3048
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:09,020
It has where you would tie off the rope,

3049
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:12,979
it has a crystal ball...

3050
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,379
AMY: I ain't grabbing that.

3051
02:17:15,379 --> 02:17:16,439
JERRY: in the center.

3052
02:17:16,739 --> 02:17:18,780
KRIS: Are we stopping for the cart?

3053
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:19,760
I guess we're not going to make--

3054
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:20,639
JERRY: I'm just going to let you know--

3055
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:23,019
There is a-- I'm just going to let you know what you see on here.

3056
02:17:23,139 --> 02:17:30,000
There is a chamber underneath the rear carriage,

3057
02:17:31,979 --> 02:17:39,579
that you poke it a little bit and it sprays something slick.

3058
02:17:39,579 --> 02:17:40,799
Some slick fluid.

3059
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:42,840
RYAN: Some Spy Hunter stuff. JERRY: Right?

3060
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:43,639
KRIS: Yeah.

3061
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:48,460
JERRY: And so you get back. Obviously it's disgusting.

3062
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:52,399
Inside this cart...

3063
02:17:52,639 --> 02:17:55,099
as I say there's a central table,

3064
02:17:55,500 --> 02:18:03,420
and then there are different workspaces around the central piece.

3065
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:09,180
On opposite corners you got two quarter circle couches.

3066
02:18:09,659 --> 02:18:15,719
And then you have something that looks like an alchemical station. Titration. Things of that kind.

3067
02:18:15,719 --> 02:18:17,760
A small library in this section.

3068
02:18:19,459 --> 02:18:25,559
And... It's not quite as-- Like the construction is opulent.

3069
02:18:25,559 --> 02:18:26,939
There is also a minibar.

3070
02:18:29,979 --> 02:18:34,579
But near the front where you would communicate with the driver,

3071
02:18:34,659 --> 02:18:37,780
you can see a small skull...

3072
02:18:38,819 --> 02:18:42,159
that is sort of mumbling and muttering to itself.

3073
02:18:42,639 --> 02:18:46,639
It has a little ring of metal...

3074
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:54,020
attaching its upper teeth and its lower teeth.

3075
02:18:54,459 --> 02:18:57,159
So it's trying to communicate,

3076
02:18:57,159 --> 02:19:01,039
but there is this ring that is preventing it from speaking.

3077
02:19:01,719 --> 02:19:03,359
AMY: We got to pull on that ring.

3078
02:19:03,639 --> 02:19:04,819
KRIS: Got to tug that ring.

3079
02:19:04,819 --> 02:19:06,119
KATE: Free those mandibles up.

3080
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:07,820
RYAN: I want to examine that crystal ball.

3081
02:19:08,299 --> 02:19:11,039
AMY: Yeah let's do that-- Wait any there any people in here?

3082
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:11,860
JERRY: Mm-mmm. AMY: Oh they're-- it's gone.

3083
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,180
KATE: Just a skull trying to talk to us?

3084
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:14,399
KRIS: This skull's part of the cart.

3085
02:19:14,399 --> 02:19:16,520
KRIS: It's like a feature of the cart. JERRY: Yeah.

3086
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:19,739
JERRY: Yeah but it could be removed, you think. KRIS: Oh okay.

3087
02:19:19,739 --> 02:19:22,379
AMY: What would look better on a goth cart than a chattering skull?

3088
02:19:22,379 --> 02:19:25,319
KRIS: This is dope! I love this cart! RYAN: Take that minibar.

3089
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:28,380
KATE: Oh my god. KRIS: MTV's Carts.

3090
02:19:28,379 --> 02:19:29,779
(laughter)

3091
02:19:29,819 --> 02:19:33,059
KRIS: I'm going to go ahead and pull that ring.

3092
02:19:33,059 --> 02:19:34,260
KATE: Yeah, I want to talk to that skull.

3093
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:36,940
JERRY: It starts to sing very loud.

3094
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:38,360
RYAN: Oh it's a radio. Nice!

3095
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:39,899
KRIS: What's it singing?

3096
02:19:39,899 --> 02:19:41,520
JERRY: It is singing... KRIS: Anything that we know?

3097
02:19:41,559 --> 02:19:43,859
JERRY: Yeah it is singing a...

3098
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:46,940
elven birthday song.

3099
02:19:47,659 --> 02:19:49,760
RYAN: (singing) Friday, Friday...

3100
02:19:50,159 --> 02:19:51,360
(laughter)

3101
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:53,140
AMY: Party bus. KRIS: They're always born on a Friday.

3102
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:54,300
KATE: Is it your birthday?

3103
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,479
AMY: Not today.

3104
02:19:56,500 --> 02:19:59,399
KRIS: How me make ring go back on?

3105
02:19:59,399 --> 02:20:00,659
(laughter)

3106
02:20:00,659 --> 02:20:02,520
JERRY: So it's just-- (incomprehensible singing sounds)

3107
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:03,479
You're just like...

3108
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:05,219
KRIS: Yeah. (grunt) Okay.

3109
02:20:05,479 --> 02:20:07,619
JERRY: Then I guess it's just-- (humming)

3110
02:20:07,620 --> 02:20:08,820
KRIS: It's just back to business.

3111
02:20:09,219 --> 02:20:11,119
Let's look at this crystal ball.

3112
02:20:11,219 --> 02:20:12,239
So that's notable.

3113
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:13,299
JERRY: Go ahead. RYAN: Yeah.

3114
02:20:13,579 --> 02:20:15,399
KRIS: Arcana again... AMY: Who doesn't want to take that?

3115
02:20:16,079 --> 02:20:17,840
KRIS: (blows raspberry) Trash.

3116
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:20,260
JERRY: You don't know. You don't even know what balls are.

3117
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:21,639
KATE: Should I check out the library?

3118
02:20:21,639 --> 02:20:22,680
JERRY: Yes absolutely.

3119
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:23,700
KATE: Tell me about the library.

3120
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:24,780
RYAN: Just take it all with us.

3121
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:29,760
JERRY: The library has a number of books on history.

3122
02:20:30,459 --> 02:20:39,199
A couple tasteful, you would describe it as almost curatorial selections of poetry from different regions.

3123
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:40,760
KRIS: Hmm.

3124
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:41,739
KATE: Okay.

3125
02:20:42,479 --> 02:20:45,359
You've mentioned that the last two carts that there are workspaces.

3126
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:49,040
KATE: Can you describe what that means exactly? JERRY: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

3127
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:56,080
JERRY: So one of the corners is entirely given over to goofy-looking magical bullshit.

3128
02:20:58,020 --> 02:20:58,520
KATE: Nice.

3129
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:01,420
JERRY: Potion manufacture. Basically magical cooking.

3130
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:15,159
And then this library area also has a stenographer's setup for duplication, transcription, things like that.

3131
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:20,699
KATE: Okay. Does it seem above board? Or is there evidence of illegal goings-on?

3132
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:22,000
JERRY: It doesn't seem illegal.

3133
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
KATE: Okay. Okay. RYAN: This is like a Breaking Bad RV?

3134
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,739
JERRY: (laughing) Yeah. KATE: Exactly. Exactly.

3135
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:26,880
KATE: Okay.

3136
02:21:27,739 --> 02:21:28,899
Seems cool.

3137
02:21:30,559 --> 02:21:34,539
No blood? No evidence of violence?

3138
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:37,280
JERRY: You don't see anything like that in this cart.

3139
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:39,280
RYAN: Can you see any logos?

3140
02:21:39,899 --> 02:21:42,619
KRIS: Yeah. I wonder if this was targeted. JERRY: The McDonald's logo.

3141
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:43,880
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: McDonald's logo.

3142
02:21:43,879 --> 02:21:45,319
JERRY: (laughing) No, no. Don't write that down.

3143
02:21:45,319 --> 02:21:46,879
KATE: (laughing) It's too late.

3144
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:48,219
JERRY: There's nothing--

3145
02:21:48,219 --> 02:21:50,340
RYAN: Like the Percival-- Anymore of that Percival logo anywhere?

3146
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:52,780
JERRY: No, no, no. Nothing like that. KATE: No, this is not Percival's cart.

3147
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:53,680
KATE/AMY: Okay.

3148
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:54,639
KRIS: Hmm.

3149
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,920
KATE: Okay and you tried to do something with the crystal ball.

3150
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:58,979
KATE: Nothing. KRIS: Couldn't figure it out.

3151
02:21:58,979 --> 02:21:59,799
JERRY: It was too dumb. KATE: Okay.

3152
02:21:59,799 --> 02:22:02,299
KRIS: We're going to take it with us though. KATE: Can I try a perception check on it?

3153
02:22:02,739 --> 02:22:03,920
JERRY: Yeah sure. KATE: Okay.

3154
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:05,659
KATE: 18?

3155
02:22:05,879 --> 02:22:09,279
JERRY: Yeah so you can-- As you're looking through it,

3156
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:18,540
you know that people use devices like this the same way that K'thriss uses his focus.

3157
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:22,260
I mean you know that there's different scales of interaction with this type of thing.

3158
02:22:22,639 --> 02:22:25,619
But even just looking through it,

3159
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:30,300
you can see all outside the cart.

3160
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:33,560
Like just at the base level.

3161
02:22:33,559 --> 02:22:34,799
KRIS: Like a backup cam!

3162
02:22:34,799 --> 02:22:35,799
KATE: Yeah. RYAN: Backup cam. Nice.

3163
02:22:35,799 --> 02:22:37,000
RYAN: I thought it was going to be GPS.

3164
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,420
JERRY: You're not even trained to use it.

3165
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:44,139
And you can look at it and get a sense.

3166
02:22:44,139 --> 02:22:49,019
You can turn around and be looking outside the cart from each perspective.

3167
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:50,060
KATE: That's extremely tight.

3168
02:22:50,059 --> 02:22:51,939
KRIS: Does it transfer to other carts?

3169
02:22:51,940 --> 02:22:53,840
KRIS: Or is it just this cart? KATE: Yeah can we take it?

3170
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:54,960
JERRY: Try. KATE: And move it? Okay.

3171
02:22:54,959 --> 02:22:56,079
KATE: I'll pick it up. JERRY: You break it.

3172
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:57,579
RYAN: Oh. &gt;&gt; KATE: Sorry. JERRY: No.

3173
02:22:57,579 --> 02:22:59,020
(laughter)

3174
02:22:59,020 --> 02:23:00,680
AMY: I was so upset! RYAN: The house is on fire!

3175
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:02,840
AMY: I was like, son of a...

3176
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:05,020
JERRY: No, it's fine.

3177
02:23:05,159 --> 02:23:08,119
There's a bolt on each side,

3178
02:23:08,319 --> 02:23:10,479
but you think you can remove them

3179
02:23:10,479 --> 02:23:13,279
JERRY: and withdraw the device. KATE: Okay.

3180
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:15,940
AMY: Take it. These are slottable buffs. KATE: I'll do that, yeah.

3181
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:16,940
JERRY: You break it.

3182
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:17,800
KATE: For real? JERRY: No.

3183
02:23:17,799 --> 02:23:18,619
(laughter)

3184
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:20,540
AMY: God every time! KATE: Damn it, Jerry!

3185
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:23,720
JERRY: It's fine. No, no. You're able to withdraw it.

3186
02:23:23,719 --> 02:23:33,219
You think that that crystal ball could be mounted very easily where you would wrap the...

3187
02:23:33,479 --> 02:23:34,340
RYAN: Presents.

3188
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,600
JERRY: the tethers around.

3189
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:38,260
AMY: At the gift wrapping station in our goth cart. RYAN: In our goth cart yeah.

3190
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:40,979
JERRY: At the gift wrapping station at the mall. KATE: So you guys are still into goth cart.

3191
02:23:40,979 --> 02:23:41,840
JERRY: You're still gothing.

3192
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:43,559
RYAN: Like, yeah! We're just going to take the cool stuff from this one--

3193
02:23:43,559 --> 02:23:45,879
KRIS: I'm in the-- KATE: This one's even cooler than the goth cart.

3194
02:23:45,879 --> 02:23:47,479
AMY: In what way? &gt;&gt; RYAN: How so? KATE: It's bigger.

3195
02:23:47,479 --> 02:23:50,439
KATE: There's an alchemical station. We can make potions. There's magical cooking. There's a library!

3196
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:53,200
KATE: There's like a stenographer's-- JERRY: This is my fantasy!

3197
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:54,420
(laughter)

3198
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:55,920
KATE: Arguing the merits of carts! KRIS: Cart fight!

3199
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:58,819
AMY: I am tantalized by the stenographer's station.

3200
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,899
AMY: As I have my bagful of documancy. KATE: Documancer.

3201
02:24:02,899 --> 02:24:04,000
AMY: I'm like-- (sound of consternation)

3202
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,579
RYAN: This is like a Cinderella pumpkin cart though?

3203
02:24:06,579 --> 02:24:14,479
KRIS: I'm already taking some of the alcohol from the minibar to return to our friend.

3204
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:16,299
Because he's been good to us.

3205
02:24:16,299 --> 02:24:18,159
JERRY: He's working hard. AMY: He's been good and dry.

3206
02:24:18,159 --> 02:24:19,039
KATE/KRIS: Yeah.

3207
02:24:19,579 --> 02:24:21,340
KRIS: I don't want to metagame. AMY: I'm fine.

3208
02:24:21,500 --> 02:24:23,340
AMY: I think our black cart's very cool.

3209
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:25,600
KATE: (sighs) All right well we're going to vote.

3210
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:26,659
AMY: Yeah okay. Let's vote.

3211
02:24:26,659 --> 02:24:27,899
It matches the horse.

3212
02:24:27,899 --> 02:24:28,779
KRIS: Is that going to work? RYAN: All right.

3213
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:30,780
KATE: This new cart's way better.

3214
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:31,940
RYAN: All right. Put it to a vote. KATE: And bigger.

3215
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:35,340
KATE: And better and fits more couches. The gothic one only has one couch.

3216
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,139
KATE: This has two couches! RYAN: Are we going to vote or are we going to talk?

3217
02:24:37,139 --> 02:24:38,099
KATE: Okay.

3218
02:24:38,459 --> 02:24:40,599
All right. I want the library cart.

3219
02:24:41,299 --> 02:24:43,519
KRIS: I want the gothic cart. I don't care. KATE: Oh my god.

3220
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:44,860
RYAN: I vote prisoner cart. No.

3221
02:24:44,860 --> 02:24:46,239
(laughter)

3222
02:24:46,239 --> 02:24:49,399
RYAN: We're going to go back and we're going to get the prisoner cart. I changed my mind.

3223
02:24:49,399 --> 02:24:51,239
KRIS: I'm going to live here in this cart.

3224
02:24:51,239 --> 02:24:53,039
JERRY: Exactly. All right.

3225
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:56,500
I think I understand what your intentions are.

3226
02:24:57,719 --> 02:25:05,619
Here very near the geometric heap of the Stone Bridge.

3227
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:09,980
You can see evidence that people do park by here.

3228
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:12,860
Not just to make out. They rest here.

3229
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:14,380
KATE: Really? &gt;&gt; JERRY: Yeah. AMY: But also to make out.

3230
02:25:14,379 --> 02:25:17,219
JERRY: But also-- Yeah. Making out is a possibility.

3231
02:25:17,219 --> 02:25:19,359
That's how we started this adventure. We can wrap it up that way as well.

3232
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,880
KATE: This is our horniest adventure yet.

3233
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:24,219
JERRY: Oh yeah. Hey listen. From here on out, just fuckfest.

3234
02:25:24,219 --> 02:25:27,559
RYAN: Yeah, our app is in a park and ride in the high weeds?

3235
02:25:27,559 --> 02:25:29,100
JERRY: Oh yeah this is just-- RYAN: Bad things.

3236
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:31,479
JERRY: Yeah there's no party like a Holkins party.

3237
02:25:31,959 --> 02:25:36,279
And so you're able to break camp.

3238
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:43,299
Waelvur immediately-- fully empowered by the minibar.

3239
02:25:43,299 --> 02:25:44,420
KRIS: (robot activating sounds)

3240
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:46,079
JERRY: Yeah, he has reached his-- RYAN: Engorged.

3241
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:47,780
JERRY: He has reached his final form.

3242
02:25:49,479 --> 02:25:52,799
He's going bat-shit out there.

3243
02:25:53,239 --> 02:25:54,899
In terms of the...

3244
02:25:55,739 --> 02:26:00,100
You're interested in which of these weapon devices?

3245
02:26:00,239 --> 02:26:03,280
RYAN: I say, pick it clean. Take what we can take.

3246
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:05,820
JERRY: Yeah. And you want him to try and install these things on there?

3247
02:26:05,819 --> 02:26:06,680
RYAN/AMY: Yeah.

3248
02:26:06,860 --> 02:26:12,260
JERRY: And he's like looking at all this junk that you have piled up.

3249
02:26:12,299 --> 02:26:13,219
And he's like...

3250
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:19,199
"Am I installing the wands?"

3251
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:22,079
KRIS/RYAN/AMY: No. RYAN: What, are you an idiot?

3252
02:26:22,079 --> 02:26:23,899
AMY: (laughing) Smack him. RYAN: I smack him.

3253
02:26:23,899 --> 02:26:26,619
KRIS: I want the wands as the spokes of the wheels.

3254
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:27,720
(laughter)

3255
02:26:27,719 --> 02:26:30,260
I just want spells firing off as we roll.

3256
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:31,620
JERRY: Chain gun? AMY: It's like a Roman candle.

3257
02:26:32,459 --> 02:26:35,219
KATE: I want to fashion stilts so I'm taller than everybody.

3258
02:26:35,219 --> 02:26:36,340
(laughter)

3259
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,460
KRIS: We can get a pogo wand.

3260
02:26:38,459 --> 02:26:39,659
JERRY: He's like, "No? No wands?"

3261
02:26:39,659 --> 02:26:40,739
AMY: No. No wands.

3262
02:26:40,739 --> 02:26:42,139
RYAN: No. We're just going to keep them all in the box.

3263
02:26:42,139 --> 02:26:44,859
JERRY: "All right well I just-- Because they could..." KRIS: Oh, no. That's good.

3264
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:46,900
AMY: Wait, wait, wait. They could what? RYAN: No, that was a great question.

3265
02:26:46,899 --> 02:26:49,020
JERRY: He's like... On the side he's like...

3266
02:26:50,299 --> 02:26:52,099
RYAN: You're going to panel the cart in wands?

3267
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:53,760
KRIS: Yeah how-- RYAN: Why I ought to...

3268
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:56,460
AMY: Make the AI logo out of wands.

3269
02:26:56,459 --> 02:26:59,639
JERRY: He shrugs, "It's fine. I got plenty of work."

3270
02:26:59,639 --> 02:27:00,799
"It's fine for me."

3271
02:27:00,799 --> 02:27:03,099
AMY: Do we want the spoiler? Or do we want the catapult?

3272
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:06,360
KATE: We want the chamber in the rear with the slick fluid that sprays us.

3273
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:08,200
We want the ground...

3274
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:09,220
JERRY/RYAN: Ground effects.

3275
02:27:09,219 --> 02:27:10,619
KATE: from... Yeah we got that one.

3276
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:12,300
JERRY: Is the skull staying or going?

3277
02:27:12,299 --> 02:27:13,979
KATE: It's definitely staying. RYAN: Staying!

3278
02:27:13,979 --> 02:27:17,199
KATE: Can you communicate with it psychically and see if it has any useful knowledge?

3279
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:18,820
KRIS: Oh that's a great idea. RYAN: Eh we'll figure it out later.

3280
02:27:18,819 --> 02:27:23,119
KRIS: If I do... what the heck is it called? Is it intelligent? AMY: It's not making any noise. Just bring it.

3281
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:26,040
KRIS: Does it know a language? Can I communicate with it? RYAN: You can change the station!

3282
02:27:26,040 --> 02:27:29,480
KATE: If for some reason that those mandibular ring...

3283
02:27:29,479 --> 02:27:32,239
if that pops off and he just starts singing,

3284
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:34,819
he's going to give us away from a mile away.

3285
02:27:34,819 --> 02:27:36,979
KRIS: Yeah can I communicate with the skull? KATE: He's very loud.

3286
02:27:36,979 --> 02:27:38,079
KATE: Psychically. JERRY: You can try to.

3287
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:39,219
KRIS: Skull.

3288
02:27:39,879 --> 02:27:41,099
I address with you.

3289
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:43,159
AMY: Friend. RYAN: Friend. Yeah, call it friend.

3290
02:27:43,159 --> 02:27:44,600
KRIS: Friend. RYAN: Friend skull.

3291
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:49,079
KRIS: Friend-- What was probably a friend.

3292
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:52,620
I pop that ring out.

3293
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:54,120
What other songs do you know?

3294
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:55,780
JERRY: "What is your request?"

3295
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:57,800
KATE: (gasps) It takes requests! KRIS: Oh.

3296
02:27:57,799 --> 02:28:00,420
AMY: Oh my god it can vamp-- RYAN: All Along The Watchtower!

3297
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:01,700
KRIS: Do you know Silence?

3298
02:28:03,159 --> 02:28:04,879
JERRY: He opens up his mouth...

3299
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:08,440
AMY: (laughing) That was-- KRIS: Fam, we good to go!

3300
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:10,520
(laughter) KRIS: We're taking this skull with us.

3301
02:28:11,059 --> 02:28:13,039
RYAN: Put the clamp on him, just to be safe.

3302
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:15,460
KRIS: Yeah, we'll go ahead and just tuck that in.

3303
02:28:15,459 --> 02:28:17,539
KRIS: All right that's-- JERRY: It's like a duckbill, like...

3304
02:28:17,659 --> 02:28:18,979
(laughter)

3305
02:28:18,979 --> 02:28:20,199
JERRY: It's just open.

3306
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:22,700
KRIS: Do you know John Cage's 4'33"? KATE: Hang him from the rearview mirror.

3307
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:24,320
JERRY: Exactly. AMY: Yeah hang him from the rearview mirror.

3308
02:28:24,319 --> 02:28:28,000
JERRY: So while you're interacting with this skull,

3309
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,899
which is happy to be there,

3310
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:35,360
Waelvur is using some of the boards that he had secured previously

3311
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:43,260
to create something like a support for the catapult that fits on the side.

3312
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:48,380
So there is on the right side of the Gothic cart...

3313
02:28:48,379 --> 02:28:49,679
AMY: It's like a camper. JERRY: Yeah.

3314
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:52,319
JERRY: He's like, "Something like this?"

3315
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:55,900
KRIS: I love it.

3316
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:58,360
KRIS: Love what you done with the-- RYAN: Trails behind?

3317
02:28:58,360 --> 02:29:00,560
JERRY: No. It's like a sidecar.

3318
02:29:00,559 --> 02:29:02,479
RYAN: Oh okay. Better. Yes.

3319
02:29:03,139 --> 02:29:05,279
KRIS: This is a wacky cart! RYAN: Yeah.

3320
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:06,739
AMY: Which is great. JERRY: Wacky Races.

3321
02:29:06,739 --> 02:29:08,360
RYAN: This is like the Wacky Races cart, yeah!

3322
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:10,800
JERRY: Exactly, exactly. RYAN: A hodgepodge nonsense car.

3323
02:29:10,799 --> 02:29:13,099
JERRY: It's a heap. It's a heap of crazy nonsense.

3324
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:14,640
AMY: It's fine. We'll soup it up as we go.

3325
02:29:14,639 --> 02:29:15,559
RYAN: Can we put it on the top?

3326
02:29:15,559 --> 02:29:17,879
JERRY: So it's been installed? AMY: No. Spoiler goes on top.

3327
02:29:17,879 --> 02:29:20,599
JERRY: It's been installed on the side.

3328
02:29:21,739 --> 02:29:25,520
There's a gentle glow beneath the cart.

3329
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:30,399
Grease canister installed in the back. Tastefully.

3330
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:31,579
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: Hidden.

3331
02:29:31,579 --> 02:29:32,399
AMY/KRIS: Sure.

3332
02:29:32,399 --> 02:29:34,180
JERRY: You know, underneath. RYAN: How do we engage that?

3333
02:29:34,180 --> 02:29:35,819
JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: I don't know.

3334
02:29:35,819 --> 02:29:37,779
JERRY: He's definitely gauging it out.

3335
02:29:37,780 --> 02:29:38,920
RYAN: But how do you turn it on?

3336
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:40,559
JERRY: This is a fantasy for him. KRIS: He'll solve it.

3337
02:29:40,559 --> 02:29:42,439
AMY: There will be like a pulley inside. RYAN: Is there like a button?

3338
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:44,220
KATE: Waelvur will let us know. KRIS: Let him do it.

3339
02:29:44,219 --> 02:29:48,399
RYAN: Okay. I hit him! Because everyone's giving me crap.

3340
02:29:48,399 --> 02:29:50,479
(laughter) AMY: I take out all my--

3341
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:53,260
JERRY: People are fucking with me about this shit all the time.

3342
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:57,640
So you're able to put all this stuff together.

3343
02:29:57,639 --> 02:29:59,719
He doesn't seem to need a whole lot of sleep.

3344
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:04,220
Waelvur. I think he does most of his best sleeping during the day.

3345
02:30:04,219 --> 02:30:05,319
KRIS: Yeah. KATE: (clicks tongue)

3346
02:30:05,319 --> 02:30:06,239
AMY: (whispering) Goddamn Rosie.

3347
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:08,940
JERRY: So you... KRIS: Rosie let them in.

3348
02:30:10,860 --> 02:30:13,340
JERRY: As you wake up...

3349
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:19,079
you wake up to the sound of a cart...

3350
02:30:19,579 --> 02:30:21,659
rolling over the Stone Bridge.

3351
02:30:24,639 --> 02:30:26,420
And let's get some perception checks.

3352
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,000
KATE: Yes, sir. RYAN: I am not perceptive.

3353
02:30:29,659 --> 02:30:31,760
KRIS: Whoa. Did it count? KATE: Whoa. Hey there.

3354
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:33,520
RYAN: Three. So... KATE: That's a nat 20.

3355
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:34,840
KATE: I'm going to count that for you. KRIS: Okay.

3356
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:36,319
AMY: I was about to say I got an 11. KATE: I got 21.

3357
02:30:36,319 --> 02:30:37,440
AMY: Oh yeah. He got it.

3358
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:38,260
JERRY: 21? KATE: Mm-hmm.

3359
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:40,840
RYAN: I got a three. So I see like no...

3360
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:42,979
JERRY: So you're taking a look at it...

3361
02:30:42,979 --> 02:30:45,219
You can see the cart. You can see sort of a...

3362
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:47,860
It's early morning.

3363
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:50,340
They clearly got an early start to the day.

3364
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:58,340
Very, very stiff body. Probably the cold morning.

3365
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:01,239
You can see that there are...

3366
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:05,799
there's one set of reins that goes to the driver.

3367
02:31:06,139 --> 02:31:10,680
And another set of reins that go inside the cart.

3368
02:31:10,959 --> 02:31:12,339
KRIS: Wow. RYAN: Nice.

3369
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:14,960
JERRY: That is the end of our adventure for today.

3370
02:31:14,959 --> 02:31:16,000
KATE: What? RYAN: Nice cart!

3371
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,780
JERRY: Mm-hmm. It's true. It's true. KATE: Oh my god.

3372
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:21,500
JERRY: Hey! We're going to run a little thingamajig.

3373
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:25,520
And then we're going to come back for Table Talk right after that.

3374
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:26,860
So come back and see us.

3375
02:31:28,059 --> 02:31:29,260
AMY: Bye, everybody!
