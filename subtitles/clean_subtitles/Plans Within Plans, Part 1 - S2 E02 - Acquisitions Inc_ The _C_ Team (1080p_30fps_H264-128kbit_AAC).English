00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,379
Hello. I'm Jeriford K. Horkims. \direct{offscreen} Well no, they didn't have

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,969
didn't finish their song! Here you do the

00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,019
song...

\kate We did it hello okay okay

\kate I

00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,399
finished them here

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,530
I'm Tycho Brahe of Penny Arcade

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,929
and PAX. I'm also a Ominifus Hereward

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,689
Dran, CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated, but

00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,188
today I'm Jerry Holkins, and I'm here to run a

00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,649
game of Dungeons and Dragons for my hand--

00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:14,989
my _friends_ specifically...

\kate Were you gonan say ...?

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,130
\ryan _Best_ friends.

\dm Episode 2, Season 2 of

00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:19,739
Acquisitions Incorporated: The C-Team. To

00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:25,530
my right, I am joined by Dragonborn

00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:29,669
narcissist, Donaar Blit'zen.

\kthriss \direct{imitating a crowd} Yeah! Yeah! 

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,469
\dm Yes, yes, the Doppler effect.

\someone This is just self

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,359
high-fiving over, and over again, and it

00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,908
is in it 

I never even thought about that.

00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,609
\dm To the right of my right, repping the

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,609
natural world, Walnut Dankgrass!
\direct{Trystan does a wing flapping motion with her hands}
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,719
Is that just for the is it just for

00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,600
today's episode, or is it--

 I don't know

00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,590
find out I was guys 

\ryan How did you do it?

00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,059
\dm I got it cranked up. 

\trystan It's gonna take a

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,000
game or two to find out rhythm, guys.

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,710
\dm The watering pot was very good. I like that.

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,629
\dm oh hello To my left, not your grandma's

00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,699
grandma, except for those rare cases

00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:11,539
where she _is_ your grandma's grandma

00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:17,549
Rosie Beestinger. Fresh from the

00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:22,620
Acquisitions Incorporated main stage!
\direct{Everyone doing a weird hand motion}
\kate Here it is, it's happened all day and all

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,939
night!

\dm Going crazy on a rod, it's an

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,009
incredible new fitness regimen,

00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,469
only available here at the C-Team.

00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,479
To the left of my left, emerging as

00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:40,110
though from a mist shroud, K'thriss

00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:42,089
Drow'b! 

\direct{Kris does a weird hand motion for his character as well}

\kate Season 2, new moves!.

\dm Now, there is some nerd

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,320
that I have to get out of the way

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,229
first.

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,789
Before we jump in whole hog, or with

00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:51,299
both feet, or however you want to jump in --

00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:53,099
\ryan Both hogs.
\dm Intentionally.

\kris Get inside that

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,000
hog! 

\dm Get all your hogs, bring them with you,

00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:59,609
jump-- they can jump too. 

\direct {addressing the audience} So just like just

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,150
like last time you may have recalled

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,760
that you were able to grant boons in

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,860
your role as members of the Shadow

00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,689
Council. You were able to grant boons to

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,280
our players that they can leverage

00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:15,389
either as advantages on rolls, or special

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,530
abilities that are unique to each

00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:21,839
character. That's still true. The values

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,419
are there, you'll see them in the UI, but

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,689
when you donate bits, when you cheer in

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,059
there, if you use hashtag and then the

00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,680
character's name, these will be

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,569
apportioned directly to them. They can

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,420
choose to use them either as abilities

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,219
or as advantage, but there's another

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,909
thing that happens which is all kinds of

00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:44,519
crazy, which is that _I_ have a bar\marginnote{referring to a bar in the UI on stream that can be filled as the viewers donate} -- the

00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,789
players cannot see it -- but I have a bar,

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,289
hoho, it's just mine. It's a special bar

00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:53,219
called the Cauldron, and I have a special

00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:54,689
table I can roll on where sometimes good

00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,169
and sometimes bad things happen to

00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:59,909
players, based on the aggregate

00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:02,579
bits. So it hits a certain value, then I

00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:06,120
get to do something cool. Cool being

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,569
defined by me.

\kate For once. Finally some cool shit happens.

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,709
\dm Not others.

\ryan Yeah 
\kate Sorry.

00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:16,409
\kris No parents allowed!

\dm So that's my

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,439
Cauldron. Early voting: so last season

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:24,120
people could vote during the show, which

00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,319
was very fun right? But we want to extend

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,300
the window a little bit.

00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,000
So now voting will be available starting

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,590
on Monday, so if you're somebody who

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,269
watches the show over the weekend or

00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:35,129
you catch it on YouTube or on podcast,

00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:36,599
you'll be able to put your votes in,

00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:38,250
because these votes have changed a lot

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,810
of really important things in the game. A

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,699
lot of things -- if you're not familiar

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,589
with that part of the show, a lot of

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,839
characters in the show are named by it,

00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,459
there's been a lot of interesting forks

00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,609
in the road that have drastically

00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:53,579
changed the campaign, and that is all due

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,919
to the works of the Shadow Council. So

00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:59,159
you'll be able to sign in to aq-inc.com

00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,469
with your Twitch handle. Do your

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,790
voting right there. If you change your

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,710
mind later you can vote and it'll just

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,460
overwrite it. It's fine. Our engineer

00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:10,168
rules. So that's gonna be pretty sweet.

00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,219
And then, but the natural twenty

00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:15,449
giveaways: two things, two things. For one,

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,970
Gavin _murdered_

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,089
these emotes. They look so good. They

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,330
look so good.

\kate I haven't seen the final ones.

\dm Oh, they're straight

00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,409
murda, but, but here's the dealio:

00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:28,019
when a natural twenty is rolled,

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,640
two things should occur: 1) you should

00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,959
use the womp-womp-womp

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:36,240
emote. That's vital. But also, just like

00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,449
last time, we are gonna give you cool

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,329
nowe If you are not a sub, we welcome

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,610
you into the Shadow Council even still.

00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:46,560
But you get a $20 gift certificate to

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,620
the Penny Arcade store, where it has

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,418
all kinds of Acq Inc stuff. Subs get a

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,500
signed Elderwood Hexchests, or

00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:58,279
something cool from Level Up Dice that

00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,279
will debut next week.

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,990
\ryan Subs get trubs!

\dm No, they get the opposite of trubs.

00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:08,779
\kate They get hugs!

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:12,030
\dm Thank you.

\ryan Subs get snubs.

\kate Nope. No, snugs!

00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:14,399
\dm This branding is subpar. I mean

00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,239
I want to minimize that now, so

00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,750
here's what's going on:

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,250
\ryan Subs get rubs?
\dm So if you are new to

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,240
the C-Team you should recognize that

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:29,279
this dynamic is a _constant_ feature.

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,840
\ryan Fan favorite.

\dm No, we play our own version

00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,638
of Dungeons and Dragons pretty much like

00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:38,879
everybody else does; 

\kate Yeah. 

\dm We crank up the

00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,009
romance. We play a game that's erotically

00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,689
charged. No, that's not true either. 

\kate Well...

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,689
\dm It is _occasionally_ erotically

00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:47,759
charged. But it's like this.

00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:51,779
Hopefully you have caught

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,970
up with the last episode that debuted at

00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,029
PAX South. It's of course up on the Penny

00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:00,120
Arcade YouTube, and on the Twitcher, if you're

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,939
into that sort of thing. But the main

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,658
thing that we need to know is in the

00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:10,439
current incarnation, it would appear that

00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:13,079
Brahma Sigrid Lutier-- there is some

00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:17,848
evidence that Brahma Sigrid Lutier

00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:20,908
underwent _some_ kind of a change as she

00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:24,779
remained behind in Scala to resist an

00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:27,209
incursion of Tiamat cultists. 

\trystan I

00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,158
blamed Donaar.

\dm Well no, you shouldn't blame Donaar

00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:31,529
you should blame the channel, because

00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:35,370
the channel actually kept her there. 

\ryan Good

00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:37,559
one.

\trystan I'm transferring my anger.

\ryan I blame

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,470
the audience and our fans.

\kris Takes two

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,819
business days.

\dm Just pull the drop down \direct{mimes scrolling through a menu looking for an option}, all

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:48,090
right... _fans_ .

But that's-- we

00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:51,810
learned that very quickly, before a

00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:55,978
battle with cultists, deep in the guts of

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:59,189
an abandoned sort of sepulcher to

00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:01,560
Lathander... I said things about Lathander

00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,769
that Anna Prosser Robinson \marginnote{of the Dice Camera Action podcast} did not

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,019
appreciate, and I want to apologize for

00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:09,209
that right now.

00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:11,310
Sorry about that. It is... becoming a member

00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,479
of the Church of Lathander is not _exactly_, a

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,810
hundred percent like

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,939
joining Scientology. I think that there's...

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,009
some interplay, right?

\kate There are levels.

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,600
\kate You never go full clear.

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,740
\dm Well no, exactly like, but also

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,560
it's like, as soon as you go to

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,360
the Lathander Celebrity Center, you

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,420
know, I mean, you're seeing some parallels.

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,810
\kate And also, Anna Prosser Robinson? \direct{blows a kiss to camera}\

\dm Oh yeah.

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,539
May we. 
\ryan Big fan.
\dm But, so

00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:40,129
that is the situation. Obviously our

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,629
parents are wrapped in there somewhere. So

00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:45,090
when that game ended,

00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:48,269
you were left sort of in this evil

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:53,070
cistern at the base of this cylinder.

00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:59,490
\ryan What of the brothern?
\trystan Boo.

\kate You are _fired_.

00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:04,260
\kris Jerry's like,'The cauldron's full! It filled. Now!'

\dm This

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:08,159
is what's going on: you can see Oak Truestrike

00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:10,620
\trystan Wish I didn't.

who essentiall went through all the

00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,980
proper channels, issued an authentic

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,299
Acquisitions Incorporated job order, to

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,210
help him find Brahma

00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:23,750
Lutier. Halfway through your journeys

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,519
inside this dungeon, you received a

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,740
communique from the Head Office that

00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,169
said that Team Bellerophon had been

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,480
dissolved. So his part of the

00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:35,879
organization, his ability to do anything

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,909
he wants, wherever he wants, under the

00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:42,799
company's auspices, are also gone. And

00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:47,329
indeed there are specific, 700 gold

00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:51,870
rewards, to bring in any member of Team B.

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:55,259
So he is now standing before you. He is

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,720
on the stairs that lead back up to level

00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:01,230
two, and then level one, then obviously

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:05,910
out into the town of Westbridge. That is

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,769
where we set our scene, C-Team. 

\kate Okay.

\dm How

00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:09,449
can I be of assistance? Which portion of

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,929
this world can I simulate for your

00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,800
pleasure?

00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:16,019
\kate \direct{to Trystan} Rosie's looking at you, at Walnut. Cuz

00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:19,259
there's a lot to unpack here.

00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:21,659
And Brahma has vanished. 

\dm Right. If she is

00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,789
here, you cannot find her.
\kate Okay, and \direct{to Trystan} are

00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,990
you in a wolf form still? Were you ever in wolf form? 

00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,969
\trystan No, I

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,870
was. I'll be back as a person now.

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:42,300
\walnut Okay, Rosie...

\dm I was gonna say, please do the transformation.

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:45,120
\kate What's the opposite of _awoo_?

\StageDir{everyone tries saying "awoo" backwards}
\walnut I'm back. 

\kate Rosie's

00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,519
like,

\rosie Are you guys fighting? What's going

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,169
on here.

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,509
\trystan And then okay, um, yeah. Walnut starts

00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:55,919
stammering, exactly like I just did, 

00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:59,189
and then while she's doing that, she's

00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:04,289
looking at K'thriss, hoping that maybe he

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:06,930
gets it. 

\StageDir{Kris clearly does not get it.} 

\kate I don't think K'thriss does.

00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:09,659
K'thriss has never gotten it.

\trystan So she says, she goes,

00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:11,729
\walnut Okay we have a situation, and I'm just

00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:16,110
gonna say it. I'm just gonna say it.
\StageDir{she pauses}

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:17,820
Oak is no longer part of

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,159
Acquisitions Incorporated, and we have to

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,959
bring him in. 
\trystan And then she just looks right

00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:26,458
at Oak.

\kate Rosie looks right at Oak.

00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:29,699
\rosie Sounds good to me.
\oak What are you

00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:33,229
talking about?

\walnut You no longer have a Wild

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:40,320
Card license, and you are to come with us.

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:41,730
\oak Where?

\walnut Uh... I'm in charge of that!

\oak You didn't get there?

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,709
You didn't get to the next part of that?

\walnut I

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,620
don't need a next part, I'm concerned

00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:48,179
with this part.

\kthriss Yeah! 

\rosie Yeah.

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,379
\kate Rosie's prepping a Stunning Strike, just

00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:54,269
in case Oak tries anything.

\trystan Walnut

00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,610
goes,

\walnut I'm gonna take you to our office,

00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:59,819
and I'm gonna do _all_ the paperwork on it.

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:03,180
\trystan And I want to cast Entangle. 

\dm Let's see it.

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,740
You considered Thorn Whip, thought the

00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,159
better of it. 

\trystan Considered Thorn Whip,

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,070
it's a lot. 

\kate It's a low-qual whip.

00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,750
\trystan Okay. \direct{reading from card} "Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,010
ground in a twenty foot square, starting

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,179
from a point within range. For the

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:18,179
duration, these plants turn the ground

00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:20,489
into difficult terrain.

00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:22,469
You must succeed a strength saving throw

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,970
or be restrained 

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,839
until the spell ends."

\dm Exactly, so the

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:30,750
whole area is is like that for everybody.

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,820
yeah I got it, 20-foot radius. 

\dm Okay, just I

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,559
just wanna make sure like you're gonna

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,180
entangle him, and then you're gonna go

00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,489
and try to get him, and you will also be...

00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,099
It's fine.

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,959
\trystan Walnut does not think these things through!
\dm No, I support you 100

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,700
percent yeah I'm about it. Yeah, so

00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:57,750
strength check, and away we go.

00:12:44,700 --> 00:13:03,480
\dm Okay He sidesteps the grasping roots, and

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:05,700
then one especially tenacious pea vine

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,990
begins to wrap up and around his boot,

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:13,170
and he cuts it; he grabs his

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,110
claw-like knife, and slices it out, and he

00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:18,919
says,

\oak I'll go. you don't have to

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,629
force me. 

\walnut You're just gonna come with us?

00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:24,360
What kind of trick is this?

00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:27,659
\oak Well it's like, as convenient as it might be to die in a

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,169
mausoleum, I'd rather not do it today if

00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:33,449
we can get away with it. 

\kthriss Mmm-hmm, you can

00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:35,699
always be put in a mausoleum later. After

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:39,028
death. We don't have to do it here.

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,399
It just is always inbound.

\dm It's exactly

00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:43,169
like his report. I mean like, to a T.

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,000
This is exactly the sort of thing

00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:47,009
he would say.

\donaar He's been nothing but a

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,490
good guy this whole time, see? 

\walnut I don't buy

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:52,129
any of this. 

\dm He's like,

\oak You can cast it

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,870
again.

00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:57,208
\walnut No, it's fine, it did exactly what I

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,190
wanted to do this time. Which is scare

00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:03,078
you into submitting. And I win, and

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,079
everyone saw me win. 

\kthriss Shot across that bow.

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,240
He's like, okay right, 

\rosie Why are you being

00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:11,549
so agreeable? You've been nothing but a

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,159
butthole to us every single time we've

00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:16,828
seen you. 

\oak Arguably, I was mostly a

00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,939
butthole to Walnut.

\rosie You're a butthole

00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:19,979
to Walnut, you're a butthole to all of

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,380
us. Even Donaar.

\oak I don't think that's how

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,180
it works. I think that I think maybe

00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:29,370
\rosie I think I could make a case. I think I pretty much

00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:30,750
know how it works. I know how a lot of things

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,360
work and buttholes is one of them.

\kris I'm like 

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:38,700
a butthole _savant_.

\ryan I got my

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:46,169
my PhD 

\oak I'm gonna go upstairs, and as a

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:47,579
proof of my, you know, _equanimity_ in these

00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:49,589
matters. 

\donaar He's so smart.

00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:53,929
That's a big word, guys.

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:56,700
\oak You will find me waiting by the horse.

00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:59,579
\kate "_Equanimity_". I liked it.

\trystan No, no, you're not

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,110
going not letting him just walk up all

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,080
on his own.

\kate No, of course not.

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:07,470
\donaar I'll escort him.

\dm listen to you you let me

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:10,710
tell you hold on. Both knives go back in

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,720
He says, 

\oak Listen, I just want you one time

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,150
I want you to make up the rules ahead of

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,649
time, and then I can follow them. Because

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,679
what's happening now is you're making up

00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,389
the rules every five minutes, and I have

00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,979
to relearn them. Let's just-- I'll do what

00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:26,100
you want, but I want you to decide what

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,950
that is now. I want you to decide what

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,980
that is now. What could she possibly see

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,460
in you? \direct{gasps all around} 

\rosie All right, that's exactly what I'm

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,590
talking about.

00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,530
That's the butthole I was talking about

\kthriss But it wasn't

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:41,700
to us though.

\donaar Yeah it wasn't. It was tough

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:42,569
but fair.

\walnut Honestly, here's the rules. I'm

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,210
gonna tie you up

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,980
my grandmother's rope. I'm gonna take you

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,080
upstairs. I'm gonna put you in our cart,

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,440
and we're gonna take you to our office

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,570
to a _really good_ office that we have.

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,050
Very good. It's very official. And then

00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:04,680
I'm gonna contact Head Office.

\kate Rosie

00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:06,899
growls for some reason. She's like, okay.

00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,469
\dm He's like, 

\oak No kinky stuff, just like

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,539
the regular, you know. Like don't make

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:16,980
it weird. 

\kate She'll do whatever kinky

00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:18,929
stuff she wants. Back up.

\trystan So she ropes up his

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,740
wrist, and then she looks at that, and she's

00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:24,059
like, Yeah, good job.

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:26,190
\kate To herself?
\trystan and then she goes like this, 

00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,859
and then she wraps that around him. She's goes,

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:32,010
\walnut Good.

\trystan and then also maybe she's not

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,509
really good at knots. so it's just a puzzle

00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,159
\dm It's like you're handfasting him to

00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,539
himself. Yeah yeah, exactly.
\trystan She's kinda

00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,449
like tucking it in itself, and then tying

00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:41,339
a bow. I guess Survival check, maybe? yeah

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:46,470
I love it.

00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:48,090
Oh yeah, these are _so_ bad knots.

\dm It's like, 
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,460
this sort of dress you might see on

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:54,060
today's runways. Yeah I mean, it's just...

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:56,580
well, it's beautiful, but it's loose, and

00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:57,989
drape you know what I mean?

\kate Rosie is like,

00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,120
It'll mess him up.

\dm It looks like he's

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,799
wearing a doily.

\kthriss It's called a Trust Knot.

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,099
\kate Rosie says,

\rosie You did great
\kate, and

00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,928
when Walnut's not looking, she does it better.

00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,188
So ties it nice. 

\dm It's one of these things

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,600
case Brenna would be able to do this.

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,850
Yeah, she like takes the loop, and like...

00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,619
underneath here, and then...

\kate yep yep I'm

00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:16,148
like, this is a really good work, and then

00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,528
I got like a 16.

\trystan You know good

00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:20,648
knots because you're a sailor. You do

00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:23,199
like a bowline knot? Yeah like a sea

00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:25,389
that's some sea stuff.

\dm Yeah yeah I know

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,269
but basically, it's like a couple of

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,710
couple flips of this rope-- have you ever

00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:31,269
seen these-- I talked about

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,159
this, I think when we were in Neverwinter

00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:35,288
before. These old motherfuckers on

00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:37,390
the dock, you can take the rope, and

00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,829
go "whoa!",

\kate and that boat is never gonna

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,230
move. 

\dm Exactly. It's like--
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:42,879
it's like _tuck tuck tuck_, and then all of

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,259
a sudden one big pull in the back, and

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,460
it's a corset. Yeah it's just like fat.

00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:48,278
That's the clue.

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,298
\kate See, that's good roleplaying: pretending

00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:52,528
you don't know about knots when you

00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:56,129
really do. That's the ultimate gamer.

00:17:52,528 --> 00:18:00,788
\dm That's the next level experience that obviously our viewers come to see.

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:02,830
\kate Rosie jabs him

00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,990
in the knot that she made, like

\rosie Get

00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:07,210
walking!

\kthriss Right in the knots.

 I'm not carrying

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,980
retinas screen is nuts thankful cycle

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,690
Okay, you're gonna carry him? Like a sack

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,240
of potatoes, but really gently.

\kate Like your favorite sack of potatoes and then

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:17,169

place; we can't fast travel to the place

Yeah that's true. So why don't you do

00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:45,369

pleased to hear this news.

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:18,720

voice that says that 

\omin You should return

him to the Dran and Courtier, and they will

00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:14,250

00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:28,710
\ryan Wait, but do it in Omin voice.

\dm It's very terse. Very terse, very

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:36,960
businesslike, and having a simple 

\kthriss We're

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,569
going to have to set up the Dran and Courtier like a

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,038
gulag. You can stay in my room

00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:48,359

time I've been watching him. is there

00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:57,679
going to be an incredible guard broke. He

00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,600
hasn't let his eyes drift at all.

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,919
Maybe we should tell Coriander a story

00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:11,459
yeah, and get back to you faster happy -

00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:13,110
I want to hear it um, so Coriander, so as

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,130
soon as you begin to whisper

00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:20,548
to Coriander, the soap bubble shimmer

00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:25,200
starts to form. Nice. it's spin, and then

00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:28,769
add some details. Okay, we have to get

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,250
back quickly, so at top speed, under cover

00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:36,658
of night, we are on our way back to Red

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:39,450
Larch. Oak says some really insulting

00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:42,630
things about copper Dragonborn, and you

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,250
know it gets really angry at him, and

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,640
it's something that they can't

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,769
reconcile. They hate each other

00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,778
really good. Real bad. Back there it's a

00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:54,089
lot. It's a lot, and it's loud, and

00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:56,548
Walnut falls asleep with her head on my

00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:59,878
shoulder for a little while.

00:27:56,548 --> 00:28:02,969
Did we get back what do what do I do I

00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:08,038

yeah I mean yeah

00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:14,669
\rosie K'thriss is is also upset about the mean

00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,368
things that Oak said about copper

00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:18,739
Dragonborn because he and Donaar have

00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:22,829
a special relationship.

00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:29,190
It was very defensive okay his friend.

00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:30,478
\kate I'm gonna make the ship happen. Canonically.

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,499
\kris I'm sitting very close to you when we

00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:34,078
arrived. yeah

00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:38,069
When the bubble I wouldn't a bubble

00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:43,138
around the cart pops, you're only a few

00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:45,479
feet from the carriage house, and

00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:48,138
Coriander is just awaiting direction.

00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:51,629
Okay to get it back in there

00:28:48,138 --> 00:28:56,699
all right reach into my coin

00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:59,189
purse, and she's expensive this season.

00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,369
she's ten coins. Top her

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,070
off.

00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:04,528
yeah yeah yes first top her off yeah

00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:09,958
Exactly. She did good job, so yeah at the

00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:16,729
ten coins. Coriander backs the cart in

00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:19,229
herself. do it it's like some kind of, or

00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:22,048
it's like oh yeah he's a good eye on the

00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:23,399
orb how does you have an orb. You could

00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,628
you could install an orb right there, and

00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:28,618
that would be your that would be your

00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:32,788
ear Revier mmm-hmm all right, so this

00:29:28,618 --> 00:29:34,728
thing is slotted back in here back

00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:38,940
into there. Exactly. We'll call Oak back in here.

00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:40,528
Put him in the fridge yeah exactly

00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,919
I like that idea. I really think the

00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:48,298
holding cell should be fridge. No, he's

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,339
been nothing but amenable, so meaning, so

00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:53,668
he said yeah I go from like revering him

00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:57,538
did not understand yet, so do you... is he

00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:59,609
is it still Well, gently lay him on the

00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:00,898
floor. okay, so good, but you, but I'm

00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:03,509
saying you've carried him in, he's not

00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:05,819
hopping in, or anything like that, so you

00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:08,538
have him over your shoulder as you're

00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:13,739
walking in, and

00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:16,618
Oak says,

\oak Walnut. You better

00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:20,009
hope you find her before I do.

00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:22,978
\dm And as he passes through the doorway of

00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:26,489
the Dran and Courtier...

\walnut Come on. 

\dm ...there is a

00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:29,548
pop, and a slight pressure on the inner

00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:38,940
ear, and as you cross the threshold he is

00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:41,969
completely gone. They're sending a cart

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,558
now. somebody make an Oak. Oh my god, and

00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:47,849
I'm looking around at the patrons, and

00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:49,858
I'm like, who looks like him. oh my god

00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:52,979
but all we need is ashes, and some teeth

00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:54,898
and like that's all I need. It's real

00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:55,950
fast. Leave it to necromancer K'thriss.

00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:58,558
yes

00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:02,129
oh I just met his evidence what he was I

00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:06,019
know it seems weird to me you have son

00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:06,019
yeah You have some experience with this

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:14,459
with this process. yeah with the what do

00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:16,889
you want it was the way that Brahma left,

00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:18,119
that one time, but she didn't

00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:19,228
she disappeared through a portal yeah

00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:21,028
she disappeared through a portal. And we've

00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:22,288
seen it happen with potions too, that

00:31:21,028 --> 00:31:24,028
people drink, and disappear.

00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:25,798
They're just solvents. Wither away. We've

00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:27,838
never seen someone bound, and then

00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,548
Houdini styles finish while they're

00:31:27,838 --> 00:31:32,479
being held. They came across the

00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:32,479
threshold... Oh

00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:38,308
So the B-Team can't exist inside the DnC?

00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:41,128
Somehow they're all dreams! But they used

00:31:38,308 --> 00:31:43,709
to be stationed at the DNC. That's true.

00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:45,418
Yeah that's true you remembered, so much

00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:46,679
I remember DeRozan he runs outside to

00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,528
see if maybe he's just been like,

00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,089
banished back outside the threshold. Is

00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:52,558
he out there? He's not out there. He's

00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:56,308
gone. He's completely gone. He's not pushed

00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:58,878
out. Can I do a Locate Object? Give me an

00:31:56,308 --> 00:32:00,719
object, I can look it hard. I'll then

00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:03,178
describe on name, an object that is

00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:04,649
familiar to you. I can... something on his

00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,249
garb? His knife. What was he wearing?

00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:09,569
you know his codpiece he has confidence

00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:11,690
baby do you count. No, that's not where

00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:14,009
this is going. This is admiration times.

00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,828
Oak is smart, he would remove the codpiece.

00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:19,828
yeah just ditch no he's a step ahead! He

00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:21,099
put her on a cat chasing the Saturn you

00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:24,589
have finite

00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:26,719
like dragon like this sparks all right

00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:28,369
yeah I'll uh yeah I'll thinking to

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,069
describe his knives. His knives are his

00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:33,289
telltale thing. actually if. You are

00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:38,629
not pulling up anything about his knives

00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:40,730
on this plane. hmm what wolf on this

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,880
plane um I do Detect Magic on the

00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,809
threshold. Oh what do you got for me. Oh

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,420
absolutely.

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,500
You have experience with this. You

00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,400
have experienced with this threshold

00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:54,079
your silk I know that is that

00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,860
enchantment, and that enchantment has not

00:32:54,079 --> 00:33:00,319
been altered or removed since you had

00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:02,299
your own experiences. There may be he's

00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,939
always in the end now maybe he's still

00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:06,980
back in there. He's tiny everyone look at

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,180
their feet! Where's the what part is he? I

00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,589
would have Located him then. I would have

00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:15,220
felt him. Yeah, you're right okay.

00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:20,750
unless I was too tiny to feel between my.

00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:23,630
As you come in, Onyx emerges from

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:27,920
underneath a table, and rubs her face on

00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:31,130

00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:35,390

goes, Oh, oh just for a moment.

00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:51,719
She knows that Onyx is a very proud

00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:55,288
creature, and then she gets to heal some

00:35:51,719 --> 00:36:05,518
stuff cuz I say my Healing Word which is...

00:35:55,289 --> 00:36:07,200
Wow. Which is something sure wish I knew.

00:36:05,518 --> 00:36:11,639
What it was they never can know it's

00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:12,778
good enough like Anna healthy ever been

00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:16,230
yeah it's amazing.

00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:17,670
da to the cat ears it becomes like it's

00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,759
like you know it's like it's like it got

00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:28,349
a invincibility star. It's just like all

00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:31,139
rainbows that's a song no, but it's just

00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:31,740
like imbue you, so you you hold it

00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:33,659
in your hand,

00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:36,469
you hold the paw, and then as you

00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:41,879
whisper the word, 

00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:45,480
you can feel three pretty substantial

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,039
pricks in the base of the paw, and you

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,338
can sort of feel them. You can feel them

00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,339
and the

00:36:50,969 --> 00:37:00,509
reassert themselves in proper healthy

00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,509
configuration.

\walnut Hey, how did this happen?

00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:11,969
You know me well yes I do you know that

00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:18,539
I am a proud creature yes you're right

00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:26,519
so it must have been hunting there are

00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:27,700
creatures who are full of boldness

00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:32,889
mm-hmm

00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:41,460
this time of year, and think that a cat

00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:45,429
is not their master. it's just just brown

00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:48,159
whiskers down that's a dangerous time, so

00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:54,098
since I have you here, let me ask you a

00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:55,519
question. Do you remember a man who used

00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:56,940
to work here?

00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:01,659
[Music]

00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:03,940
His name's Oak. yeah that's how I feel.

00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:05,739
That's him. Yep that's the one, no need to

00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,298
tell me. that can't wait I'm Nick yeah

00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:12,670
you fat cat it's freaking out. Shut up,

00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:16,420
I'm doing something, but just like the

00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:22,059
back is arching, and she says

\onyx I am not

00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:23,798
unfamiliar with this creature. Say we

00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:27,028
just tried to bring him here, and he

00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:31,420
disappeared. Has he ever done that before?

00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:33,548
\onyx Well, there was a period of time where he

00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:39,369
dwelt here with us. hmm

00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:43,170
A time I do not enjoy recalling. Who

00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:48,759
would?

\onyx But every one of the groups that

00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:53,909
Propha mothers in this place, the first

00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:56,889
time they enter -- as it was with you -- they

00:38:53,909 --> 00:39:00,079
don't enter completely. They enter one of

00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:06,799
the other worlds. Right.

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:08,329
as we know as is true How do I get to

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,880
that other You know how to get to the

00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:15,699
other worlds?

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,700
Don't you for me there's one world.

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:24,980
well then I'm perplexed, but she crawls

00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:27,410
up like, yeah you ever have a cat to give

00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,860

\trystan No. No animals ever love me,

00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:31,579
Jerry.

00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:36,849
Oh well, it happens. Yes yeah the paws are

00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:40,219
up, and she says,
\onyx Did you have anything

00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:45,469
the first time you came, that you never

00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:50,269
had again?

\walnut Yes, I did. An acorn, a gold-capped

00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:54,439
acorn.

\onyx Not delicious. Not delicious.

00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:57,949
I agree with you. hmm

00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,380
kinda extra points yeah lousy problem

00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:02,750
maybe no, so at this point I'll say I'm

00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,640
Leslie. Thank you. I hope you're feeling

00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,750
better.

00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:08,299
If there's ever anything else I can do,

00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:13,730
right upstairs. Good various

00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:19,400
like take to it yeah 

\walnut I'm just gonna melt

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:21,800
back into the ground in the inner.

\kris In the

00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,579
meantime, I'm talking to you \direct{indicating Donaar}, and I'm

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:28,760
saying,

\kthriss Did you know he was gonna do that?

00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:29,690
Did he... did you help him do that? cuz if

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,200
you didn't vanish

00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:36,099
ya know was awesome though yeah I mean

00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:39,769
because if you didn't, then we got

00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:42,589
terrible advice from the Head Office,

00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:44,960
in terms of what to do with him. Don't

00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,340
tell us to do that. It's probably the

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,789
worst place we could have taken them.

00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:51,260
What's here that's known um I had to

00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,949
know if that was what's gonna happen.

00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,680
That's true.

00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:56,359
Can you talk to I'm gonna get her is

00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:59,569
your size I had to take a break

00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:04,430
yeah that cuz it's blown, but because I

00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:06,350
don't bother him right? The Secretarian?

00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:08,539
yeah yeah go for it. I'm gonna pull out

00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:12,139
the ledger at this point. 

00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:13,489
Level Two ledger document believe

00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:16,009
should have it. We should have it with us

00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:18,439
here just while we do the show, but it

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:21,230
was it would be okay what's on this way

00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,320
back to my truck, but it would be totally

00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,690
okay if you wanted to have the documents.

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,350
In seven years, we just wear costumes

00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:32,750
every week. this will just be right to

00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:35,179
the on the missed that the that had

00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:41,360
been said before. yeah like we're turning

00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:45,589
on it, and say you know like went Walnut

00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:48,289
from obviously very official all of the

00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:52,039
steps a yep, and then upon entering

00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:55,179
Dran and Courtier office, Oak Truestrike 

00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:59,779
disappeared with a popping noise.

00:41:55,179 --> 00:42:03,039
threatened us was it butthole was like

00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,360
That butthole is still at large.

00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,670
nobody the decoration me like if you're

00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,789
like was a butthole, was not a butthole

00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:13,670
and it's like you see a check big check

00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:17,179
butthole at large. I like going back to

00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:25,269
the idea that Walnut right right, so it's

00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:31,399
like just an asterisk yeah yeah, So

00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:34,039
even like halfway through your your

00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:37,010
missive, you start to hear scratching on

00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:42,500
the next page. Okay. I turn it. So you

00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:50,360
flip it up, and it says, Why did you not

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:52,940
search your prisoner - Secretarian.

00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:56,059
then what you say is. What were they

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:58,119
saying? You know, um, they just want

00:42:56,059 --> 00:43:03,829
confirmation of our location right now.

00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:12,980
and then Walnut writes our decision

00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:14,719
assuming like put that on me well

00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,719
risking him for 24 hours.

00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:21,439
First of all, wasn't _my_ prisoner. Your

00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:24,279
prisoner is my friend. I don't frisk my

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,539
friend. Did Donaar maybe notice

00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,640
something that would have known his

00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:31,570
person? Is that a roll that can be made? I

00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:34,359
yeah an acorn some acorn in your pocket

00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:38,260
yeah may not have been in his pocket

00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:40,120
yeah a desperate man I don't just had

00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,720
people cut I mean you were he was all up

00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,000
on you

00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:47,619
maybe yours own it's like the Princess

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,710
and the Pea. yeah yeah yeah trying to

00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:53,679
make it, so Donaar could be helpful, but

00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:56,320
retroactively, so yeah, so I write our

00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,089
decision to shortcomings, and then while

00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:02,320
I'm waiting for a reply, is there a point

00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:04,539
and snores remember the reply, so you

00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,500
flip it over. Write your note, flip it

00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:14,170
over, and then after a pause, it says that

00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:20,289
most likely Oak Truestrike had a portkey

00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:24,030
to access the Test Market. So I slam

00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:24,029
it shut, and I say, Here's what we know:

00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,530
remember those acorns that we had when we

00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,809
first got here and how they took us to

00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:34,390
the other versions of the inn? Yeah It

00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:36,880
seems that Oak had one of those on his

00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:40,420
person, and he is now in a place that we

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,369
can't get to without these tokens. Well

00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,430
is he gonna be stuck there, cuz that's

00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:47,199
fine. Yeah, how did we get out? Is he gonna

00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:49,029
show up in here? Yeah, that's the thing.

00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,369
You've got two things we can do: we can

00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:52,810
either find one and go after him, or wait

00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:54,309
cuz he's gonna pop up in the inn. That's

00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:56,409
what we did only got another Test Market.

00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:57,009
yeah that's a great idea. Donaar, that's a

00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:59,710
great idea!

00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,630
That's true I guess. Yeah you just chill

00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:04,900
out, but Oak is a sneaky bastard.

00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:07,300
So where did we pop out, and then in our

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,980
West you know okay in the middle round

00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,990
If we know exactly where, then what we

00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,829
could do is go to that room that was his,

00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:17,679
and just put like some blades where his

00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:19,690
hamstrings are gonna show up. I'm just

00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,659
ladies last them oh my god I think

00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:25,450
that's a really, and I'm gonna go low

00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:27,460
blood just to try just try, and then

00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:30,460
we'll have them an assault. It's all good.

00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:33,639

Brahma and Oak, and the the mausoleum of

00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:32,880
Lathander, and the statue. And she looks

00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:32,879

00:48:34,768 --> 00:48:44,199
this Darkmagic boy never... I never really

understood it.

00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:50,528
yeah he's kind of a it's kind of a

00:48:47,018 --> 00:48:53,798
birdbrain. yeah I was told that he had

00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:55,809
removed it because something happened to

00:48:53,798 --> 00:49:00,699
it once. what

00:48:55,809 --> 00:49:04,028
Well, people-- I was assured that they were

00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:07,000
_eventually_ rescued, but people would go

00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:11,190
in, and then not return. What kind of

00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,719
people? Like a lot of people? Trainees. oh

00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:16,240
yeah yeah it's kind of have you been in

00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:17,139
there? Omin told me that he went in

00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,318
right away

00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:23,048
oh, and was able to get them back out. I

00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,548
see. Well, okay, have you have you been

00:49:23,048 --> 00:49:27,369
through it yourself?

00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:29,588
Have you ever tried it? No no, I'm I am

00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:32,200
told that I am never to cross the

00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:34,568
threshold while having an acorn capped in

00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,489
gold, and I felt like that was a

00:49:34,568 --> 00:49:38,558
reasonable restriction, because that's

00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:41,858
not something I customarily have. It's

00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,660
oddly specific. So we've been through it--

00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:46,239
that's like the trial they've to to

00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:49,000
become a part of the enterprise, and

00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,969
there were some folks last time we were

00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,889
there that had not come out, but also

00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:55,750
didn't seem like they _wanted_ to. They

00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:57,009
seemed pretty chill. Good for them.

00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,960
Yeah, I mean they're living their best

00:49:57,009 --> 00:50:01,599
life. Yeah, they made the best

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,800
of a bad situation. Yeah I'd

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,150
like to meet these easy.

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,820
Oh um, the trial isn't fun.

00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:14,230
I wouldn't recommend voluntarily

00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:18,370
entering it, and you know it's a dark

00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:20,710
it's-- it's a mess in there. Carnivores, I

00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:24,839
don't know how you feel about rodents-- a

00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:24,840
lot of those. They're in a better place

00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:32,040
though you don't have to cross the

00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:35,619
threshold, but we could certainly get you

00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:37,599
these nuts where do you have do you know

00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:40,119
where they keep them? well yeah that's one of

00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,130
the roasted nuts, or one of the people

00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,380
come here for that right? Well, I don't

00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,090
know if it's just _any_ nut though. Well

00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:49,720
you have gold, and she sucky she's like

00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:53,140
it's not it's done, but let  help

00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:55,750
you, so all right she she goes over next

00:50:53,139 --> 00:50:57,400
to the stove, and she opens a bin. It has

00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:59,949
almost like a brass

00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:03,599
handle on it, and she pulls it down, and

00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:07,179
then looking with her into it. It is

00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:10,690
absolutely empty okay, and then in the

00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:14,319
base of it you can see a little daylight,

00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:18,820
peeking through inside the bin where the

00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:26,440
outside is. Okay She looks in close, and

00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:28,660
she says,

\propha Damn it, yeah that's damn it

00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,269
she's like, I needed ID he doesn't see

00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:32,829
what happened on the outside oh oh. So

00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:35,559
she just lets it go, and the entire

00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:38,460
mechanism just slams up. okay, and then

00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:41,889
she goes it she looks over her mall,

00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,990
thinks better of it, and then walks out

00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:49,750
the front door. okay

00:51:43,989 --> 00:51:52,209
scowls at some ragged-looking hops from

00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:54,900
last year that are still on the trellis, 

00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:57,190
she hasn't cleared them away yet.

00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,289
exactly right She goes around the side

00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:06,150
and looks in, and you can see very

00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:10,900
plainly scraped, scrabbled, chewed an

00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:13,990
access point from outside has been

00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:16,599
almost surgically established by what

00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:17,619
looks like animal. That's

00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:19,059
sufficient I mean there's a lot of

00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:26,949
scraping, and what you'd think would be

00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:29,409
teeth okay orange okay be a minutes it's

00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:30,849
helpful, but oh the whole what about the

00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:32,920
bite and scratch marks, do they look like

00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:35,710
they came from a large animal no no no

00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,570
okay okay, so we got like a squirrel

00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:40,690
infestation problem going on. hey I

00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:42,370
listen I just I just give you the amount

00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:45,429
hurt, and cancel I just give you the

00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:48,579
information. okay you know I don't

00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:52,599
oh I don't know to do with it. I'm a

00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:56,710
passive, you know, agent in this. Is this

00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,909
Jerry, or father? Well, what's the

00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:01,300
difference really? inter

00:52:57,909 --> 00:53:03,069
okay, so you've this is the where

00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,350
the bin where you keep your nuts.

00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:08,410
Looks like somebody's gotten in, and

00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:10,929
eaten all your nuts. the hunt She looks

00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:17,889
back at you just [like], is that is that the

00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:20,669
case? yes Rosie okay alright well she

00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:24,759
reads there's there's a bin around the

00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:27,970
edge underneath an eave, full of

00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,160
firewood, and she gets a few pieces, snaps

00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:33,339
them up, and then basically just tries to

00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:37,239
stuff the hole with the wood. Okay oh

00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:41,550
can I do a I'll just try a Survival

00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:45,369
check. mother test yeah you win

00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:48,280
local squirrel nope that's the

00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:51,069
point it's a Florida squirrel. That's no

00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,290
good okay, so Rosie's kind of helpless

00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:55,000
here. This is not her forte,

00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:58,329
but she does know someone who's pretty

00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,480
good up in the wilderness. so well right

00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:04,449
here the boys doing while I'm up

00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:07,329
giggling yeah you might be giggling nice.

00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:11,049
I'm serious as a heart attack in that in

00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:14,199
a room, and I'm like I'm upset, and to the

00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:15,370
two of you, I say, were you doing

00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,649
there we don't want to split the party

00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:21,579
when he shows up disrobe, and return Plan

00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:24,039
A is on. Before dawn, we have to be ready

00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:26,880
for him. He might know the Test Market

00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:30,190
better than us. That's true.

00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:34,720
Almost certainly does. when you hear that

00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:37,568
long just keeps going nope nope no no no

00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:40,629
no no no no She's get a little no song.

00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:44,230
yeah okay voice, you stay out there and

00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:50,009
wait for Oak. well not deer could you

00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:54,699
come down outside, meet me out here? yes

00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:59,409
She charges downstairs, goes outside, yes

00:54:54,699 --> 00:55:02,469
check this out, so as you as you go to

00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:06,038
the front door and open it, Prophetess

00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:10,449
like saying realistic, and then she holds

00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:15,490
the door one goes okay all right Her

00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:20,288
face is hard. oh, so sorry for

00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:23,048
your loss yes, so you can see

00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:28,539
she passes you, and sort of takes up an

00:55:23,048 --> 00:55:30,818
angry position behind the bar, and around

00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:33,670
the corner you see Rosie Beestinger, who is

00:55:30,818 --> 00:55:37,230
not your grandma's grandma -- not in

00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:39,250
this season -- 

\kate yeah I'm inspecting like

00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:41,949
trying to do this like detective work

00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:43,420
yeah CSI red alert you yeah CSI red

00:55:41,949 --> 00:55:45,009
large put up clearly I'm not even

00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:50,079
looking in the right place. I'm like I

00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:51,639
picked up a leaf, and I'm like yeah, yeah

00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,200
I'm it holding up to the sun, I'm checking

00:55:51,639 --> 00:56:01,048
the keep a shadow that it casts, and I'm

00:55:53,199 --> 00:56:04,358
like no some trials yeah exactly

00:56:01,048 --> 00:56:06,849
I come up and I see that there's a hole

00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:08,768
on the side of the thing. right look at

00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:09,759
the scratch marks, and I go, Oh,

00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:13,689
interesting

00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:17,679
you take oh six to survive yeah, and I

00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:19,929
say oh looks like we got a problem

00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:21,969
wait you think got a squirrel's, we got a

00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:29,739
squirrel problem? Not even that anyways

00:56:21,969 --> 00:56:31,959
North oh no no no it's like a it's like

00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:36,250
a displace your squirrels notes I know

00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:38,679
it's a large words red squirrel oh, but

00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:41,079
the larger risk oh, so you can see the

00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:42,940
the claw, and the tooth; this all makes

00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:44,310
sense, but there are other types of

00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:48,519
scrapes

00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:52,480
around this sort of portal they've made

00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:54,369
into the Nut Dimension. Why I live there

00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,550
that's not a real eye. I should not have

00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:59,858
dammit it's not I should not have said

00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,750
that. I don't want to confuse it, but

00:56:59,858 --> 00:57:03,809
that is it, but there is another type of

00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:06,789
there is another scraper that 
00:57:03,809 --> 00:57:09,909
that is not made by a squirrel

00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:12,849
Oh, _bored_?

00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:15,219
It's like _bored_ out it's not animal. oh I

00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:18,039
see, so there's some there's something

00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:19,779
that looks like maybe a human agent also

00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:22,449
made this hole. Sure, or some kind of

00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:25,480
robo-squirrel. Oh

00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:26,829
robo-squirrel Nice. did you have for

00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,269
Summon Squirrels as a forest friends

00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:34,769
thing? oh yeah I'm wondering if squirrels

00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:34,769
the consequences of our Forest Friends

00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:42,309
yeah I think you killed most of it was

00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:45,130
squirrels at one point yeah sure

00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:49,920
definitely birdies, but yeah, but there's

00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:53,410
tracks yell, or sure it wouldn't be weird

00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:56,139
exactly it wouldn't be weird to see them

00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:58,929
obviously in town. like this town is out

00:57:56,139 --> 00:58:01,000
and there's trees. Exactly, but by the

00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:06,250
same token, this is an especially well-traveled

00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:10,829
squirrel highway. I better turn

00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:13,599
the great scroll I look at this, and I go

00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:15,130
\walnut Well, we have a squirrel problem, but more

00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,970
importantly we have an Oak problem. What

00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:21,460
are we doing out here?

00:58:15,969 --> 00:58:22,019
oh I explained now here it

00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:25,329
comes.

00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:27,489
Propha thought we could make one an

00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:30,460
acorn dipped in gold and travel to the

00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:32,049
Oak dimension ourselves, so we came to

00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,530
check out the nuts. The nuts were gone

00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:37,839
that's a we've got a sort of a Yak \marginnote{what's this?}

00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:44,040
Shaving situation happening. Okay Yak

00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:49,269
Shaving Day. It's a deep cut. What if we

00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:51,869
what if we get all together, and we just

00:58:49,269 --> 00:58:55,630
asked the squirrels to come back, and

00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:56,950
give us the nuts? Yeah, we could do that,

00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,400
or we could just go keep waiting for

00:58:56,949 --> 00:59:00,309
Oak.

00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,250
yes this is a dumb idea. yeah no I really

00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:06,070
like the squirrel idea, Rosie. I like it a

00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:10,559
Lot better than being in that room. They

00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:14,559
are 100% naked. I know, and I'm missing it!

00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,929
Not much to miss. What are you doing? I

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,739
mean you realize at this point, I have to

00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:24,730
guard Donaar I'm teaching you Boulder

00:59:20,739 --> 00:59:27,609
Knife Parchment Tail. Boulder beats Knife,

00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:29,889
Knife beats Parchment, Parchment beats

00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:34,750
Boulder, Tail beats everything. yes oh

00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:38,799
yeah I've never Tailed you said, and you

00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:41,710
keep losing. the guy he doesn't count as

00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,090
a tail. it's not fair for one, because I

00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:46,000
don't know what he is. You could be a

00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:51,910
tail of a larger being. We keep going in

00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:55,360
circles about this. By right of, you

00:59:51,909 --> 01:00:11,980
know, the transitive property is not in

00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:14,680
this room. We think we can make our own

01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:18,730
Portkeys if we just get some acorns. Do

want to keep playing your children's

01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:25,869
game? How quickly do you think we can

01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:28,059
do it because I think that's a better

01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:30,639
plan, but I'm worried that we're gonna

01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:32,110
just miss him. Maybe we have somebody

01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:33,460

by himself. Either way, he will be in this

01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:10,088
room. I was talking about squirrels a lot

01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:12,429

the squirrels to come here, and hopefully

01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:28,990
they're gonna bring a nut with them, and

01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:31,929
it's gonna be everybody's responsibility

01:02:28,989 --> 01:02:34,989
to grab their own squirrel, and get their

01:02:31,929 --> 01:02:37,449
own nut. If Dad killed a squirrel. If there's

01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:45,269
one thing I know, it's that I can get a

01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:45,269
nut. Oh, this laughter is in character.

01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:51,278
Okay, everyone's gonna grab a squirrel.

01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:55,269

01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:56,528
get this with getting his squirrel. when

01:02:55,269 --> 01:03:01,630

01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:58,679
yeah I'm in my mind I've just I,

01:10:56,729 --> 01:11:01,288
in the manner of those, you know

01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:12,179
those trash pickup spears,

01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:14,248
I've just stabbed through through a pile

01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:16,199
of dead squirrels around you. just it's

01:11:14,248 --> 01:11:17,670
not it's not working like they're a

01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:20,908
little bit quick I can't make out the

01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:23,489
you know the cheek situation, so feel

01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:23,759
like everything yeah okay I try one more

01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:27,209
thing

01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:29,610
maybe let me let me see if let me go see

01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:32,130
if he's getting anything on his rod here

01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:35,339
yeah yeah let me make it a let me give

01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:36,269
that an attempt yeah yeah I mean it

01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,980
could be you, but you're actually like

01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:38,670
legit trying to it tackle you do you

01:11:37,979 --> 01:11:41,819
think my advantage

01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:43,408
okay yeah yeah well we'll figure out the

01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:44,488
other screens later, but, but yes yeah, but

01:11:43,408 --> 01:11:46,319
a missing your if you're trying to do

01:11:44,488 --> 01:11:48,959
real attack this is this is ineffective

01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:53,308
though I realize how absurd this is yeah

01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:55,170
so I whispers I just titanate all

01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:59,020
of them while I was considering that's

01:11:55,170 --> 01:12:03,100
an tacular you know if you want to sift

01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:03,100
[Laughter]

01:12:03,889 --> 01:12:09,440
it's how, but it's luck we got a more

01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:12,500
secluded area I would have done I'm

01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:15,469
going to I'm going to return Ligotti

01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:17,779
to his serpent form, and won't have him

01:12:15,469 --> 01:12:22,010
hunt I'm gonna instruct him,

\kthriss You

01:12:17,779 --> 01:12:25,488
seek that acorn scent, and get

01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:31,400
more than one if you can, just so we have

01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:33,888
them. yeah yeah what would kind of rule

01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:36,469
would that be. sure Exactly, so

01:12:33,889 --> 01:12:39,639
basically you take him, you communicate

01:12:36,469 --> 01:12:43,969
this to him, and then basically you just

01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:45,770
throw him into this squirrel ocean. well

01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:47,719
I was gonna say I'm like don't let me

01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:50,840
throw it I'm not gonna throw it because

01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:52,760
I know that a snake object, it's just

01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:55,429
there's got scattered oh yeah I'm gonna

01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:58,610
put him in the in the grass nearby. He

01:12:55,429 --> 01:13:01,399
can choose the path the talk did you set

01:12:58,609 --> 01:13:02,750
him yeah let's just go set him down. yeah

01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:05,059
I don't need to do this part for him.

01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:08,149
yeah he's quite capable well he's P's a

01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:12,230
big boy. yeah, and him if I'd you know

01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:14,089
exam they are of course, so micromanage

01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:16,789
yes see, so you sort of like you like go

01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:20,329
into the alley looking out you could

01:13:16,789 --> 01:13:22,760
pack sit down yeah walk out nonchalant

01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:25,850
go go child nobody has to know

01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:29,210
right, and then immediately it's like a

01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:34,969
sheepdog like he comes out, and he's just

01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:36,920
shaping this firm ass skittling you can

01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:40,850
hear his you can hear his sort of

01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:43,609
jeweled belly on the cobble as he's he's

01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:45,289
going through, it's just squeaking, and

01:13:43,609 --> 01:13:48,109
then let's see how many of these

01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:50,750
he comes away with scoop

01:13:48,109 --> 01:13:53,329
them up just a gentle hold he comes away

01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:58,010
with one now should we see what kind of

01:13:53,329 --> 01:14:07,189
nut it is no we should literally I made

01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:09,650
a nut table this is like yeah, but you

01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:12,589
see that that plump I mean it's just

01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:14,839
limp right you don't think it's dead, but

01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:17,060
you think that it has decided 
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:21,680
that not moving is the right play. yeah

01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:24,130
You'll squeeze five pine nuts those are

01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,130
expensive

01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:31,130
exactly right you sit around, and spit

01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:33,500
back out there, so, so Ligotti's last

01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:36,619
attempt has scattered these squirrels

01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:38,060
hither and yon. You have an acorn, and you

01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:41,390
have gold you think that you could make

01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:48,200
one portkey. Can I get some perception

01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:51,850
rolls from you and from Rosie? oh god

01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:55,970
damn how you like a 20? I do like a 20.

01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:57,950
you look at 20, so you can see at the

01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:59,659
base of a tree, so the rest of these

01:14:57,949 --> 01:15:03,109
Scrolls have been cut they've actually

01:14:59,659 --> 01:15:05,479
it's sort of like filtered back out into

01:15:03,109 --> 01:15:08,000
the natural world that you summoned them

01:15:05,479 --> 01:15:10,159
from, but you can see that a couple

01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,119
squirrels slightly different coloration

01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:15,069
hmm

01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:19,960
have are engaged with one another,

01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:23,090
chattering at the base of this tree. oh I

01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:31,220
want to go I want to go run up on them

01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:36,069
okay like instantly right, so you see you

01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:40,490
can see one of them from his mouth

01:15:36,069 --> 01:15:49,429
produce an acorn, and you can see another

01:15:40,489 --> 01:15:53,210
one produce five almonds, and they make

01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:57,730
the exchange very quickly, and then huh

01:15:53,210 --> 01:16:07,670
start to hop away. I know right now I

01:15:57,729 --> 01:16:11,750
know we are trading I go we need other

01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:13,310
nuts oh do you want to go after the one

01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:15,260
with the acorn, and I'll go after the one

01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:17,840
that has the yeah almonds? it's like a

01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,710
it's like a it's like a county fair. yeah

01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,630
I love it

01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:22,130
There's a lot of pigs, a lot of grease.

01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:26,090
okay I want to try, and grab that one

01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:27,789
with the the nut just yeah what I just

01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:30,360
try to grab it. I'm going to use my

01:16:27,789 --> 01:16:32,039
anyway your skills you an advantage

01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:35,069
give it a skill that would give you a

01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:35,639
better a good plus. slide it here it

01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:37,229
wouldn't be hard.

01:16:35,639 --> 01:16:38,850
I think Sleight of Hand is probably a

01:16:37,229 --> 01:16:41,158
pretty good force Brooke for

01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:43,650
squirrel-cage AG you have a bag that's

01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:48,960
slightly like the same size as an acorn

01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:51,599
ya have a lot of dirt, and it's roughly

01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,100
the same. Are we right outside, like we

01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,389
didn't go that far, right? yeah I just

01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,100
want to kind of go back in, and give a

01:16:54,389 --> 01:17:00,779
little heads up to it be like okay, so

01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:02,340
comes back in that room yeah that's very

01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:04,800
good, so you're able to you're able to

01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:07,319
catch just the end of his tail yes

01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,400
it's just be just like the whole front

01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:11,689
of its like this trying to get that

01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:14,969
purchase, and he just got it like this

01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:17,069
oh that's a fair question

01:17:14,969 --> 01:17:22,100
no oh my god it's like a wringing out a

01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:26,399
towel. I know I take the nut, and then I

01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:30,539
he's just like no I know, but then I give

01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:43,408
him three of my Goodberries. I'll put my

01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:46,170
his misery lose like, what is it, 95% of

01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:48,179
the nuts that they bury? Oh yeah like

01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:49,199
they don't know right? So anyway, I give

01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:52,319
him the Goodberries, and then I'm like

01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:53,750
Ted on your way no you got my not nice

01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,670
got your nuts.

01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:58,050
Rosie is chasing after the one with the

01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:59,690
almonds because she figures even if we

01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:02,730
can't get an acorn, maybe we can trade

01:17:59,689 --> 01:18:08,039
with these almonds. mm-hmm, and I'm going

01:18:02,729 --> 01:18:09,750
to do I as I'm running, Sebastian pops

01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:13,859
his head oh yeah yeah, and he whispers

01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:16,979
Intimidation, and I think yeah you got

01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:19,948
this one, and then I run in front of this

01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:24,809
squirrel, I cut him off, and I squat, and I

01:18:19,948 --> 01:18:26,460
say Google's nothing I'm gonna do this

01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:27,780
with advantage oh that's pretty good

01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:31,260
don't need it

01:18:27,779 --> 01:18:32,939
no I didn't okay, so that's a 23 okay, and

01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:35,100
also if he wants to out an acorn

01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:37,138
cuz he's, so scared yeah well that's what

01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:40,300

01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:45,460
yeah exotic I know

01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:47,230
pop noise yeah it's a spice weasel, so no

01:18:55,658 --> 01:19:06,729
business change the squirrel exchange

01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:09,158
here can I get a perception check it's

01:19:06,729 --> 01:19:11,379
not great. it's a four okay I perceive

01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:14,319
nothing did Auspicia do any squirrel

01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:23,770
checks to get her nut? no no she's she's

01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:25,899
watching the door yeah verify that okay

01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:29,230
I have my five little elements, and I'm

01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:31,629
waiting for a squirrel oh you're right

01:19:29,229 --> 01:19:33,279

01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:05,960
between the seasons, where many creatures

01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:07,750
like that are already are just waking up

01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:40,988
boy

01:20:39,099 --> 01:20:43,510
make me see whatever you're the

01:20:40,988 --> 01:20:44,039
perceptive one I can't be great at

01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:46,210
everything

01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:49,599
okay, so we're a we got two of them.

01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:52,059
You're looking good. yeah I'm fine. Have

01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:53,350
yeah I got my nut it's like this side

01:20:52,059 --> 01:20:59,640
over here

01:20:53,350 --> 01:21:03,130
I got mean that, so come back to LA okay

01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:06,600
okay well what should we do we need nut

01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:06,600
for the first time I feel like an idiot

01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:15,010
surrounded by dead yes there's gotta be

01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:17,470
a better way to do this. This is the

01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:20,579
general store open sitting on, so much

01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:24,340
gold she has to own that horse.

01:21:20,579 --> 01:21:26,529
I was like burned Locate Object I can

01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:27,819
look, is there disturbed ground? Could I

01:21:26,529 --> 01:21:29,619
do like a Survival check to look for a

01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:31,809
disturb you can you can only newly

01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:35,609
buried you can do all princess yeah just

01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:38,830
we just go the grocery store has an 18

01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:42,039
here's an 18 it's an 18 is an 11 plus 7

01:21:38,829 --> 01:21:45,369
or my Survival. I sure, so you are you are

01:21:42,039 --> 01:21:48,130
down, looking for, you know, for lack of a

01:21:45,369 --> 01:21:52,840
better term, _squirrel sign_. mm-hmm

01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:55,060
and you can see what you

01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:58,210
think might have been caches. mm-hm

01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:59,710
but they're freshly dug, like they're

01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:02,170
they're dug up. I've done your hand

01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:05,380
through the soft soil, and you might find

01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:07,930
a cab, but you don't find any true nuts,

01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:12,369
and in fact you think that the traffic

01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:16,390
is such in town, and through these areas

01:22:12,369 --> 01:22:19,420
it's dense as it was over around the

01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:20,800
side of the Dran and Courtier, and you

01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:23,500
think that you might be able to follow

01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,750
this. oh okay you might actually be able

01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:28,899
to follow this path. It's

01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:31,239
substantially Trung yeah okay, so I look

01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:33,219
at Algy you guys I go I go I think they

01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:36,189
went this this way I think this is the

01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:38,980
way that they go. Follow me to the nut

01:22:36,189 --> 01:22:42,609
trading place. huh nice I got my almonds

01:22:38,979 --> 01:22:44,019
I'm coming up. yeah I see if I ever think

01:22:42,609 --> 01:22:49,689
that they might like well you got those

01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:57,940
five pine nuts immediately I was before

01:22:49,689 --> 01:22:59,139
I knew more grain nice oats around, so we

01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:01,599
follow yes exactly

01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:04,780
So you're following it, and it is

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,980
a circuitous it's like the it's like the

01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:07,599
sort of

01:23:05,979 --> 01:23:09,689
sometimes I wiggle my foot when I'm

01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:14,010
talking I was hoping that was the puppy

01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:17,469
know, so in it's almost like it doesn't

01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:20,110
it's like spycraft, or something okay

01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:23,039
where it's like this is this is like the

01:23:20,109 --> 01:23:26,799
path that's sort of like circuitous,

01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:30,699
tortured path you would try to enunciate

01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:32,380
if you were trying to hide, and you

01:23:30,699 --> 01:23:35,800
thought that you were really smart, and

01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:38,909
you were a squirrel. sure it's like,

01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:41,470
straight, little loop, yes straight it's

01:23:38,909 --> 01:23:45,069
like around the tree, and then keeps

01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:50,590
going the same way yes, so you can, so you

01:23:45,069 --> 01:23:54,939
can follow this path, and then this is

01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:58,329
sort of in a cop's sort of past the

01:23:54,939 --> 01:24:03,509
Northeast, so as we know the drunk

01:23:58,329 --> 01:24:07,449
warrior dnc sort of around that central

01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:09,480
circle of red larch living it's sort of

01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:14,559
down in the southeast portion of it, so

01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:15,939
copse just on the outside of town to the

01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,000
northeast, very near to the lighthouse

01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:23,799
okay that Rosie founded to take care of

01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:28,479
fall apples, but out in this, but you can

01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:30,880
see that there is a not a full clearing,

01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:33,639
but definitely the impression that you

01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:39,130
would get was that these trees were

01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:44,260
paying a tree homage mmm in the center

01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:46,180
of this path. What you think

01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:49,449
that it be you think that it's not

01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:52,000
something you would recognize if you

01:24:49,449 --> 01:24:53,079
weren't a Druid. I think like you

01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,329
might notice that it was sort of a

01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:57,519
separate thing, but the idea that it

01:24:55,329 --> 01:24:59,819
exists in a continuum with all these are

01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:03,160
living things that's it that's a Walnut

01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:07,689
observation what kind of tree is it that

01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:09,760
particular tree is an Oak tree, but yeah

01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:11,710
our problems may be solved should

01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,610
anything still be on it because we all

01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:16,899
know oak trees make acorns. learn that

01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:19,019
from a puzzle room is just getting into

01:25:16,899 --> 01:25:19,019
it

01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:25,150
so one that goes ah ha this one this it

01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:27,698
is a certain type of tree name I will

01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:32,348
not speak, but it will lead us into that

01:25:27,698 --> 01:25:34,479
other guy who I hate my walls do we see

01:25:32,349 --> 01:25:40,269
any are there any other ending that's

01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:47,279
not a one, but what you do notice is that

01:25:40,269 --> 01:25:49,809
high up, perhaps 20 feet up, no visible

01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:53,488
branches around that tear of the tree

01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:57,429
you think that you can see an entrance

01:25:53,488 --> 01:26:03,218
into a tree into a tree squirrel's nice

01:25:57,429 --> 01:26:06,099
interesting no it's not human sight

01:26:03,219 --> 01:26:10,868
that's too much. Now at that precise

01:26:06,099 --> 01:26:14,139
moment, I will pause the universe, so that

01:26:10,868 --> 01:26:15,639
we can do our commercial break. Thank you

01:26:14,139 --> 01:26:17,319
so much for coming back and hanging out

01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:19,659
with us here at the C-Team. We will be

01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:25,738
back momentarily, after we go to the

01:26:19,658 --> 01:26:31,529
bathroom. We return now to Episode 2 of

01:26:25,738 --> 01:26:36,299
Teh C-Teams, entitled Plans Within Plans.

01:26:31,529 --> 01:26:36,300
Wow, I like it.

01:26:36,729 --> 01:26:40,229
yes master

01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:48,368
[Laughter]

01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:49,149
nothing When last we saw our heroes,

01:26:48,368 --> 01:26:53,518
nothing honey

01:26:49,149 --> 01:26:58,138
they were at the base of a oak tree,

01:26:53,519 --> 01:27:03,940
completely stripped of its tender fruits,

01:26:58,139 --> 01:27:08,650
and there was a an aperture high up in

01:27:03,939 --> 01:27:11,710
this tree that was noticed just before

01:27:08,649 --> 01:27:16,448
we left for commercial break. Now, I'm not

01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:19,989
saying that it's an important hole, you

01:27:16,448 --> 01:27:22,029
know. alright yeah yeah I'm just saying

01:27:19,988 --> 01:27:23,169
there's a hole like I don't know what

01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:25,359
He's right, we should just go home

01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:28,559
Let's go back to that, why not a long

01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:28,558
rest? Why not one rather

01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:35,410
I'm the closest one to be in squirrel

01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:38,199
sized say well we got a Ligotti, and we

01:27:35,409 --> 01:27:42,960
got a bluesy sense John, and that's a

01:27:38,199 --> 01:27:42,960
bastion, and I can you know I believe

01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:50,890
that's true look I in Louisiana the best

01:27:46,569 --> 01:27:53,559
races it's true, and, but I mean a

01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:55,360
squirrel would be afraid of Ligotti

01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:58,600
certainly, but would they be afraid of a

01:27:55,359 --> 01:28:02,319
weasel? Only one way to find out. well

01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:05,800
Wildshape is this shape I mean it's a

01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,909
cool it's a cool shape yeah okay I hear

01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,850
you have to be a weasel.

01:28:06,909 --> 01:28:11,920
It's worth a try that's why yeah I don't

01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:17,380
know let's try it Oh, weasels are really

01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:19,630
good squirrels yeah being sighs you're

01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:22,090
not wrong as their natural enemy

01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:24,880
their only natural enemy no it's fine

01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:27,270
no easily diseased weasel like you have

01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,619
squirrel, and weasel's basically Satan

01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:31,810
well then maybe I'll drop all is not

01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:36,090
yeah all right, so I'm in a wild shape

01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:38,310
into a weasel the illusion imagine it

01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:42,150
[Music]

01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:42,150
noise it makes

01:28:44,189 --> 01:28:50,139
and then I wanna swizzle up the side of

01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:52,449
the tree just look how do you want to

01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:55,480
come with me for muscle? well I was gonna

01:28:52,449 --> 01:28:56,889
say, it's like you go first, right okay

01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:58,899
and then it's like I'm one of you, but

01:28:56,890 --> 01:29:00,820
like my skews like your scary friend is

01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:04,029
but I got him don't worry is Beck here

01:29:00,819 --> 01:29:07,149
but if things go south, then I just will

01:29:04,029 --> 01:29:09,189
coil, and we're just like rotoroot an

01:29:07,149 --> 01:29:10,719
entire tree out, and just get all the

01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:12,429
goods. no it's good it's good for you to

01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:14,380
go because if things go south - you can

01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:16,270
tell us, and then we can chop the tree

01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:18,220
numbers yeah you're pretty soon fire

01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:27,640
well it's a very good trick I can't do

01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:31,630
it, but you guys can hear me I can right

01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:34,660
so tell me more about what the sweetest

01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:36,400
of wheezy is doing supposin up the side

01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:42,819
of the tree, and going to the entrance

01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:43,839
and taking a keen smell, which is a

01:29:42,819 --> 01:29:48,159
Perception check, that I have an

01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:50,440
advantage on. when I thank God for you, so

01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:52,930
plus seven six plus seven thirteen the

01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:57,849
number yeah yeah yeah well it doesn't it

01:29:52,930 --> 01:30:01,539
doesn't require a supernatural sense of

01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:08,860
smell, you know, to pick up like twenty

01:30:01,539 --> 01:30:13,769
squirrels Oh any nuts it's just it's

01:30:08,859 --> 01:30:16,449
just that waxy you know squirrel musk.

01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:21,670
all right it's like in your in your

01:30:16,449 --> 01:30:23,649
weaselian form, and the weasel part of

01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:27,430
your mind that you're on constantly sort

01:30:23,649 --> 01:30:28,829
of trying to apply pressure to it you

01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:33,130
know it's good eating.

01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:37,050
mmm you know I mean this is you you wait

01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:37,050
all your life for something like this

01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:46,930
that's like clumpy squirrel man I'm

01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:50,380
slowest I try I really try that's it, but

01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:54,190
I want to take a peek in see if I see

01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:59,640
any nuts in there you do you see a nut

01:30:54,189 --> 01:31:03,309
or two you also see many squirrels, and

01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:06,250
it's just that that shift from daylight

01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:08,410
into the darkness of the of the room;

01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:12,390
there's a lot of fine details you can't

01:31:08,409 --> 01:31:15,789
pick out, but it is not hard at all to

01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:19,000
detect, it doesn't require a roll -- I want

01:31:15,789 --> 01:31:23,729
to emphasize this -- no roll is required to

01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:28,829
detect the two razor-sharp dinner forks

01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:28,829
not pointed directly at your snout.

01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:34,699
[Laughter]

01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:40,300
Dinner forks, but this isn't sound like

01:31:38,109 --> 01:31:44,500
no nobody no no, but they've been Motta

01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:46,989
they've got some aftermarket mods can I

01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:48,789
talk grouse have been on reddit I mean

01:31:46,989 --> 01:31:51,909
they have figured out some terminal

01:31:48,789 --> 01:31:53,590
and squirrel they got a same language

01:31:51,909 --> 01:31:56,590
right I think, so

01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:58,449

mustelids they can talk to you sir

01:31:58,448 --> 01:32:02,829
mollusks. well no it's probably likes

01:32:00,609 --> 01:32:04,420
it's probably like some of the some of

01:32:02,829 --> 01:32:05,649
the old English dialects where they're

01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:07,029
basically different languages, but you

01:32:05,649 --> 01:32:09,819
can still understand each other.

01:32:07,029 --> 01:32:11,679
I'm coiling my way up the tree not as

01:32:09,819 --> 01:32:13,719
fast as you that sounds good

01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:15,760
right there's a, but you he there's a

01:32:13,719 --> 01:32:20,050
voice sort of in the back of the chamber

01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:26,050
hmm this emits a sort of a mourn'd low

01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:27,480
chuckle, and he says letter yeah all

01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:32,949

01:32:32,948 --> 01:32:40,899
clogged fingers up on top pull yourself

01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:43,060
in there are now more forks, even more

01:32:40,899 --> 01:32:46,479
dinner Forks aside

01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:49,900
just just right at every part of you

01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:53,289
that would be the least able to resist a

01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:55,929
fork. mmm these are like brushing just

01:32:53,289 --> 01:32:58,929
brushing along this side as you're

01:32:55,929 --> 01:33:00,279
moving I they mounted inside the tree, or

01:32:58,929 --> 01:33:03,429
they being wheeled over here being

01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:07,019
wielded by squirrels, and it's a squirrel

01:33:03,429 --> 01:33:10,868
guard in the back in the back of this

01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:15,060

face, and I don't know what it portends

01:33:19,179 --> 01:33:27,940

01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:30,730
like a clay pot okay there's sort

01:33:27,939 --> 01:33:33,789
of been warmed up, but the the front of

01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:37,868
it has been broken away, and then seated

01:33:33,789 --> 01:33:41,649
atop a pile of warm dry leaves you can

01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:43,839
see an ancient squirrel, a truly ancient

01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:46,689
squirrel. hmm, and you can tell, and he's

01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:51,929
wearing the cap of an acorn as jaunty

01:33:46,689 --> 01:33:55,779
beret, and then there's three squirrels

01:33:51,929 --> 01:33:59,250
on each side of him, and they're each

01:33:55,779 --> 01:34:02,500
adorned in a different type of nutshell.

01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:02,920
hmm This is the greatest moment of my

very curious as well to it, and the voice

outside, and, so he's just like looking at

01:35:13,539 --> 01:35:20,569
the other nut princes, and it's like

01:35:18,469 --> 01:35:22,730
whenever his gaze reaches them, then they

01:35:20,569 --> 01:35:24,829
have the appropriate response oh yeah

01:35:22,729 --> 01:35:26,299
but a suit, but he's looking over here at

01:35:24,829 --> 01:35:29,390

judges say, and I want you to imagine now

01:35:41,479 --> 01:35:48,919
I'm the DM, I've done this the branch the

01:35:46,939 --> 01:35:49,609
branch that leads up to the

01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:52,699
entrance

01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:56,299
there's no branch oh how do you yeah

01:35:52,698 --> 01:36:00,669
okay then I'll just go right there I the

01:35:56,300 --> 01:36:06,739
the head of Ligotti comes up from the

01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:11,810
base of that opening, and I say

01:36:06,738 --> 01:36:15,198

for sure, and, so I take a quick glance

01:36:19,819 --> 01:36:23,989
back, and I see the look obvious there

01:36:21,979 --> 01:36:34,849
and I say again I'm like, "I need a two

01:36:23,989 --> 01:36:37,189

01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:57,559
entrance. yeah yeah yeah He sniffs the

01:36:52,729 --> 01:37:01,939
air a couple times, he says,"You don't

01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:16,340

01:37:01,939 --> 01:37:21,739

protection while forces annihilated the

01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:34,789
entire world, and now that we have come

01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:39,800
up with a system that allows the Five

01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:48,050
Nut Houses to prosper you're going to

01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:53,000

01:37:57,890 --> 01:38:11,980
you, supporting himself on a spoon. He

01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:11,979
takes a few steps over to you, he says,

01:38:13,329 --> 01:38:20,350
\guy Try to grow to your real size in here,

01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:20,350

01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:33,689
\walnut That's... that's okay. You can go. You can

01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:33,690
leave now.

01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:42,449
Dinner forks glint in the sunlight.

01:38:40,119 --> 01:38:45,250
[Music]

01:38:42,449 --> 01:38:48,279
multiplying the guy's numers ah yeah

01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:53,199
this is ten thousand for bingo chop that

01:38:48,279 --> 01:38:56,609
a tree is a party line opener now you

01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:58,149
can be yeah I'll open it I'll be like

01:38:56,609 --> 01:39:01,719
What's the play?

01:38:58,149 --> 01:39:07,420
I respect what they built

01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:14,230
they're just squirrels with better

01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:16,359
society's grand scheme of things killed

01:39:14,229 --> 01:39:18,309
a lot today looks a lot of dead

01:39:16,359 --> 01:39:20,259
squirrels in our wake just getting to

01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:22,840
this tree. you know I think you need to

01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:24,550
take one chop at this tree hmm I think

01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:26,500
you need to take it down, and just scare

01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:28,029
them just scare him. I

01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:31,420
want you to put the fear of you in them.

01:39:28,029 --> 01:39:35,019
all right dad I can do. I haven't met a

01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:41,590
squirrel I can't scare. I just look at

01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:43,900
the guy you get out tooth brother

01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:45,970
Toothbrush, but I won't with a spiky side

01:39:43,899 --> 01:39:47,439
yeah I was thinking like if I had to one

01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:50,320
strike I would smite this, but I won't

01:39:47,439 --> 01:40:02,919
I'll just give it a good just to shake

01:39:50,319 --> 01:40:06,699
the out of it. I love it, so you feel

01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:10,750
do you feel the the impact of what you

01:40:06,699 --> 01:40:15,569
are certain is Toothbrush I'm wielded by

01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:20,800
a dangerous and a deeply unsocialized

01:40:15,569 --> 01:40:23,920
young man. Its shakes, and he is able he

01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:28,829
catches himself on his spoon, and he just

01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:32,380
shakes his head, and they all scamper

01:40:28,829 --> 01:40:34,239
behind the throne, picking up nuts as

01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:37,989
they go.

01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:41,609
And then you can see, one by one, they

01:40:37,989 --> 01:40:51,699
certainly go down into a set of tunnels

01:40:41,609 --> 01:40:55,479
that are inside the tree. We're only

01:40:51,699 --> 01:41:00,519
asking for ten acorns. it's just what's

01:40:55,479 --> 01:41:03,939
ten to him, so I look at the can I go um

01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:08,110
I go,'What's it gonna take for me to walk

01:41:03,939 --> 01:41:11,949
out of here with two acorns? I tell them

01:41:08,109 --> 01:41:13,719
about my almond I say we got 500, and

01:41:11,949 --> 01:41:18,369
some green, and some gray, and then we'll

01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:20,320
chop the tree down. so, so you're sort of

01:41:18,369 --> 01:41:22,930
looking, and you can see that him and his

01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:26,679
entourage yeah have cast down this thing

01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:34,890
at the mention of almonds. hmm you hear a

01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:37,000
sound coming back up, so when he emerges

01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:41,860
you can tell he has something like a

01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:46,060
pontiff's cap, but it is all of brilliant,

01:41:41,859 --> 01:41:53,079
bleached nut shells. mm-hmm, and he says

01:41:46,060 --> 01:42:00,130
he says I cannot I cannot betray my

01:41:53,079 --> 01:42:05,199
father completely, but I am NOT unwise. He

01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:08,920
says,

\guy I have nuts. Nuts I'm willing to

01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:14,649
share, but there is a task I would have

01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:16,300
you do. What do you want? 

\dm He says, there is

01:42:14,649 --> 01:42:20,829
a place we squirrels call the black

01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:25,390
Valley mm-hmm, and in this valley there

01:42:20,829 --> 01:42:27,069
are treasures beyond counting mm-hmm, but

01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:36,340
it is guarded by a mighty beast a beast

01:42:27,069 --> 01:42:38,058
we tell our our kids of mm-hmm sit what

01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:41,239
what kind of Beast

01:42:38,059 --> 01:42:46,130
well he doesn't talk about it I mean he

01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:51,738
he a shudder goes through his body, and

01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:54,949
he says a beast that could do this, and

01:42:51,738 --> 01:42:59,269
he turns his cloak falls, and you see

01:42:54,948 --> 01:43:06,049
three claws right down the back, and a

01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:10,190
raking angle, and he taps his Fork a

01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:13,849
couple times on the floor, and says I was

01:43:10,189 --> 01:43:20,288
not without valor, but this creature is

01:43:13,849 --> 01:43:20,288
impossible to defeat I can't see that

01:43:21,219 --> 01:43:30,469
he's just bring me the beasts head no

01:43:24,828 --> 01:43:34,849
but I can't get you any treasure from

01:43:30,469 --> 01:43:44,210
inside there that you want, and he says

peas potato peel hey I translate for you

01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:36,460
because you're still in was a farm burn

01:45:38,439 --> 01:45:48,409
just put them in there yeah the bowl of

01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:50,380
soup symbol a sauce that's it I care How

01:45:48,409 --> 01:45:52,429
are we always doing quests for animals?

01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:57,770
Why are we getting bossed around by

01:45:52,429 --> 01:46:01,119
animals? counter-plan

01:45:57,770 --> 01:46:03,770
I just go crazy in murder office guys

01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:05,448
wow they're squirrels

01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:10,730
there's no reason I'm looking right at

01:46:05,448 --> 01:46:12,469
you there's a principle involved a

01:46:10,729 --> 01:46:15,139
certain point you don't have to do this

01:46:12,469 --> 01:46:16,550
just they can't understand yeah that's

01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:21,230
true we can just talk right in front of

01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:23,300
them. What about the mystery squirrel?

01:46:21,229 --> 01:46:24,919
What if we take an acorn, dip it in gold

01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,460
we all put one little finger on it, and

01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,210
then we're there.

01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:30,739
do we really need four acorns? a quarter

01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:32,810
of me to end up there I don't know how

01:46:30,738 --> 01:46:41,019
it works. Well, that's true we don't have

01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:45,080
an acorn is spared well everybody else

01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:46,520
all right let's go to the store yeah now

01:46:45,079 --> 01:46:50,059
we got to go on a quest because the

01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:52,460
rabbits took all the carrots. no I know

01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:54,610
how this works I think we come back with

01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:58,679
Onyx's head instead this was easier

01:46:54,609 --> 01:47:00,759
[Laughter]

01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:01,420
bring it up I mean that's something you

01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:04,210
get a winch

01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:10,029
well back across the street you're on

01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:12,340
accord rummage through the garbage heaps

01:47:10,029 --> 01:47:15,579
yeah we do you know what they like all

01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:17,469
right, so we do that will you that thing

01:47:15,579 --> 01:47:19,750
then we went in, and then we bring it all

01:47:17,469 --> 01:47:22,198
back, and we put it in a tiny little

01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:26,829
backpack, and put on sweet Wheezy

01:47:22,198 --> 01:47:28,329
yeah real slow climb a tree weighted

01:47:26,829 --> 01:47:29,439
down by all this stuff. Jerry's looking

01:47:28,329 --> 01:47:31,260
at you like maybe we didn't get the

01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:33,309
stuff we didn't get the stuff do we know

01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:37,060
not hard okay okay

01:47:33,310 --> 01:47:38,440
no no your place shame oh no Jimmy

01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,909
was the best game of all time I'll tell

01:47:38,439 --> 01:47:41,710
you why, and then we'll keep playing to

01:47:39,908 --> 01:47:43,750
Israel, so Shenmue is the best game of

01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:46,539
all time because there's a point where

01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:48,399
you need to go into a dark place, and you

01:47:46,539 --> 01:47:49,389
have a flashlight, but the flashlight is

01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:51,098
out of battery, it's like this is a

01:47:49,389 --> 01:47:54,279
regular problem, and then you literally

01:47:51,099 --> 01:47:55,779
go to like the corner store, and _buy

01:47:54,279 --> 01:47:56,948
batteries_ yeah, and then you put the

01:47:55,779 --> 01:47:58,329
batteries in there, and then you can go

01:47:56,948 --> 01:48:00,309
downstairs. Like it's not even a

01:47:58,329 --> 01:48:01,539
joke, and it's like it's also like God,

01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:03,190
when is the bus gonna get here? And

01:48:01,539 --> 01:48:04,359
there's like a bus schedule, yeah

01:48:03,189 --> 01:48:09,519
and then you need to get money, and you

01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:10,868
go into your forklift job. It's like dude,

01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:15,460
it kicks ass, and you get fender the long

01:48:10,868 --> 01:48:17,229
chop. it's awesome, so that is exactly

01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:19,929
right, so you... come back now, do you

01:48:17,229 --> 01:48:22,988
do you overdo it? Like do you get 

01:48:19,929 --> 01:48:25,599
three scraps of potato, or like yeah

01:48:22,988 --> 01:48:28,329
I think I do, oh yeah like it's such a

01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:30,550
humble little ask, and they're just

01:48:28,329 --> 01:48:33,969
squirrels. That's fine, I just bring the

01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:35,739
garbage can. yeah just like you can have

01:48:33,969 --> 01:48:37,539
any of it here, so how are you gonna how

01:48:35,738 --> 01:48:39,729
are you gonna prepare all this like um

01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:42,670
what does it look like? I think probably

01:48:39,729 --> 01:48:44,769
it's it is like a little sack that's

01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:46,270
packed with extras of everything, and I

01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:47,469
add some stuff in there that I think

01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:50,590
they might like, that maybe they haven't

01:48:47,469 --> 01:48:52,329
tried before. We got some like, kale -- it's

01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:56,139
wilted, its kind of gnarly, but they're

01:48:52,329 --> 01:48:59,439
squirrels. yeah We've got some almonds,

01:48:56,139 --> 01:49:03,190
just some almonds in there yeah yeah

01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:04,868
some mom some cheese, I stick a

01:49:03,189 --> 01:49:06,428
little wedge of cheese in there, and you

01:49:04,868 --> 01:49:09,000
guys are all judging me I'm like this

01:49:06,429 --> 01:49:09,000
Shut up, all right?

01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:16,220
nicer than the yarn us thank you

01:49:12,859 --> 01:49:19,369
I'm delighted like I'm not

01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:21,980
I mean I'm mad that this is taking so

01:49:19,369 --> 01:49:25,159
long, but I'm also so excited to spend

01:49:21,979 --> 01:49:28,759
time in the presence of such small minds.

01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:31,609
Where this is a huge ask the challenge

01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:33,800
your brain isn't even large enough to

01:49:31,609 --> 01:49:35,329
imagine the thing that we can't bring

01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:37,340
you know I like that K'thriss is just

01:49:35,329 --> 01:49:38,779
feeling superior to a squirrel.

01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:42,409
well like let's see what they do with

01:49:38,779 --> 01:49:45,229
this. Look at all these treats, and it's

01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:48,139
impeccably packed up and tied. Oh

watching it, and he's just like kneading

01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:44,788
his tail with delight and desire. I

01:55:23,309 --> 01:55:27,279
silver, this is gonna go on forever yeah

01:55:25,630 --> 01:55:32,170
they're gonna end with are these all

01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:35,939
melted tourmaline, and then I take the

01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:38,440
gold one, and unscrew it. I take mine,

01:55:35,939 --> 01:55:41,169
carefully dip the catalyst, and ice, and

01:55:38,439 --> 01:55:43,178
then I see it was like a gold leaf yeah

01:55:41,170 --> 01:55:47,800
Thank you. Ever seen that?

01:55:43,179 --> 01:55:50,440
oh yeah oh yeah have you ever seen yeah

01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:55,230
those videos mm-hmm dip your nut I dip

01:55:50,439 --> 01:55:59,469
my nut to bag it right in there no yeah

01:55:55,229 --> 01:56:01,238
so I also like the same yes I also do

01:55:59,469 --> 01:56:03,730
the thing. I do it as well

01:56:01,238 --> 01:56:06,599
with great pleasure a double dip, and

01:56:03,729 --> 01:56:14,799
make sure good base come down yep

01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:17,980
nothing to say about that yeah Do you

01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:20,230
have your tools? yeah uh we did this

01:56:17,979 --> 01:56:24,279
outside we did the second we walk to the

01:56:20,229 --> 01:56:25,809
door yes should we yell in there, and

01:56:24,279 --> 01:56:28,119
give everyone a heads up, "oh we're about

01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:30,640
to do..." Well, they're not gonna know. no

01:56:28,119 --> 01:56:32,408
they'll just watch us go. Well, the

01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:35,260
Propha knows. we'd still profit I'll

01:56:32,408 --> 01:56:35,799
watch my room watch okay it's on at

01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:38,530
first.

01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:40,119
Watch that stair. Yes, doing that. Yeah

01:56:38,529 --> 01:56:42,279
switches got our eye oh yeah oh yeah

01:56:40,119 --> 01:56:45,880
when I suspected profit, and you've

01:56:42,279 --> 01:56:48,698
you've seen the relationship since

01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:52,390
you've been back Propha has a Propha

01:56:48,698 --> 01:56:55,539
keeps a pretty firm eye on Auspicia.

01:56:52,390 --> 01:56:57,400
All right, by going Test Market. I can't

01:56:55,539 --> 01:56:59,679
believe we're volunteering primarily

01:56:57,399 --> 01:57:01,719
going back to the Test Market. No one

01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:03,460
wants to do it less than me I just... it

01:57:01,719 --> 01:57:09,719
all sudden hits me, I'm like why are we

01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:09,719
doing this? All right this is the MINIX

01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:14,890
we saw ahead. We cheated, basically. I mean,

01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:18,480
we're going back we know the exam that's

01:57:14,890 --> 01:57:23,369
true answers, so then it's true okay

01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:26,799
let's do this I said I go through first.

01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:30,250
all right, so hand me your-- as you're

01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:32,730
walking through individually, you're

01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:37,649
experiencing that same cold sensation,

01:57:32,729 --> 01:57:41,379
and as you are walking through, Walnut,

01:57:37,649 --> 01:57:45,639
Auspicia at you in that moment it says

01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:50,489
oh no oh geez

01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:56,440
and, so as you pop in, you are present in

01:57:50,488 --> 01:58:03,488
an inn called the Dran and Courtier and

01:57:56,439 --> 01:58:08,469
all the patrons of this bar are Dran and Courtiers,

01:58:03,488 --> 01:58:10,929
and like inns, little bunch of

01:58:08,469 --> 01:58:14,680
little inns I love it yeah they are

01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:18,159
drinking Dran and Courtiers from

01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:20,050
smaller Dran and Courtiers, it's great. Oh

01:58:18,159 --> 01:58:22,539
boy, somebody replaced all the texture

01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:23,829
files. yeah yeah exactly it's like it's

01:58:22,539 --> 01:58:25,359
like when there's an error on a window,

01:58:23,829 --> 01:58:29,729
and you're like trying to move it around

01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:32,170
it's just more, and more everywhere

01:58:29,729 --> 01:58:35,559
so some of it yeah exactly

01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:37,930
so then the Dran and Courtiers look over

01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:40,660
at you they raise their beams, and glass

01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:44,520
sort of creaking, and they raise their

01:58:40,659 --> 01:58:44,519
Dran and Courtiers to you as you come in.

01:58:45,569 --> 01:58:55,719
Do we look like ourselves? Yes as much as

01:58:51,579 --> 01:58:58,479
much as that might delight one. No no in

01:58:55,719 --> 01:59:02,489
fact, and what's what's different here is

01:58:58,479 --> 01:59:04,359
that this Dran and Courtier;

01:59:02,488 --> 01:59:06,819
historically looking at the window you

01:59:04,359 --> 01:59:09,849
wouldn't see much, right? The previous

01:59:06,819 --> 01:59:15,729
adventure this this Dran and Courtier

01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:21,579
appears to exist in a place you look out

01:59:15,729 --> 01:59:26,129
the window and see, and as near as you

01:59:21,579 --> 01:59:34,170
can tell, infinite

01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:36,659
not necessarily defined plane of colors.

01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:40,210
hmm interesting

01:59:36,659 --> 01:59:46,269
okay well in that sort of

01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:48,880
formless expanse, you can see various

01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:51,670
shapes, just sort of moving of their own

01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:55,090
accord, but there's no up or

01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:58,390
down -- their their motions exist according

01:59:55,090 --> 02:00:02,020
to some physical understanding that you

01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:04,449
are not familiar with. Okay I'm at that

02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:07,179
window. Well, I care about these inns.

02:00:04,448 --> 02:00:09,799
I'm gonna go sidle up to an inn. They

02:00:07,179 --> 02:00:11,270
greeted us which one

02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:19,340
but looked like they were into me about

02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:25,060
The inn behind the bar says,

02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:25,060
\inn What would be. This is a Dran and Courtier.

02:00:26,350 --> 02:00:36,710
it's all frothy Jonica, so he grits he

02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:38,510
because he was just sort of absent-mindedly 

02:00:36,710 --> 02:00:43,399
cleaning a Dran and Courtier

02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:45,680
behind the bar, and so he he goes back to

02:00:43,399 --> 02:00:49,670
our Dran and Courtier, and pulls out a

02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:54,950
thick thick glass of Dran and Courtier, and

02:00:49,670 --> 02:00:57,619
sets it on the drunk warrior. Cheers.

02:00:54,949 --> 02:01:02,869
yeah yeah. His shutters sort of

02:00:57,619 --> 02:01:05,149
flap with delight yeah you seen anyone

02:01:02,869 --> 02:01:07,930
else come through here? He's like, you

02:01:05,149 --> 02:01:09,789
know we don't get a lot of visitors. yeah

02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:15,020
rains it pours

02:01:09,789 --> 02:01:20,680
yeah right tell me man classic, classic.

02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:30,830
and then roofs keep out rain anyway Wow

02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:32,990
building yeah I own new whores floors

02:01:30,829 --> 02:01:34,340
are clean, a room square footage I'm

02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:38,210
lovin your buildings inside a building

02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:41,810
is weird to them. Open-concept, yeah huh

02:01:38,210 --> 02:01:44,930
all right, so yeah, so wait did you go

02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:47,539
yeah yeah she's just out a dad Dran and 

02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:49,909
Courtier, and they looked mm-hmm let's go

02:01:47,539 --> 02:01:51,859
yeah yeah let me to finish your Dran and 

02:01:49,909 --> 02:01:53,779
Courtier. well obviously, it's rude not to.

02:01:51,859 --> 02:01:54,799
right yeah it's like it's like you can't

02:01:53,779 --> 02:01:59,779
drink you can't bring it with you like

02:01:54,800 --> 02:02:02,260
yeah I try to drink it liquid it Dran

02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:02,259
and Courtiers.

02:02:03,729 --> 02:02:09,619
everyone would be like water molecules

02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:12,680
are just little inns. It's like, I don't

02:02:09,619 --> 02:02:17,239
know, I mean it's like it's like drinking

02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:20,659
a hamburger. hey hey I love this. It's

02:02:17,239 --> 02:02:23,349
like, think about drinking such a solid

02:02:20,659 --> 02:02:27,269
thing yeah, but it takes _work_.

02:02:23,349 --> 02:02:27,269
But it's not as bad as you would expect.

02:02:27,748 --> 02:02:43,628
like a duck can taste a Johnny -

02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:45,429
standing there gonna be like, when do you,

02:02:43,628 --> 02:02:46,538
like, die. Like, I want to make sure this

02:02:45,429 --> 02:02:49,029
seems like the kind of thing -- could this

02:02:46,538 --> 02:02:51,908
would be like oh is this how alcohol

02:02:49,029 --> 02:02:54,099
works in this realm? I-- so I do ask before

02:02:51,908 --> 02:02:58,179
we go yes it's the drunk, or deer yeah I

02:02:54,099 --> 02:03:00,279
I say what how do you differentiate this?

02:02:58,179 --> 02:03:05,408
Is it cannibalism? Why are you not

02:03:00,279 --> 02:03:09,099
offended that this how what you're the

02:03:05,408 --> 02:03:11,948
same object, that he's now ingesting oh

02:03:09,099 --> 02:03:17,590
boy I think they are. You're the same

02:03:11,948 --> 02:03:19,478
object as him. yeah yeah, but I don't eat

02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:22,869
him when he dies. I will eat him. Oh, it's

02:03:19,479 --> 02:03:24,219
true, we talked about God. Oh yeah, I miss

02:03:22,868 --> 02:03:28,748
our friendship pact, is it he says you

02:03:24,219 --> 02:03:37,418
know what I think? You need tricorder

02:03:28,748 --> 02:03:42,099
Make it a double. Make it a duplex very

02:03:37,418 --> 02:03:48,309
he sets him up, pushes him over, and I am

02:03:42,099 --> 02:03:49,659
going to use my Cauldron ability, because

02:03:48,309 --> 02:03:51,159
they've filled up super fast. That was

02:03:49,658 --> 02:03:54,009
busy hooking everybody up with all this

02:03:51,158 --> 02:03:56,918
crazy squirrel, but whenever the bar

02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:58,599
fills up I get to do something cool, and

02:03:56,918 --> 02:04:00,398
I have a table that I can do it from. So

02:03:58,599 --> 02:04:03,788
out-of-combat Table is different from

02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:08,429
the in-combat Table, and, so in this in

02:04:03,788 --> 02:04:11,139
this case you can see the facade of the

02:04:08,429 --> 02:04:14,109
Dran and Courtier behind the bar taking on

02:04:11,139 --> 02:04:15,099
a slightly different shape. He's like, so

02:04:14,109 --> 02:04:19,269
was that guy a friend of yours?

02:04:15,099 --> 02:04:21,309
Oh yeah. Best friend, really. yeah okay

02:04:19,269 --> 02:04:24,070
what do you you probably want to meet up

02:04:21,309 --> 02:04:26,679
with him fast, and yes, so kind of a rough

02:04:24,069 --> 02:04:28,708
neighborhood I agree. He's like, Well you

02:04:26,679 --> 02:04:31,300
know, I got a dude up a dinghy out back

02:04:28,708 --> 02:04:33,878
that's what your let's yes what's it

02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:35,529
look? like go look at it

02:04:33,878 --> 02:04:38,619
All right. Looks like a dinghy. You want

02:04:35,529 --> 02:04:42,009
to take a guess, and what it looks

02:04:38,619 --> 02:04:43,960
I wanna see the ocean. yeah sure the

02:04:42,010 --> 02:04:46,090
water. I say, Thank you for your

02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:46,810
kindness though. still mentioned it bring

02:04:46,090 --> 02:04:49,569
it back when you can.

02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:52,480
Happy to. What a nice turn corner yeah

02:04:49,569 --> 02:04:53,189
right exactly is this the trunk, or

02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:55,659
nearest fan

02:04:53,189 --> 02:04:58,269
What do you see? This is the nice one

02:04:55,659 --> 02:05:01,599
yeah yeah this is the grandad run

02:04:58,270 --> 02:05:05,680
accordion obviously you know you pay a

02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:09,520
little bit more, but yeah. So you leave

02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:12,280
out the front door, and then the ground

02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,480
itself appears to just be they imagined

02:05:12,279 --> 02:05:16,000
that you would sort of measure that a

02:05:13,479 --> 02:05:17,619
child had drawn a chalk line around the

02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,170
Dran and Courtier, and then it has been

02:05:17,619 --> 02:05:23,609
placed somewhere, and that's what it is, 

02:05:20,170 --> 02:05:27,300
except that the space around that land

02:05:23,609 --> 02:05:32,109
exists again in this undifferentiated,

02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:34,090
silverish expanse that goes out, and then,

02:05:32,109 --> 02:05:39,069
you know, much like you

02:05:34,090 --> 02:05:42,460
would have a dock, or something of that

02:05:39,069 --> 02:05:44,889
nature, like an oceanside -- you know like

02:05:42,460 --> 02:05:47,460
on lakefront property, there is a dock

02:05:44,890 --> 02:05:51,190
literally suspended in the air,

02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:55,689
projecting out from this piece

02:05:51,189 --> 02:06:00,609
of unmoored real estate, and next to it

02:05:55,689 --> 02:06:02,859
there is a tiny boat. It looks for all

02:06:00,609 --> 02:06:06,369
intents and purposes _like_ a tiny boat,

02:06:02,859 --> 02:06:08,279
except that it appears to be okay doing

02:06:06,369 --> 02:06:11,739
what it's doing, which is to say being

02:06:08,279 --> 02:06:13,809
oriented in space. Hmm okay, all right.

02:06:11,739 --> 02:06:15,189
It's comforting. I mean, like I say when

02:06:13,810 --> 02:06:18,130
you look out and you see the strange

02:06:15,189 --> 02:06:21,369
shapes that move in this infinite place,

02:06:18,130 --> 02:06:24,069
it's like that episode of-- near

02:06:21,369 --> 02:06:26,199
the end of the finale of Star Trek, where

02:06:24,069 --> 02:06:26,489
it's like, typically speaking in Star

02:06:26,199 --> 02:06:28,359
Trek,

02:06:26,489 --> 02:06:30,309
everybody just fights in a naval way,

02:06:28,359 --> 02:06:31,599
yeah, but then sometimes looks like

02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:33,370
what's like well that's how it should

02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:34,840
always be, right? Yeah, and it's just like

02:06:33,369 --> 02:06:36,970
that when you look out there. There's no

02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:40,060
rules. Just right. It's like the Outback

02:06:36,970 --> 02:06:41,190
Steakhouse. Yeah, it's like a conceptual

02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:44,560
Outback Steakhouse.

02:06:41,189 --> 02:06:47,979
What did you say, so that is the Olive

02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:49,930
Garden? yeah Kate sorry Jerry.

02:06:47,979 --> 02:06:51,549
And to this is an infinite press

02:06:49,930 --> 02:06:54,100
next Howdy's cool treats I get it.

02:06:51,550 --> 02:06:57,190
Actually, I'm a Dungeons and Dragons game

02:06:54,100 --> 02:07:03,360
designer now, and that is the Outback

02:06:57,189 --> 02:07:09,399
Steakhouse, and boats, and boats can be

02:07:03,359 --> 02:07:15,729
lycanthropes. Oh no no we're bow we're

02:07:09,399 --> 02:07:22,299
boat don't be the first no no, so he told

02:07:15,729 --> 02:07:25,719
so, but you feel very strange,

02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:28,119
Rosie, looking at this boat attached in

02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:29,890
this place. Okay. I would love it if he

02:07:28,119 --> 02:07:31,479
would give me a History check. I would

02:07:29,890 --> 02:07:33,190
love to take advantage on that History

02:07:31,479 --> 02:07:35,559
check. Oh, I would love to give you

02:07:33,189 --> 02:07:37,089
advantage, or a rate. Thanks Council

02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:41,530
Shadow Council. Damn that's nice.

02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:43,890
Twenty-one. Jeez. So as you walk

02:07:41,529 --> 02:07:47,559
closer to it, but you are getting

02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:51,910
what you know would commonly be called

02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:53,980
The Feels. sir good there just Feels okay.

02:07:51,909 --> 02:07:57,699
They're emanating from this craft.

02:07:53,979 --> 02:08:06,789
Interesting. And there's a friend. For a

02:07:57,699 --> 02:08:10,349
second you can see yourself young, and

02:08:06,789 --> 02:08:13,890
you can see your hand on this tiller, and

02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:18,970
then you can see your father in the boat

02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:22,810
with you, and he says, "A boat is a boat is

02:08:18,970 --> 02:08:26,980
a boat."

Dad did used to say that a lot.

02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:29,230
yeah okay do I does though does the

02:08:26,979 --> 02:08:30,819
image show for anybody else? Doesn't no.

02:08:29,229 --> 02:08:34,629
no no no this is just this is just

02:08:30,819 --> 02:08:36,279
something that _you_ see here. And does it

02:08:34,630 --> 02:08:38,619
persist as I get close? oh it just

02:08:36,279 --> 02:08:41,590
flashes. No no you just you just know

02:08:38,619 --> 02:08:44,849
that it happened. Okay you know that it

02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:49,029
happened. Okay I think I know how to

02:08:44,850 --> 02:08:51,520
drive this boat, and I don't know how to

02:08:49,029 --> 02:08:54,000
explain to you how, but I think if we get

02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:57,610
in, we'll get to where we need to be.

02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,989
don't I come it's me it's great looking

02:08:57,609 --> 02:09:02,649
you out yeah you seem to know your way

02:08:58,989 --> 02:09:04,449
around boat. yeah alright you're okay.

02:09:02,649 --> 02:09:05,079
yeah Everybody's gonna have to make some

02:09:04,449 --> 02:09:08,349
space.

02:09:05,079 --> 02:09:12,090
Get cozy, folks. All right, I want to like

02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:14,950
wow while we board I want to grab my my

02:09:12,090 --> 02:09:17,680
and just see if I get any like I want to

02:09:14,949 --> 02:09:19,989
understand the nature of this space, its

02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:24,039
plan. Is it anything that resembles that

02:09:19,989 --> 02:09:26,019
contorted extra-dimensional 

02:09:24,039 --> 02:09:28,569
space that I've been in

02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:31,660
before? Imagine the sense that you get is

02:09:28,569 --> 02:09:35,049
that they're like _familial_, that 

02:09:31,659 --> 02:09:38,619
these spaces are related. yeah you think

02:09:35,050 --> 02:09:41,320
that when you were in the

02:09:38,619 --> 02:09:45,670
Test Market, it's possible that you are

02:09:41,319 --> 02:09:48,670
seeing it in a transition state where it

02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:51,100
achieved a kind of maximum chaos, but

02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:53,529
then that had to subside at some point.

02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:57,900
It can't always be a place where every

02:09:53,529 --> 02:10:00,750
thought and word becomes constituted. Hmm,

02:09:57,899 --> 02:10:05,289
so this is either a new place altogether,

02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:11,859
or just a decrepit version of the other

02:10:05,289 --> 02:10:14,590
space. Okay, delicious. I'm on board. But as

02:10:11,859 --> 02:10:15,880
soon as

02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:21,550
you take it out, and you're just

02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:27,190
meditating on its, you know, impermeable

02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:29,230
truths -- it's almost like the way young

02:10:27,189 --> 02:10:32,589
people for examplem imagine if a Ouija

02:10:29,229 --> 02:10:35,219
board were real. That kind of tug, where

02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:41,230
it's almost just the level of instinct

02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:42,880
it exists like you've ever had a

02:10:41,229 --> 02:10:44,369
gyroscope, and tried to twist the poles?

02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:47,409
It's like that,

02:10:44,369 --> 02:10:51,670
like there is a place in an orientation

02:10:47,409 --> 02:10:54,220
around that it wants to be. Is this

02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:58,170
within the confines of the boat. No no no,

02:10:54,220 --> 02:11:06,430
it's in the confines of this _place_. Okay

02:10:58,170 --> 02:11:09,699
being a tug already. Yeah, it's like what

02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:12,760
he's 560 I mean yeah yeah I'm man no I

02:11:09,699 --> 02:11:16,149
know my dress tides the 380 middle aged.

02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:18,860
I don't know if that means we should go

02:11:16,149 --> 02:11:23,359
toward that, or do _not_ go to it. You

02:11:18,859 --> 02:11:27,889
what you feel is best. Maybe we come back,

02:11:23,359 --> 02:11:31,339
maybe not. We got a job. Maybe I jump off

02:11:27,889 --> 02:11:33,770
the boat soon, who knows? Donaar's there

02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:37,880
really is a theory it really isn't a

02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:39,889
place for a Donaar in here. yeah no no

02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:47,170
you're trying to figure out her husband

02:11:39,889 --> 02:11:52,929
yeah where is the Norwood go inside this

02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:56,029
space yeah it's probably enough for

02:11:52,929 --> 02:11:58,250
Justin are ya

02:11:56,029 --> 02:12:01,039
we're not that big though, we could just

02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:03,408
Senate sit on the back ER oh you guys

02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:07,250
could just swing behind. You could sit in

02:12:03,408 --> 02:12:11,359
it. yeah just hold on yeah it's pile up

02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:13,488
one elf on one knee, the other elf on

02:12:11,359 --> 02:12:15,908
the other knee. You can turn yourself

02:12:13,488 --> 02:12:19,488
into smaller animals. you get smaller

02:12:15,908 --> 02:12:23,289
that was my small one did that I already

02:12:19,488 --> 02:12:34,339
did that quick Ned got us here quick nap

02:12:23,289 --> 02:12:36,109
yeah you crocodile it up no no only got

02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:37,639
big stuff. Sorry remember I took all

02:12:36,109 --> 02:12:40,939
those big things, and I was like oops new

02:12:37,639 --> 02:12:43,460
small thing yeah yeah the trial app

02:12:40,939 --> 02:12:45,500
scenario we're gonna have to file up

02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:51,439
yeah I will

02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:54,229
well not not I'll do the shoulders not

02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:58,879
the lap okay never the lap. I will never

02:12:54,229 --> 02:13:04,339
sit on Donaar's lap. hold you like I'll

02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:05,960
do like a baby. Fine, except that I don't

02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:08,060
accept being held like a baby. She's like

02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:09,319
it's curled into a ball, and first it's

02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:10,969
like she doesn't want to be on her back,

02:13:09,319 --> 02:13:14,289
so he's trying to maintain like on her

02:13:10,969 --> 02:13:17,359
side the whole time like she has any

02:13:14,289 --> 02:13:21,829
it's like a side plank. Yeah, she's

02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:26,359
working her core her core is engaged my

02:13:21,829 --> 02:13:28,649
girl absolutely whatever space there

02:13:26,359 --> 02:13:32,460
though yeah

02:13:28,649 --> 02:13:34,859
okay, so yes sir yes oh yeah, and rest

02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:37,739
your hand on the tiller. Yeah is is it

02:13:34,859 --> 02:13:39,750
indeed pulling me toward this sense that

02:13:37,739 --> 02:13:42,449
good threats have? Well no, as soon

02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:44,609
whenever he whenever you have it -- I mean

02:13:42,449 --> 02:13:48,090
it _feels_ like you're placing it in the

02:13:44,609 --> 02:13:50,670
right place. It's like you have the right

02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:53,069
shake yeah, and then, and then as he's

02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:55,319
holding it out, you guide the boat in

02:13:53,069 --> 02:13:57,359
that direction. I just used to throw the

02:13:55,319 --> 02:13:59,579
tiller, and you just want to go there

02:13:57,359 --> 02:14:02,369
nice okay you remember. It's like riding

02:13:59,579 --> 02:14:05,550
a boat. yeah right do you remember you

02:14:02,369 --> 02:14:08,760
remember that it's just about wanting to

02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:10,619
okay right, and so I'm remembering an

02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:14,100
ability to drive this boat. That's right.

02:14:10,619 --> 02:14:16,949
I don't actually have that's right okay

02:14:14,100 --> 02:14:19,560
um That is correct. So don't be confused

02:14:16,949 --> 02:14:23,789
that's like literally what happened. Nice.

02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:28,740
You perceived it correctly. So but 

02:14:23,789 --> 02:14:30,090
the air itself is pulling the boat in

02:14:28,739 --> 02:14:32,729
this direction,

02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:36,350
after you've guided it away from the

02:14:32,729 --> 02:14:42,899
dock. This thing is pulling you at

02:14:36,350 --> 02:14:45,800
greater and greater speeds, until it

02:14:42,899 --> 02:14:50,189
erupts into something like two

02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:53,640
shimmering black sails. Your third does

02:14:50,189 --> 02:14:55,979
to her does alright, and then it sort of

02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:57,090
it like _beats_. So it isn't like a classic

02:14:55,979 --> 02:15:00,359
sail, it's not catching something,

02:14:57,090 --> 02:15:04,500
it's just beating. And

02:15:00,359 --> 02:15:06,689
you can feel it pulling. I mean it's

02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:09,029
just it's so difficult to tell what the

02:15:06,689 --> 02:15:11,129
speed is when you don't have these

02:15:09,029 --> 02:15:15,029
reference points. yeah, And the reference

02:15:11,130 --> 02:15:17,069
points you _do_ have are at odd angles. We

02:15:15,029 --> 02:15:21,179
feel acceleration okay you are getting

02:15:17,069 --> 02:15:23,519
to hold yeah yeah, and, so the only way

02:15:21,180 --> 02:15:25,470
that you can know eventually how fast

02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:29,070
you must have authentically been going

02:15:25,470 --> 02:15:35,909
is that there is a point in the distance

02:15:29,069 --> 02:15:40,380
that is dark in this otherwise

02:15:35,909 --> 02:15:42,659
silver-edged place, and it is

02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:45,600
getting closer and

02:15:42,659 --> 02:15:48,720
closer and closer to the boat, until it

02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:53,180
consumes almost the whole of your vision

02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:58,949
and this is a place that you have been

02:15:53,180 --> 02:16:02,159
before. This is the very cathedral of the

02:15:58,949 --> 02:16:04,800
earth. You have been there as well,

02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:10,289
Walnut, during the battle with the

02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:14,119
lighthouse creature. And the boat is

02:16:10,289 --> 02:16:18,439
pulling itself up to the bottom, as

02:16:14,119 --> 02:16:24,809
through this aperture in the base of

02:16:18,439 --> 02:16:28,460
this entity that you have a complex

02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:32,460
relationship with, to say the least.

02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:37,468
you know I'm well there's no place to

02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:39,718
kneel I crouch down on you

02:16:37,468 --> 02:16:41,399
and I'm looking up expectantly. I'm

02:16:39,718 --> 02:16:44,189
trying to show that deference; I'm trying

02:16:41,399 --> 02:16:47,729
to soak in as much as I can of this is

02:16:44,190 --> 02:16:49,800
this the red tinged that

02:16:47,729 --> 02:16:51,359
shape? Yes. Or is it the one that I was

02:16:49,799 --> 02:16:54,329
shown, which was blackness,

02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:58,530
which I saw beyond sight? yeah exactly no

02:16:54,329 --> 02:17:02,340
this here is that

02:16:58,530 --> 02:17:04,440
crystalline palace where it all occurred

02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:06,389
to you sorry. The way that you perceive

02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:08,190
it is slightly different from the way

02:17:06,389 --> 02:17:09,989
that everyone else perceives it, but you

02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:11,730
know exactly what it is, and you know

02:17:09,989 --> 02:17:12,780
exactly way it is. Two of you have never

02:17:11,729 --> 02:17:14,429
seen this before,

02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:18,920
so let me give you the extra details

02:17:14,429 --> 02:17:25,440
that you might need. Imagine a kind of

02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:32,610
octagon made of sheer amethyst, whose

02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:38,000
walls rise a tremendous distance toward

02:17:32,610 --> 02:17:42,690
a kind of crown. Sharp blades, and then

02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:46,350
the boat that you are captaining has

02:17:42,690 --> 02:17:50,280
gone underneath it, and then you are

02:17:46,350 --> 02:17:52,170
able to maintain a kind of plane, and, so

02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:54,329
the cool when you get underneath it you

02:17:52,170 --> 02:17:56,039
can see that it's kind of like tilting,

02:17:54,329 --> 02:17:59,459
and maybe even listing

02:17:56,039 --> 02:18:01,139
in this space actively, or is it dr.

02:17:59,459 --> 02:18:03,328

02:18:01,138 --> 02:18:07,978
you wouldn't know it appears is not

02:18:03,328 --> 02:18:10,318
stationary. Ah okay, and, and this is

02:18:07,978 --> 02:18:11,938
floating in a void that seems boundless.

02:18:10,318 --> 02:18:15,868
yeah it could appears to be boundless.

02:18:11,939 --> 02:18:21,920
okay I'm gonna whisper down to Walnut, I

02:18:15,869 --> 02:18:24,989
think my Leakey crucial we free next wow

02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:31,408
that's a lot that's a lot that just came

02:18:24,988 --> 02:18:40,408
out of that mouth uh I look at I look at

02:18:31,408 --> 02:18:42,058
this, and I go isn't it your turn I don't

02:18:40,408 --> 02:18:43,888
know what it I don't know what your God

02:18:42,058 --> 02:18:47,578
is named. I don't either,

02:18:43,888 --> 02:18:50,188
but she says a lot of things sometimes. I

02:18:47,578 --> 02:18:53,549
will, so I will reach out, and see if I

02:18:50,189 --> 02:18:56,429
can know I'm shuttin up into the like

02:18:53,549 --> 02:18:59,038
you enter into the yeah the body of this

02:18:56,429 --> 02:19:00,779
thing yeah well yeah as I as I as I'm

02:18:59,039 --> 02:19:02,309
meditating I'm trying to see whether or

02:19:00,779 --> 02:19:03,510
not the ER will communicate with me

02:19:02,308 --> 02:19:05,638
directly. as it once did.

02:19:03,510 --> 02:19:10,710
yeah absolutely, so you present

02:19:05,638 --> 02:19:14,698
yourself in the cathedral that is this

02:19:10,709 --> 02:19:21,118
entities body, and last time it was full

02:19:14,699 --> 02:19:23,248
of rejoinders and crafty language, dark

02:19:21,119 --> 02:19:27,210
speech, and this time there's nothing

02:19:23,248 --> 02:19:31,529
like that. Your steps echo on these hard

02:19:27,209 --> 02:19:34,618
walls, and there is a chamber, an

02:19:31,529 --> 02:19:37,920
additional chamber that you did not see

02:19:34,619 --> 02:19:42,559
when you were here before, and as you

02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:46,138
approach it you can see plain as day a

02:19:42,558 --> 02:19:50,759
symbol that you know with your Eyes of

02:19:46,138 --> 02:19:55,259
the Runekeeper. The symbol represents

02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:57,630
the person of Oak Truestrike. That is out

02:19:55,260 --> 02:20:01,380
game for this week.

02:19:57,629 --> 02:20:03,179
