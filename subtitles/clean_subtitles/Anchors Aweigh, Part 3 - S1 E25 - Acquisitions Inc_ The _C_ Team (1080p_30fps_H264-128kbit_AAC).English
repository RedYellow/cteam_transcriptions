00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,149
to the left of my left of my left,

00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,429

on the street, it was really weird. yeah

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,620
This is like a fuse Every time I've used

00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:28,340
somebody's real name at this table, you

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:29,930
guys are like it's like this no that's

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,819
too bad she's Nika Harper!

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,010
She's a writer, she's written the hell

the real names of the table it's already

00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:40,370
happening um

00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,829
You're a monster. Well anyway, should I

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,520
should emphasize, before we get started,

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,800
dad I think I think I speak for all of

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,159
us when I say that we missed doing the

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,890
show very much last week and I spent

00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:58,460
Thursday all the time I was not playing

00:02:54,889 --> 00:03:00,769
the game all the time, I was doing labor

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,300
that did not please you. on pleasing

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,870
Labor's

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:08,600
we talked like constantly about it we

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,599
had a cool meet up did in the bar.

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,609
Everyone yelled Hi DM Daddy, and yet made

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,259
a me and I screamed daddy at the top of

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,650
our lungs everyone else started

00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:22,039
screaming down Jerry was there too in a

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:26,150
public place now but there something

00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:28,969
that is sad is that Kate, by which I mean

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,709
Rosie Beestinger, she says that she

00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:33,979
doesn't remember what is going on in the

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:36,830
game under the boathouse no I don't need

00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:38,060
it off-camera talk here foam here what

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,459
do you have behind the curtain

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,979
yeah a lot Where do you want me to start?

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,680
this is this is my novel I

00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:48,469
remember I remember

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,080
there's a there's an angry narrow queen

00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:56,509
on a boat who is lousy with Jim eggs.

00:03:53,080 --> 00:04:02,620
She's on a slide it by one Jim Darkmagic

00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:07,969
that's that's one word anyway so

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,019
sleight-of-hand know when last he feels

00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:12,810
here

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:16,949
When last we saw our heroes, they had

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,139
made an alliance with Team Naiad, a branch

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:24,120
of Acquisitions Incorporated that

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:25,530
operates out of Neverwinter. Now, there

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,329
were issues with the vote, I mean let's

00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:33,809
be honest, the boat is staffed

00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:37,038
crewed by novel individuals. there is

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,329
their decision estaphan Corbin shale

00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,089
then The main thing that we know about

00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:45,508
this gentlemen is that he's mostly warm

00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:49,529
hair. I suggested previously, and I'm

00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:52,379
gonna maintain this concept, that were he

00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:54,719
to shave completely, it would just be a

00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:58,079
human head rolling around on the deck

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,169
with the waves. right hmm

00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,250
Is it a metaphor? I think so. What I we

00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,889
don't know for sure it's a theater the

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:11,339
mic we're doing hair forged hair Forge

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:14,519
it's his hair for in addition their

00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:20,119
Obviator, a new role you have not heard

00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:24,508
of, this this task an Obviator, Fenn,

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,418
made best friends with K'thriss Drow'b.

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:31,770
So she says. Of all people. Well, the offer

00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:35,569
was accepted certainly. She specializes

00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:37,948
in adjusting people's levels of life.

00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:43,019
Creating maximum convenience for her

00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:44,819
party. They are backed up vitally an

00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:49,019
important task their Documancer

00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:51,180
Dol Drama, also down in the basement of

00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,430
the ship I'm just using all the wrong

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,000
words for the boat, trying to get a rise

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,668
out of you.

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,329
Down in the lowest basement part of the

00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:02,519
ship, favorite old down in the bottom of

00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:06,029
the ship belly yeah

00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:08,370
yes this is perfect In addition to

00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:11,519
filing and filling out the most

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:14,038
important documents, she was also, before

00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,139
the rest of the deckhands came on, trying

00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,889
to make repairs to the ship. They've been

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,598
having some problems

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:24,848
they've been having problems getting in

00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:26,378
and out of the harbor recently. They'd

00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:28,538
had their entire boat and crew

00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:31,419
requisitioned by the B Team.

00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:34,329
assholes all I think we can all agree,

00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:35,620
every member of the B team, every current

00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,060
member of the cosmos that they have

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,139
accounted, is an asshole.

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:44,199
Exactly now and cor Michelle had

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,960
suggested that boats -- plural -- were having

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,468
problems. You saw no evidence of that. As

00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:53,799
soon as the boat that you were on

00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:58,468
escaped the harbor, immediately terrors

00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:02,800
from the deep made themselves manifest.

00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:07,449
Rusty you know provisional harpoons at

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,028
best flung up on to the deck, people

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,460
pulled off down into the deep, some of

00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:15,610
them said something strange and hurled themselves

00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:18,818
overboard; that was the situation we

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,729
found ourselves in. Intel Dragonborn

00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:26,919
narcissist Donaar Blit'zen leveraged

00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:29,579
divine power and created a scenario with

00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:35,500
the Command spell that enabled the

00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:40,448
conflict to cease, and someone of rank in

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:43,810
Merrow society to enter into a

00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:46,569
conversation, and what she said was that

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,478
they're clean sought an audience to

00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,939
discuss the matter of your king's

00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:54,938
gruesome treatment of our sovereign

00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:57,399
Queen, and she said something else; she

00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:02,069
also suggested that your king was in

00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:05,550
fact Jim Darkmagic. In addition, she also

00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:08,560
referred to you as _Servants of the Eye_,

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:12,218
and seemed pretty confident in that

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:17,139
assessment. mmm So that is the scene that

00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:22,930
we open ourselves up to. We allow the

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:25,870
narrative to penetrate our course we're

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,879
entering a shared sort of

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,579
narrative space. Wow

00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,970
yeah got any more nice

00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,980
Falls of Medicine ellipsis yeah yeah

00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,460
it's going right a little sinuses woody

00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,590
um

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,660
Would a History check help me understand

00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,280
what Servants of the Eye means? Certainly.

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,389
I know the Jim Darkmagic is you have

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,720
heard of this fellow?

00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:47,970
yeah you uh I can recall a time inside

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,399
the Test Market. yeah when you invoked a

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,519
Mr. Darkmagic. Well we also met him. yeah

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,750
indeed, we have met him, and killed him. so

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,449
But not in that order.

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,649
he's birth two men killed Lisa,

00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,460
transfigured him back from three chicks,

00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:04,919

We in life we gave him death. yeah Mike

We shall make him a king with this queen.

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,520
with cheese speak to one such as myself.

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,340
Are we all on level terms? Alright are

gelatin or something like that I guess

00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:20,009
one of these terms like there are so

00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,629
many different Servants of the Eye, like

00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:23,970
everybody always thinks that they have

00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:26,399
come up with this yeah you can you can

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,680
think if like six different sure six

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,970
different groups of a-holes Now listen I

00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,789

with a roll like a twenty. Oh yeah.

00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,129
Assuming that that's the

00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,350
case,

00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:47,169
yeah I mean you know I mean nothing that

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,600
you can think of directly relating to

00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:51,849
your group, this ship,

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,950
none of those pieces of information line

00:10:51,850 --> 00:11:00,070
up, mmm but 

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,830
you had another concern mr. drab oh just

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,080
that like maybe she thinks that that Jim

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,450
is the the king of this

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,080
entire operation, and we are like his

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,120
knights.

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,170
Which is _not_ the case but how do you

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,539
phrase questions like this? Friend,

00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:18,610
important friend -- there has to be some

00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:22,419
further deference -- she's not friends yes

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,340
Sir are you coming down? Oh yes.

00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:26,769
Are you yelling this from the crow's

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,450
nest? I realize I have a question, then I

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:33,269
say to Fenn,

\kris yeah excuse me one moment

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:37,900
and and I invoke the power of Flight

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:39,879
from and I just and I said my apologies

00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,889
in just a moment and the thing is

00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:45,639
already encircling us yeah around me, and

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:48,699
I just go limp, and it drags me uneasily

00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:52,269
out of the crow's nest, and then sort of,

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,550
like somebody has missed their

00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:55,569
cue, you know this is very

00:11:54,549 --> 00:12:02,829
theatrical

00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:05,170
yeah pardon me for a ways yeah There's a

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,570
there's a period of time where you are

00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:10,899
come just completely just crucified in

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:15,010
reading. So you can-- you're

00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:16,659
welcome to make your entreaty however

00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:21,189
you want to, but it's absolutely vital

00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:23,469
that your human body conform to the body

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,420
that is in the narrative. yes so please

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,000
please continue. but I but if I want to

00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:29,799
see that hunch that twist oh well I

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,570
wouldn't ask it in flight, that seems

00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,029
rude. I did the opportunity to get down

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,480
there and genuflect. I'm not gonna do it

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:39,159
while I'm talking

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,970
that's not that's it you _could_ though I

00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:46,480
could I come from a matriarchal society

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:53,170
I'm gonna do that so I'm going what I

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:56,050
mentioned if I might speak dragon and

00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:58,599
then the tentacle releases me near her

00:12:56,049 --> 00:13:09,099
feet -- or her fin? --  yeah it's right at mine

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:11,259
about and then and I do not get up the

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,050
place is where your metallic objects

00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:19,269
have sparks no you have small fires on

00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:26,679
the ship Rosie's a little too fast

00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:30,310
splayed out face down do you

00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:40,208
Queen of the of the Seas-- 

\priestess I am no Queen.

00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:41,919
\kthriss Oh what are you I'm sorry speak dear for

00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:45,639

00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:48,250
you believe us to be servants of of this

00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,610
sort of a of a symbol or this one and I

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,889
have a the Acquisitions Incorporated

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,399
logo on my first set, right, and I display

00:13:53,889 --> 00:14:01,689
that.

\priestess Perhaps you think me an idiot. I am

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:05,528
perfectly capable of reading your

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:11,560
letters. I can pronounce

00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:14,259
I enjoy 

\dm she actually tree points that

00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,869
the symbol she points it Walnuts

00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:19,600
documents her seal mm-hmm she's like

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,740
\priestess Your letters are not unknown to me.

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,159
they're not relevant

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:31,509
I know poetry could possibly be rendered

00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:35,679
in them but I can make your sounds well.

00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:37,778
\ktrhiss I didn't know that I can read all

\kris I turn

to you guys I can read all letters it

00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:42,189
didn't occur to me for a long time that

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,279
some people cannot read all letters all

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,410
written language

00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:54,720
You found something new about yourself.

00:14:46,409 --> 00:15:02,189

stuff I don't mind

00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:04,359
I'm already on the deck I've done drop

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,759

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,700
this happening you can you can hear that

00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:33,189
what was a pitched battle has now sort

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,440
of been tamped down into something

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,730
approaching diplomacy. But you can tell

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,779
that it's balanced on the edge of a

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:45,190
knife, and it's the sort of thing that

00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:46,539
boldness and wherewithal you know you

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,140
know it says it's a sort of thing that a

00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:54,579
_person of destiny_ would intervene in.

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:57,550
That's all I'm saying. Is there

00:17:54,579 --> 00:18:00,519
a door that I may enter from right now

00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:03,940
the best way you may able the best way

00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:08,410
you're able to make your way on was into

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,930
a into a crate by the main mast. oh so

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,970
I'm like I am in a pot going I am I am

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,830
okay fantastic.

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,640
Do I have to strength check to just bust

00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:24,879
out of that beast?

00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:35,290
absolutely vital electronic thank you to

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:44,080
my dandy group for buying sturdy so this

00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:45,940
conversation from a crate on the deck

00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,230
I'm starting to rock it back and forth

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,299
now to just feel like something's

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,250
product if it's begun to shimmy but you

00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:52,930
shimmy it to the point where no you're

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,640
against the mast and you can't go here

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,640
or in that direction I'm just concerned

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,269
okay Rosie walks over to it and kind of

00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,949
watches it. As you guys you're moving

00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:06,349
over like the marrow on the deck just

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,850
are like there's no reaction yet but

00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:10,429
they are making sure that they are

00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:13,039
containing everything about this yeah I

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,690
make eye contact with them too yes as I

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,430
walk toward the box like yeah we're both

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,100
watching each other didn't you watching

00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,810
me watch some Jewish guys yep and I'm

00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:27,079
gonna study this box. I'm gonna toss the

00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:30,529
look back to Walnut all right Oh weird

00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:32,659
yeah I'd like to try to pry the lid off

00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:43,210
the crate with a semi master without

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:46,250
doing a strike on ya at the monastery

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,600
you know they had this crate so they

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,160
couldn't get open they're like I need

00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,819
some kind of rod or something

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,310
like that God's pickle truck exactly

00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:58,399
fifteen thirteen thirteen is okay you

00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:01,250
whack

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,790
the side of the crate and you're able to

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:09,559
pop up one corner of the lid of the land

00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:11,420
indeed okay in my confusion I hear

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,039
something attacking the other side of

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,640
the box and it flips backwards right

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:22,099
because I'm just like oh my god so it's

00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:24,080
spilling out unceremoniously, is a what

00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:26,539
you would consider tall -- but currently in

00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:31,339
its prone form it is _long_ --

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:33,490
a golden-scaled lizardfolk and wearing

00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:38,720
these strange vaporous robes, and

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:41,509
traveling finery, and next to her is a a

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,870
battle axe, which looks brittle and made

00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:47,539
of ancient bones. She stumbles to her

00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:50,000
feet, and then very proudly takes her

00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:54,799
time, brandishes her weapon, looks around

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,210
at everyone, says,

\kiupid Halt in the ship in the

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,950
name of the Blit'zen accord!

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,629
[Music]

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:10,379
and she looks around she kind of

00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:14,248
reserves all eyes turn on Donaar she

00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:21,378
freezes she checks her bucks for a

00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:23,548
minute

for you to know my name. I am the chosen

00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,138

\nika and then she gives herself a self

00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:06,778
high five.

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:30,538
impressive digitation sparks come out

00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:34,710
like these people were queens you fish

00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:37,878

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,879
different in this realm aren't they

00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:54,839
marrow are moving across the deck

00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:58,858

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,539

00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:46,959

00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:01,000
of the past the front of the boat past

00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:05,099
the priestess. Oh boy because you can see

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,650

it's like he's on this paladin holy

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:26,109
quest thing. I think he thinks stealing

00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:28,599
is wrong, but I don't know how long he'll

00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:30,399
feel that way. So um do you know what it

00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,069
could just be the business we'll take

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,769
care of it. But uh if he doesn't return

00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,129
it it's on is that how it works yeah for

00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,839
sure

00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,300
All right though man so good my friend

I'm waiting for this pearl trip because

00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:02,829
Pearl Jam's on it. So after after a

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:06,519
minute or so passes, you were beginning

00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:08,329
to find it difficult to breathe. hmm

00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:10,259
It's gillyweed.

00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:27,059
Rosie, what do you do like should have

00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:29,940
asked first so that the priestess is

00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:33,569
looking at this bizarre family reunion,

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:38,190
isn't shaking her head she's like,

\priestess It's

00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:40,500
no matter. This will all come out fish

00:25:38,190 --> 00:26:24,480
men are definitely trying to give you

00:25:40,500 --> 00:26:29,880
this yeah very each they are each taking

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:32,370
in arm not not gently but not you know

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,280
not taking it for their own it's not

00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:36,659
like WWE you know what I mean, but they

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,009
definitely are they gonna push us in the

00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,900
water. It's time for you to come so with

00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:44,940
my last breath I swing off my dock and

00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,430
then oh look at all of my sweet, sweet,

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,910
not-waterproof paper and I look at this

00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,170
and I just enter your personal space

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,970
open up your whole horse person bag and

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:58,519
just show my Documancy bag in it, and

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,519
I close it and I grab you and I go yeah

00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:07,049
so it's like it'll end I think it starts

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,320
with the corner it's like it's able to

00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:12,960
slurp up a couple of scraps like like

00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,329
pasta and then it has to work much

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,190
harder for the bulk of the bag but

00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,879
you're helping it along oh like yes

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,700
she's got her foot in it

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:26,710
see the motion foot I'm wearing the bag

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,029
I'm like well as like punished it takes

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,690
that for mother and uses the hills of

00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:35,170
Italy - right

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,880
it's eventually able to get around it and

00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,259
then twist itself closed a little bit

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,940
and we're thinking about cheek for two

00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:43,269
weeks all of my papers getting turn to

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,799
mush so yeah yeah Rosie, as we're getting

00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:46,299
pulled off the ship, is trying

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,829
desperately to give you tips on swimming,

00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,309
because she knows that you don't know

00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:51,309
how.

00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:52,299
and so like it'll be fine because we can

00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,359
breathe underwater it's gonna be alright

00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:57,579
but she's she's like just do a lot of

00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:10,809
kicking. Kick with your legs, don't worry

00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:13,059
so much she's hearing so the the marrow

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:15,669
are able to cut straight through the

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:21,639
water and you can out in front of them

00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:23,890
is this this leader figure that was up

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,710
on the on the bow of the boat. The front.

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,940
The bow. Front if you no no I got it the

00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:32,890
boat tip the nose

00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:36,250
yeah the tip yeah it's one of the two

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:38,650
same four different art it's one of the

00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,079
tube and then the deeper you get down

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,120
there is a it's almost like and you can

00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:46,269
look at a glass and that the water and

00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,909
oil separate, it sits like that here but

00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:51,639
for light. it's there's you pass through

00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:53,590
a period of darkness, where your senses

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,530
aren't able to perceive anything, and

00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:59,319
then once you penetrate that,

00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,859
the lowest part of that it's nothing

00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,559
like that

00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:06,750
it's perfectly you you're in a place of

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:13,919
perfect visibility. Beautiful, clear water,

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:16,900
and you can see all manner of a radical

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,220
reconfiguration of how a city would work

00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,620
mm-hmm

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:24,990
you can see platforms

00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:29,199
suspended and tied from trunks of kelp.

00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:32,490
You can see in the distance as you're

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,490
passing through small

00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:42,710
you assume that their houses crafted in

00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:45,769
concert with coral and in the distance

00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,539
you can see what looks like the the

00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:51,829
superstructure of it appears to be made

00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:55,220
of massive boat holes that's a good boat

00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:58,369
word right but they're all held in place

00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:02,259
and then filled all around the rest of

00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:06,500
it we again in concert with this shaped

00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:08,420
coral but it's it is not it isn't it

00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,589
isn't just like cement or something, it

00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,350
isn't just like a different type of

00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:17,000
joinery; this is a living

00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:22,459
reef that these marrow also dwell in as

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,710
well. I'm trying to tabletalk him trying

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,079
to give you the best starwars experience

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,539
I can picture it's like dark Little

00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,339
Mermaid. That's right. we've been over

00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:34,970
this you know I made this note original

00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:39,589
loop yeah exactly so you are

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:44,360
taken down into the great doors of this

00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:46,459
hall and you can see that there's not

00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:50,539
stairs of the classic sense -- they don't

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:52,190
require that -- but there are tunnels that

00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:54,829
they travel through. So their tunnels

00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,808
don't need to be as tall, right they just

00:30:54,829 --> 00:31:00,259
pass it as you're being drawn through

00:30:56,808 --> 00:31:02,029
here you can see various types of armor

00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,900
tridents like you're moving into a place

00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:11,440
that is heavily policed, and you are

00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:17,210
taken not to a royal chamber,

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:20,150
but to something adjacent to it, and the

00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:24,220
the priestess brings you in and says,

\priestess you

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:29,330
could never you could never enter the

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:36,679
Royal chamber of our queen garb like

00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:39,009
this makeover this what is it he looks

00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,100
great late armor I'm just like

00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:44,349
like a stone bedraggled yeah absolutely

00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:47,859
I did what ever it is about this pearl

00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:50,469
is allowing you to okay to conceive of

00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:52,449
language here but you also of course

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,690
have your your mental capacity to

00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:58,840
communicate as well that's true so you

00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,620
can see you can see just in this in this

00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:05,679
space

00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:08,469
there's garb of various kinds for bipeds

00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,910
hmm this is this is if this is not the

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,610
first time they've had visitors

00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:14,500
apparently that's nice what's this

00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:16,059
what's it look like when the

00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,859
understanding that Christmas is probably

00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:21,159
already disrobed

00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:24,129
oh yes 100%

00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,930
yeah 100% they have all kinds of

00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,230
stitched-- it's almost like the kelp is

00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:32,710
used in place of a textile. So there are

00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,960
pouches and bags to keep your things, and

00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:38,590
there's also food here. There's some

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:42,579
something that looks like an apple, but

00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:45,699
they're sort of suspended from sheets of

00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:57,819
seaweed. mmm There's also fish, all the

00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:59,650
classic water foods. A cute kid lets out

00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:05,919

intended pieces of clothing it is a

00:37:49,190 --> 00:38:01,309

00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:05,119
virile who certainly probably was before

00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:12,349
I met him the king that different

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:14,539

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,559
within me

00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:41,329
I feel like it's better to not show him

00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:43,220
the best King what yeah no it's fine the

00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:44,900

back on ideally one day oh that's a good

00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:53,960
question will they permit us to wear in

00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,909
other words RAC is at the mercy of

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,070
whatever this kelp provides yeah I can't

00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:59,750

kelp also I just realized

00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:09,710
mushrooms breathe underwater what's

00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:11,450

00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:36,019
[Laughter]

00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:42,559

eyes garbs yet it's fine but it's it's

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,449
like um it's a almost a parody of what

00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,550

00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:48,199
halter top bikini that she's made she's

00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:53,019
like the dress just yeah I want to find

00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:55,399
like a bathrobe of kelp just like a

00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:58,969
bathrobe tied and the in the middle

00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,769

from magazine-style um when in reef

00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,380
business I wall that's where I had at

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:24,110
least five pieces of clothes she is

00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:26,300
still covered from yeah let me also add

00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:28,760
that because we're underwater like this

00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,600
loincloth might I mean it'll work where

00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,610
there's gravity

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,159
yeah and air is that the practice too

00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,570
much but here it is not doing it's very

00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:37,460
much just like a limbic depending on the

00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:39,440
angle it's the same as not having it

00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:43,809
exactly exactly it looks like it could

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,809
be like a cummerbund or the loincloth

00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:52,390
torso decor napkin right so really make

00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:56,379
sure to always stand in your interview

00:43:52,389 --> 00:44:01,909
we're ready so stream three marrow

00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:05,829
materialized in this in this place and

00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:08,690
then lead you back through this tunnel

00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:11,900
you're able to hold onto various points

00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:15,200
of their Trident and you're sort of

00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:21,349
pulled through this space and when you

00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:23,599
enter into the the throne chamber mhm

00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:26,329
as I said I said before you could tell

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:31,579
from the outside but in here is it's not

00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:33,730
it's not decor it isn't like a like an

00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:37,400
interior design choice this is a

00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:40,670
completely functional reef mmm that so

00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:45,309
fish schools of fish are moving on

00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:49,070
harried there's curious eels poking out

00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:53,329
to see what new what new sites Bugatti

00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:55,970
is very curious about brethren there's

00:44:53,329 --> 00:45:03,559
lots there are lots there's no shortage

00:44:55,969 --> 00:45:06,769
of strange undersea friends for the

00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:14,809
ngati down here but you are brought up

00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:17,869
to up to an empty throne chamber behind

00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:21,529
which there is a curtain of six scales

00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:23,509
and kelp iridescent scales and then

00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:26,480
there's a much something happens that

00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:30,860
you can't sense whatever it is you don't

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:33,199
have the organ required to know when you

00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:37,309
should be operating at maximum deference

00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:39,919
down here they perceive some signal and

00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:44,599
they immediately bow toward this empty

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:47,690
throne mm-hmm as soon as I noticed I do

00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:49,969
but I can't yeah I bow does yeah look

00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:53,019
around like oh yeah I'm watching him

00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:53,019
yeah waiting for him to go

00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:06,679
then I get taller

00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:07,910
I think it'll hit you're trying you're

00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,248
trying to lay down but you're a couple

00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:12,618
inches up and you just kind of doing

00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:17,169
your best there's some strange current

00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:20,900
in here and then you can see that these

00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:24,470
these gleaming scales and the kelp sort

00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,960
of like rise up with the entrance of

00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:30,788
this queen but they have called Sundra

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:34,970
frill you have overheard this oh my god

00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:37,210
you have overheard this many times as

00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:40,879
you were as you were preparing yourself

00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:42,980
and then you can see that the the kelp

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,950
and the scales just sort of like they

00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:51,440
rise up and they drape themselves over

00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:56,960
what looks to be a maybe 15 foot long

00:46:51,440 --> 00:47:00,470
salmon that fully salmon that's no ace

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:03,559
salmon it's just a fish just a fish it's

00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:06,980
a to half mermaid not two tails you know

00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,858
surface world is another place that

00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,780
could gouge it or the mention of the

00:49:50,858 --> 00:49:55,659
surface world she looks over at the

00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:58,990
court the court note just just as the

00:49:55,659 --> 00:50:02,649
guess the curious eels had begun this

00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:05,858
place is now rapidly filling with every

00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:08,380
tear of marrow society there's a lot of

00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:10,269
curiosity about this and the mention of

00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:14,050
this surface world as a place one could

00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:16,599
possibly be married she turns her chin

00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:20,440
over to over to one of the factions you

00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:22,420
know that is a materialized here, and she

00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,639
doesn't have to say anything. Like, that's

00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,460
just ridiculous on the face of it. You

00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:31,929
can tell that whatever a salmon counts

00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:38,349
as a smile is now occurring. I do the

00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:40,149
same. Well, it sounds like you've got

00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:42,760
yourself a pretty good situation. You're

00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:45,760
a queen, he's a king, things are good. yeah

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,569
What could we had an arrangement. What

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:54,160
was it? We would protect his vessels. okay

00:50:49,568 --> 00:51:02,980
mm-hmm as he maintained our pact, which

00:50:54,159 --> 00:51:05,618
was seven nights each year oh that's not

00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:08,588
for you to know. okay yeah I think so. are

00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:11,970
we gonna be at Donaar again no I'm gonna

00:51:08,588 --> 00:51:15,548
be here for it very gonna be like

00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:17,500
dissociation all over the place. So when

00:51:15,548 --> 00:51:22,000
was the last time you saw Jim Darkmagic?

00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:26,980
A year ago and he's due quite for

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,079
his week. hmm well so you will

00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:32,349
communicate this to him.

00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:35,619
in any way I see fit

00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:39,699
hmm and in exchange, your people will

00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:42,519
stop attacking our boats. This depends

00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:46,779
upon the actions of the king. Of course.

00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:52,570
There are many ways to communicate this

00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:56,410
to him mm-hmm from our perspective. My

00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:59,440
feeling -- and I suspect the court will

00:51:56,409 --> 00:52:03,969
agree -- is that when your bodies wash up

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:08,230
into the harbor of Neverwinter, our

00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:11,529
communicate course though it may be will

00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:14,769
arrive hmm Well, we actually have a

00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:21,210
direct line to your husband's um is that

00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:24,280
so that is so great, great Queen, our

00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:28,840
murders and subsequent beaching would

00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:30,250
indeed be an effective method and as I

00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,190
pause a little too long for anybody's

00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:38,590
facing your eyes wander yeah you're

00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:41,950
thinking like should I continue?? you but

00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:45,100
there is another way. In fact, it may even

00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:48,519
return response for you right now.

00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:52,750
I have there you hear a few Morden

00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:54,099
chuckles from the court and they don't

00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:57,730
sound like maro

00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:59,980
you've heard. that hmm if this crowd is

00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:03,550
very large now, it could hide any manner

00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:05,380
of of participant in this court. we would

00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:08,260
give an air-breathing

00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,860

to get him down here, that's not what's

00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,490
currently happening? Oh, deception, that's

00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:58,949
a good idea.

00:55:56,489 --> 00:56:01,379
Are we doing this by listless

00:55:58,949 --> 00:56:04,919
communities at um I'm not saying in

00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:07,019
front of the fish. no I think this chance

00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,579
of Mr. Darkmagic coming down here for

00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:12,539
what's actually happening is probably

00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:13,199
zero. Um maybe we could tell him what

00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:16,289
does he like?

00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:18,449
he likes spells, he likes he likes being

00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,489
adored. I think he also likes not dying

00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:24,529
of the direction sickness he's dying

00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:24,529

very obvious that you were casting a

00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,969
spell in the middle of this in this

00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:59,699
place and so these these tridents are

00:58:56,969 --> 00:59:02,819
leveled and you are you maintain your

00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:06,210
concentration and send it, and then about

00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:10,109
30 seconds pass and you receive a

00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:13,019
Sending back. It says miss afraid of the

00:59:10,108 --> 00:59:16,858

way.

00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:24,509
[Laughter]

00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:28,858
Queensland right Queensland referral

00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:35,700

00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:53,039
royalty, it's super cool to meet you and

00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:55,108
everything. I also know a lot about like

00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,420
people who don't come back, like when

00:59:55,108 --> 01:00:00,059
maybe when it's part of a prophecy, or

00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:01,889
like they're supposed to, or like stuff

01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:03,809
is happening and shits going down and

01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:06,239
you're just you know weirdly alone.

01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:07,559
I totally get you on this like who who

01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:09,029
is who is this King that we're supposed

01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:11,460
to get? I bet for us it's gonna be like

01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:16,250
super easy. It's a shame that you won't

01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:16,250
live long enough to learn to speak well

01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:28,080
she filled cheese casts a great gaze

01:00:24,809 --> 01:00:32,099
from a giant fishy I hmm

01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:35,090
left and right there's some twitch that

01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:39,710
she is able that she was able to commit

01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:43,680
and immediately try dance our level ah

01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:45,150
and there's a voice, a voice that you

01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:48,480
recognize.

01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:52,740
Walnut, you can see a

01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:55,650
shape sort of emerge from a group and

01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:58,319
sort of it comes out into the center of

01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:59,220
this area, into the audience chamber

01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,340
itself.

01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:07,409
Flanked by two young women in black

01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:11,940
robes, you see mendes veil who spoke to

01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:16,289
you atop the cart after

01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:17,869
Nemazir and the queen says,

\queen Worldwright

01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:22,139
veiled,

01:01:17,869 --> 01:01:23,000
what do you have to say

01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,319
on this matter?

01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,760
It's like she doesn't want to

01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,530
assume that all surfaced Villiers know

01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:33,180
each other, you know what I mean? But she

01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:37,670
really want to be that person he

01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:42,000
says,
\veil I cannot abide the insult that

01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:43,858
these people have committed to you and I

01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,150
cannot abide the insult of Jim Dark

01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:51,569
against your royalty he says but

01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:54,780
they are my prey and I would kill them

01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:57,480
myself and you have my you have my

01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:00,060
guarantee in this matter I am aggrieved

01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,769
by their behavior but there is no reason

01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:03,578
to muddled the water of this court with

01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:06,800
their blood

01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:08,539
yeah we're the worst I look at

01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,269
Catherine's real quick because he

01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:15,409
doesn't know who they're and I I went to

01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:19,219
one of the the women I go sisters of may

01:02:15,409 --> 01:02:22,068
Lilith so you can you can tell right

01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:25,098
away you can you can feel underneath the

01:02:22,068 --> 01:02:29,420
underneath the waves you can feel the

01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:32,030
natural forces that bind these chunks of

01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:35,269
the altars together you can feel a sort

01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:37,519
of rising and reaching behind you but

01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:39,530
this is occurring behind you so it's

01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,818
actually pulling it against your throat

01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:44,420
mmm

01:02:40,818 --> 01:02:47,838
here in the deep if you turn to see him

01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:51,769
you can see that he wears on a chain a

01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:55,818
chunk of black altar and his his focus

01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:58,460
has two symbols on it one of May 8th and

01:02:55,818 --> 01:03:01,750
another one of these another one of

01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:04,789
these icons that has brought you such

01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:07,088
torment mmm because it's not language

01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:09,619
just like the ER it can't be translated

01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:12,409
it can be understood it can only be

01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:13,700
consumed - am I able to see it at this

01:03:12,409 --> 01:03:16,279
distance where I can just tell that I

01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:17,539
can't you used you just know you just

01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,569
you know that it's something that you

01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:24,039
need to have mmm

01:03:20,568 --> 01:03:27,548
and the Queen says how will you do this

01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:31,099
tell me how you will do it and he says

01:03:27,548 --> 01:03:32,780
when they least expect it my lady I will

01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:36,530
kill each of them in a place that they

01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:39,619
believe is a place of safety I'll save

01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:40,900
one for whom I have reserved a fate

01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:44,890
worse than death

01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:48,680
hmm baby dying right now

01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:49,759
take it grandpa what if you've gotten

01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:53,149
yourself into

01:03:49,760 --> 01:04:01,130
it's like it she says like what Tuesday

01:03:53,150 --> 01:04:03,260
kid um so so so she nods she nods from

01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:06,910
her perch this is onions dragons you can

01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:10,910
tell you want no yes this is too much

01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:12,378
now you've lost me everything until a

01:04:10,909 --> 01:04:18,989
fish not again

01:04:12,378 --> 01:04:22,618
so I look at manners doesn't as well and

01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:25,679
I see that he has a focus on he does and

01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:27,509
he does that symbol that you know was a

01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,039
symbol of terror and hatred but has now

01:04:27,509 --> 01:04:31,938
been completely reconfigured in your

01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:35,278
eyes now that I know that the myth was

01:04:31,938 --> 01:04:43,068
taken away and not of the traitor not

01:04:35,278 --> 01:04:47,608
her fault I look at him and I go I say

01:04:43,068 --> 01:04:53,398
you wear me a little mark I say that did

01:04:47,608 --> 01:04:55,938
we serve her and I say and we'll just

01:04:53,398 --> 01:05:00,298
tries real hard and it's very difficult

01:04:55,938 --> 01:05:03,748
cuz she goes she goes she goes in a way

01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:07,498
I served me with two he his head

01:05:03,748 --> 01:05:10,528
and I go I saw her in a vision I say I

01:05:07,498 --> 01:05:13,618
saw them both he does not like that

01:05:10,528 --> 01:05:17,849
that's fine and I said I say I saw what

01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:20,369
truly happened to her I go and I say and

01:05:17,849 --> 01:05:23,399
I I kind of look at this I I convey to

01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:30,119
him I invade his mind and I say she

01:05:23,398 --> 01:05:34,168
chose me as her vessel yes and I say I

01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:38,068
say and I say I say help us we're here

01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:39,929
we're here to to help mail it we're here

01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:42,929
to find her and set her free.

01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:53,749
yeah he says, we could not possibly serve

01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:53,749
the same Maelith. Is it a common name and

01:05:54,559 --> 01:06:05,819
then I go I go, It's possible that what

01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:09,059
you know is not Maelith. and I say but um

01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:14,909
I say well, I don't know they got the

01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:19,109
same symbol yeah oh my god well no well

01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:21,929
yeah I don't I don't know who you think

01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:23,789
you're serving, but if you don't think

01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:27,400
it's the same person, then

01:06:23,789 --> 01:06:29,829
you shouldn't be wearing that symbol, and

01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:33,180
you shouldn't be saying her name, because

01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:33,179
you don't know about her whole thing. I

01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:40,358
[Music]

01:06:35,849 --> 01:06:45,580
say to him, It's a lazy solution to the

01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:47,949
problem. You now have he's he says name

01:06:45,579 --> 01:06:50,500
three Maelith albums yeah exactly it's

01:06:47,949 --> 01:06:54,608
like we were first

01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:58,929
what's your Maelith them he says he

01:06:54,608 --> 01:07:02,079
says, As I suggested, we'll be seeing each

01:06:58,929 --> 01:07:04,829
other soon enough. We may have a moment

01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,829
to discuss it then.

01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:13,150
Real quick, before you go, who was the one

01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:16,480
you're gonna kill? last death but not

01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:19,470
death right? Was it my death?

01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:22,210
yeah death death right is it me?

01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:24,159
it's okay we can just go home. One does a

01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:26,079
hand gesture could just go you've never

01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:29,108
seen before but is like a hundred

01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,219
percent no flippin the bird but it her

01:07:29,108 --> 01:07:40,690
gross version yes exactly it's it's the

01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:47,409
it's the EPA version that's so like

01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:53,409
anger yes so the Queen seems satisfied

01:07:47,409 --> 01:07:59,199
with this solution. Great All right you

01:07:53,409 --> 01:08:03,670
you are gripped just as before something

01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:05,439
like a fishnet woven out of kelp that

01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:09,190
includes any of the pieces that you

01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:13,630
might have removed any of the naked K'thriss

01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:14,588
clothes are sequestered in there

01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,469
they don't what they kind of trashed

01:08:14,588 --> 01:08:18,729
down here mm-hmm

01:08:16,469 --> 01:08:20,469
and they they drag you up and you can

01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:23,879
sort of see like their sky is completely

01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:28,180
dark. It's just this dark layer of water

01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:31,810
above their city and the club once you

01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:34,838
once you pierce that you get back up all

01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:36,679
the way to the top and you can see Dol Drama

01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:41,208
fell

01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:45,828
Finn, and Corbin shale just like, looking

01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:49,309
worriedly over the edge of the ship. So

01:08:45,828 --> 01:08:52,399
just to be very clear, Queen Sundra

01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:54,769
thrill said we have to contact Jim and

01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,719
she was gonna kill us to do it and then

01:08:54,769 --> 01:08:58,400
Mendes Veil showed up and said, I will

01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,469
contact Jim and also these are mine to

01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,568
kill. Exactly mine okay I will do your

01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:06,408
quest and don't kill these fools right

01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:08,329
okay yeah but they're pals again, so we

01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:11,748
got off pretty easy cuz I got the vibe

01:09:08,328 --> 01:09:13,938
he was gonna kill us anyway. So like, net

01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:17,208
positive. it's a win it's a win chalk

01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:21,559

optimist everyone here. So they're

01:09:21,559 --> 01:09:27,048
immediately like Dol Drama sees you

01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:30,439

I'm always sad to see him arrive and I'm

01:10:20,779 --> 01:10:29,319
always a little sad so Corbin she'll

01:10:24,769 --> 01:10:34,099
says are they but he coming back

01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:36,938
not for us your boat your ship it's not

01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:40,639
gonna be protected anymore apparently

01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:43,309
Mr. Jim Darkmagic had a pact with the

01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:46,219
fish Queen to protect he said that he

01:10:43,309 --> 01:10:48,349
handled this well and then he didn't

01:10:46,219 --> 01:10:51,380
because he's apparently dying of some

01:10:48,349 --> 01:10:52,639
great robbing disease. I don't know he

01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,788
said that he had negotiated an

01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:58,429
incredible deal. Well, he didn't. he did

01:10:55,788 --> 01:11:00,679
Well he did, but he is not fulfilling his

01:10:58,429 --> 01:11:04,038
side of the deal. side of it it's just

01:11:00,679 --> 01:11:11,599
supposed to do bang a fish, okay?

01:11:04,038 --> 01:11:13,609
I mean 790 years with the fish Queen oh

01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:14,929
well that's I mean that's that certainly

01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:17,779
has to be considered a win.

01:11:14,929 --> 01:11:23,208
See, that's what I was thinking I

01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:25,188
absolutely have like if you if you said

01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:31,670
that you're gonna come back you know you

01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:33,769
should worry what you weren't ever books

01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:35,510
that you're supposed to you know like

01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:37,309
come back that's that's a that's a

01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:38,659
difference of the deal where we show

01:11:37,309 --> 01:11:40,729
says I thought I understood the

01:11:38,658 --> 01:11:42,529
conversation we were having, but then it

01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:46,880
seems like there's a different there's a

01:11:42,529 --> 01:11:50,328
lot going on okay wait but I think that

01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:52,090
I don't know Walnut illicit older I'm I

01:11:50,328 --> 01:12:01,368
guess I think we can solve this problem

01:11:52,090 --> 01:12:03,479
with documents a filling out forms like

01:12:01,368 --> 01:12:05,458
like lanes

01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:07,619
and they like have it pulls out and it's

01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:09,420
just like it's like red ink

01:12:07,618 --> 01:12:11,308
it's like Xing stuff out and then it's

01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,158
like a fender and it's like gym dark

01:12:11,309 --> 01:12:15,958
magic and ratting him out Rosie there's

01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:20,368
like Rosie bringing you fresh ink pots

01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:21,868
and like wiping your brow they're

01:12:20,368 --> 01:12:25,649
like catching squid yeah it's like

01:12:21,868 --> 01:12:26,908
removing the ink squeezing it out can

01:12:25,649 --> 01:12:28,589
actually make a little quill out of the

01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:33,328
bone inside of squid talk about on Table

01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:36,869
Talk anyway yeah so yeah a it's a team

01:12:33,328 --> 01:12:39,149
and files documents saying that there's

01:12:36,868 --> 01:12:41,368
trucks and that with the Jim Darkmagic

01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:44,248
the whole thing and then Team C does the

01:12:41,368 --> 01:12:46,380
whole thing and then we can deliver a

01:12:44,248 --> 01:12:49,139
mail by just shoving them in purses bag

01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,248
sounds true I walk over to him and told

01:12:49,139 --> 01:12:52,349

01:12:50,248 --> 01:12:56,010
them too I go to confession I go okay

01:12:52,349 --> 01:12:57,538
ready I'm stressing that mouth oh well

01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:01,880
that's a monster just like tomato juice

01:12:57,538 --> 01:13:01,880
where I'm like put things in the mailbox

01:13:03,229 --> 01:13:06,599
best part is that cuz Chris doesn't care

01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:13,800
at all he's like yes that's the right

01:13:06,599 --> 01:13:26,699
way to do it each one I go I go you can

01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:29,279
put one in this documents why is nobody

01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:32,248
why don't we have this this is a new

01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:33,748

01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:49,558
like the subheadings all the

01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,449

01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:56,219
quickly vamping BAM

yeah yeah yeah this there's there's a

01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:58,708

whole very specific sub channel of

01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:09,498
Showtime

01:14:06,729 --> 01:14:11,808

01:14:09,498 --> 01:14:13,639
absolutely going back she should you

01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:15,199

no you're going to cost us all right you

01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:21,408
weird dreams cross across to the right

01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:23,210
pretty we continue we continue our way

01:14:21,408 --> 01:14:28,248
while you guys are doing this Rosie

01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:30,769
saying cool ship stuff like Oh trim the

01:14:28,248 --> 01:14:33,288
main that's one thing that she says and

01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:35,809
it's not one of many yeah person Rosie

01:14:33,288 --> 01:14:37,698

been doing this we've been doing that

01:14:44,868 --> 01:14:50,479
history yeah yeah yeah for cartography

01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:53,300
and that's what we use it for we do we

01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:54,198
do oh that's an eighth though she didn't

01:14:53,300 --> 01:15:05,059

ship exactly it's not your face but it's

01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:17,498
not it's not it's odd I mean you had to

01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:19,340
sort of reverse engineer this right this

01:15:17,498 --> 01:15:21,139
scenario you're trying to navigate to

01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,998
something that is not on a map right you

01:15:21,139 --> 01:15:24,800
found with the help of birds and with a

01:15:22,998 --> 01:15:27,920
boat that it's kind of a piece of crap

01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,849
let's say beyond this hey hey hey it's

01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,389
seen better days

01:15:28,849 --> 01:15:43,578
well after lingerie to Victoria's Secret

01:15:32,389 --> 01:15:45,230
Merry Widow you know what tables that's

01:15:43,578 --> 01:15:46,988
where all of her points are and like

01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:49,368
before

01:15:46,988 --> 01:15:53,328

01:15:49,368 --> 01:15:55,819

see a white house say goin okay the

01:15:55,819 --> 01:16:06,198
daytime Rosie's definitely the kind of

01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:07,848
person know who when she gets her bad

01:16:06,198 --> 01:16:11,058
history check on her cartography Zeng

01:16:07,849 --> 01:16:12,800
she will blame the boat oh yeah but only

01:16:11,059 --> 01:16:14,779
the boats fault actually well yeah

01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,850
because it's sort of like nose listing

01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:18,069
or something listings

01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:20,020
then listing since we saw it every time

01:16:18,069 --> 01:16:21,819
I'm like it's listing again and lazily

01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:25,720
to the left that's right exactly

01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:28,269
 and listen yeah it's

01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:31,090
not really pop this word I bring the

01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:32,650
battle-ax over to him he just really

01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:34,600
wants to catch up and I just like kind

01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:36,129
of push it into like his chest and walk

01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:38,260
away I'm like looking second ice

01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:39,460
orDonaarily this is the top part of the

01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,860
head and the lower part of the head sort

01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:45,730
of form that ax shape but then just

01:16:41,859 --> 01:16:47,259
snaps closed and he's just he's just

01:16:45,729 --> 01:16:49,989
he's ready he's ready to interact with

01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:52,539
you III I say I didn't get a chance to

01:16:49,989 --> 01:17:06,699
tell you down there but if it weren't

01:16:52,539 --> 01:17:09,010
for those pearls that they fed us you

01:17:06,699 --> 01:17:11,019
think it's a smile you don't know I mean

01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:14,250
you don't know what is happening with

01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:14,250
this for so long

01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:21,069
are you hungry thirsty what is this

01:17:18,699 --> 01:17:25,109
emotion I can't I can't read it

01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:28,989
yeah so I says well how have you been

01:17:25,109 --> 01:17:32,649
I've been busy but not as much time as

01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:34,510
passed here in in this realm I still

01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:36,099
don't quite understand the the nature of

01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:38,470
the shadow realm time the incredibly

01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:42,220
curious well let me tell you what's

01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:45,640
what's happened to me the entire

01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:48,190
dragon's hoard was dismantled by

01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:52,840
usurpers hmm

01:17:48,189 --> 01:17:56,829
I was killed several times I'm knowing

01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:59,829
nod yes that he took the central column

01:17:56,829 --> 01:18:03,550
where the King lived and its shadow

01:17:59,829 --> 01:18:08,399
portal and built a kind of temple around

01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:11,260
it hmm and I found once I regained life

01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:14,799
that I could crawl into the shadow

01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:18,060
portal and for some reason they believed

01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:22,300
everything I said about everything I

01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:24,930
don't I have a trusting face I don't

01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,930
know what it is

01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:35,320
I can see that is that I I told them all

01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:38,650
kinds of stories and they started

01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:41,799
writing them down and for whatever

01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:44,500
reason they oriented their entire

01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:48,880
society around it hmm

01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:51,729
but long story short I'm back we can

01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,510
hang out this is great I meant to come

01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:55,089

01:19:39,699 --> 01:19:46,630

01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:44,469
stories that might have been

01:22:42,698 --> 01:22:48,719
mythological tales of what might happen

01:22:44,469 --> 01:22:48,719

01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:16,299
manners and things that you do it's like

01:23:13,899 --> 01:23:18,819
okay so on your first dinner with new

01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:21,449
friends or acquaintances you have the

01:23:18,819 --> 01:23:29,738
ceremonial eggy which you cook and split

01:23:21,448 --> 01:23:31,538
among the group nothing to do with

01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:36,908
anything but like there is an idea and

01:23:31,538 --> 01:23:38,228
it's like kind of like this ritual like

01:23:36,908 --> 01:23:39,488
a gesture of friendship where it's like

01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:41,469
if you meet a new friend or if you find

01:23:39,488 --> 01:23:45,668
an egg on the way then like part of it

01:23:41,469 --> 01:23:48,038
is you keep the eggs you get rid of them

01:23:45,668 --> 01:23:49,719
in some like beautiful kind of fashion

01:23:48,038 --> 01:23:52,059
like giving it away to someone else or

01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:55,779
eating it when you greet each other yeah

01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:58,059
yes three you keep it for a while but

01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:58,328

01:23:58,059 --> 01:24:00,579
world

01:23:58,328 --> 01:24:05,768

01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:41,659
this now from the from atop the crow's

01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:43,130
nest because the MainTop house was

01:28:41,658 --> 01:28:44,689
actually called crows nests are actually

01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:46,069
only on whaling ships so if this is a

01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:51,738
whaling ship then yes it's crow's nest

01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:53,539
yes in his whale tango anyway she she

01:28:51,738 --> 01:28:56,069
seized you

01:28:53,539 --> 01:28:59,819
approaching the edge and looking over

01:28:56,069 --> 01:29:02,489
and she fences I don't like it I don't

01:28:59,819 --> 01:29:05,210
like it and you know exactly what she

01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:07,679
means because this is not the glint of

01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:10,500
orDonaary this is not just like the Sun

01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:11,750
dappled glint you can see floating in

01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:18,029
the water

01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:21,029
hundreds of lockets oh geez that's cool

01:29:18,029 --> 01:29:23,399
huh huh oh boy that's pretty cool I kid

01:29:21,029 --> 01:29:26,009
that's that's some spooky I can't knock

01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:33,389
it till you throw a pop it and lock it

01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:36,510
hit smash that lock button like like

01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:39,119
this there's thick with it but you think

01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:41,489
do you think that if you had a super it

01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:43,500
was a really long arm and you could

01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:45,750
actually reach down to the water from

01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:49,859
the deck you think you could catch six

01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:52,529
of them in one hand over the edge with

01:29:49,859 --> 01:29:57,989
with with my yeah with hasar and there

01:29:52,529 --> 01:30:02,550
just like it gets up yeah it's like a

01:29:57,989 --> 01:30:04,469
crane toy this is amazing look she's

01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:06,600
there's like six of them like like she's

01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:08,610
just you you put it down there and he

01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,900
has a few in his in his craw but there's

01:30:08,609 --> 01:30:11,759
a few other ones just hanging off a

01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:13,439
little horns you know like it's just a

01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,289
mess you bring him up and then just just

01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:19,529
like you shake him out on the deck

01:30:15,289 --> 01:30:21,600
waters do 14 and every one of them shows

01:30:19,529 --> 01:30:24,659
exactly the same girl do we think it's

01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:28,320
the same girl all along yeah let's get

01:30:24,659 --> 01:30:31,829
them all Donaar it is I think it's the

01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:34,439
same girl we have to reach 16 girls

01:30:31,829 --> 01:30:36,869
that's okay Father, I know you can do

01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:38,519
this. Are the lockets invading our shared

01:30:36,869 --> 01:30:39,779
momentum at all? I think of shucking the

01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:42,030
water no it's nothing like that

01:30:39,779 --> 01:30:46,039
okay so the ship is cutting right

01:30:42,029 --> 01:30:46,039
through them. okay Scrooge McDuck

01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:52,850
like let's change the sound of the boat

01:30:50,989 --> 01:30:55,789
in the water okay it's just a sort of

01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:59,840
clatter as the front of the boat is just

01:30:55,789 --> 01:31:02,029
cutting through this layer of lockets

01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:03,829
that are sort of floating on top and

01:31:02,029 --> 01:31:06,050
then even the farther down you see like

01:31:03,829 --> 01:31:07,760
you can just see the sunlight shining

01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:11,470
down through, and there's lockets below

01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:17,989
that as well. Ahead of the Merry Widow

01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:22,820
you can see the lighthouse atop a small

01:31:17,989 --> 01:31:30,229
rocky island, and around this you can see

01:31:22,819 --> 01:31:35,779
the bones of ships of varying sizes mmm

01:31:30,229 --> 01:31:42,199
you can see a small D freshly placed in

01:31:35,779 --> 01:31:45,649
a little crook he has not secured it he

01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:48,079
is not to be seen he is not to be seen

01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:51,139
in the boat, or indeed even on them

01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:53,269
ah geez on the surface all right so

01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:56,060
someone needs to go get the Dean then go

01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:57,800
get us yeah I want us to run aground

01:31:56,060 --> 01:32:01,250
here.

01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:03,680
Can we pull up throw anchor safe

01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:04,810
distance so that we are not running

01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:07,369
aground on this island?

01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:08,780
Do we have another method of getting to

01:32:07,369 --> 01:32:13,550
these yeah yeah I mean you know well

01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:15,439
you're know how long this take my fly

01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:17,000
back your sense is that it's quite we

01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:20,089
and we can hear senses that it's quite

01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,010
deep okay around that this is it is

01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:22,520
literally out here in the middle of

01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:28,280
nowhere.

01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:30,350
Okay well even so, generally speaking, a

01:32:28,279 --> 01:32:32,329
bunch of crashed ships around an island is

01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:34,430
not a great thing. They didn't run

01:32:32,329 --> 01:32:38,059
aground. I mean it's it's like it's it's

01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:41,780
just like they're heaped up okay around

01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:45,470
it just like a snap ribs kind of sort of

01:32:41,779 --> 01:32:47,630
lected over rocks like a nest yeah that

01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:52,730
that seems fair okay so is there a safe

01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:54,319
place to I mean you wouldn't tie them is

01:32:52,729 --> 01:32:56,689
that is it does it look like there's a

01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:58,549
spot for that it doesn't seem yeah it

01:32:56,689 --> 01:33:00,869
doesn't seem like it's okay weighted

01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:03,510
towards us far away

01:33:00,869 --> 01:33:06,149
then you I mean I I can I can Park us

01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:08,190
what are your 70 feet away from the

01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:11,699
shore and then - out there

01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:13,889
35 times - right that's how - works you

01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:16,679
can move very quick on her yeah why not

01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:18,990
I'm a monk I can do that I probably

01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:20,869
bounced on to like a broken hull of a

01:33:18,989 --> 01:33:22,109
piece of a ship and then bounced back in

01:33:20,869 --> 01:33:24,479
yeah

01:33:22,109 --> 01:33:28,889
so just right but again like slapping up

01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:31,859
on its on its stone you can see lock it

01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:36,090
after lock it just thick clumps of them

01:33:31,859 --> 01:33:39,509
also the chains sort of bound up close

01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:42,619
you have a wild shape that could

01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:45,780
traverse oh yeah and one that just cuz

01:33:42,619 --> 01:33:49,500
she goes and she's like she's like oh

01:33:45,779 --> 01:33:51,119
yeah I could do that hmm I goes well

01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:54,810
does that'll get me across

01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:56,399
I suppose I could get Rosie across if

01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:57,750
you will permit me to ride on your back

01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:03,289
absolutely

01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:05,640
grandmother of course and then I go so I

01:34:03,289 --> 01:34:14,640
don't know you three wait here or figure

01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:16,440
it out yeah yeah if it's taken long

01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:18,440
enough that I've that I've gotta back

01:34:16,439 --> 01:34:22,229
then I would how long does it take um

01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:23,639
enough for a long rest we took is it no

01:34:22,229 --> 01:34:25,919
I've seen that's a bit if you took a

01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:28,619
short rest and burnt some air yeah stuff

01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,869
I considered talking to Sarah very short

01:34:28,619 --> 01:34:34,859
and very restorative rest enjoyable

01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:36,960
sorry short um but I would imbue you

01:34:34,859 --> 01:34:39,750
with flight because you have the biggest

01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,220
Harry Caray capacity maybe you do either

01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:49,859
one of you that is a better choice than

01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:51,930
me who's stronger arm wrestle yeah it's

01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:54,119
mine even on that list no where did you

01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:56,489
carry really like an on the carry weight

01:34:54,119 --> 01:35:03,050
just right I don't have the normal

01:34:56,488 --> 01:35:03,049
she is stronger what's your strength 17

01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:08,130
so get out here I could've had extra

01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:09,960
points but instead I decided that I was

01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:12,060
going to take feats and everything so

01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:18,960
I'm good like I have proficiency and

01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:20,820
like a half of the skills I was actually

01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,619
going to do a lot more of this but Gigi

01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:24,689
Durham North I can't have really really

01:35:22,619 --> 01:35:26,340
good animal handling I have good

01:35:24,689 --> 01:35:26,488
survival obviously because I'm out on my

01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:33,810
own

01:35:26,488 --> 01:35:36,419
why just keeps going I gently pick up

01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:43,430
rose I go excuse me grandmother and then

01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:54,869
I just jump us before we hit the water

01:35:43,430 --> 01:36:01,890
gracefully wild shape ya know and then I

01:35:54,869 --> 01:36:03,329
turn into a crocodile this is like this

01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:05,070
is like the story of like the monk in

01:36:03,329 --> 01:36:11,069
the crocodile yeah I'm not gonna

01:36:05,069 --> 01:36:12,449
crocodile yeah Kiupid immediately thinks

01:36:11,069 --> 01:36:14,429
that she is so much cooler than you at

01:36:12,449 --> 01:36:16,469
this point because she's like just she

01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:17,880
turned to talk are you seeing that she's

01:36:16,469 --> 01:36:19,079
like she's like she's like she can turn

01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:20,310
it to us she's like she can turn it to

01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:22,109
like there's a lizard thing just any

01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:23,460
time she wants to what kind of skill is

01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:25,380
that I haven't read anything about this

01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:32,730
this is totally different was something

01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:36,020
so fast leans down she goes thank you so

01:36:32,729 --> 01:36:41,459
you look up you you look up atop your

01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:44,489
crocodile conveyance and you see that

01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:46,409
you see Driebus head in one of the

01:36:44,488 --> 01:36:48,750
windows so this is is there's a

01:36:46,409 --> 01:36:52,130
lighthouse top yeah but it has multiple

01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:54,960
floors and windows on each of the floors

01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:58,469
and you see you see Driebus looking out

01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:00,539
of one of the windows you sort of push

01:36:58,469 --> 01:37:03,099
it open like a portal and his hands are

01:37:00,539 --> 01:37:06,219
inside there he says mom

01:37:03,099 --> 01:37:08,380
you don't want to be in here and then

01:37:06,219 --> 01:37:12,819
and his face disappears from the window

01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:13,980
oh sweet baby boy so you guys get up on

01:37:12,819 --> 01:37:20,279
land

01:37:13,979 --> 01:37:24,848
[Laughter]

01:37:20,279 --> 01:37:30,158
alright so we gotta take the Diggy back

01:37:24,849 --> 01:37:33,610
retrieve these flown and that and that

01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:36,460
is basically okay but this is probably

01:37:33,609 --> 01:37:41,848
I'm gonna be way more than 500 pounds

01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:46,538
the other oh yeah two sixty two thirty I

01:37:41,849 --> 01:37:49,389
don't have anything to that cursor is

01:37:46,538 --> 01:37:51,368
negative okay cuz I was like right next

01:37:49,389 --> 01:37:53,529
to you the entire time I guess is 85

01:37:51,368 --> 01:37:55,658
dripping wet son being like close to you

01:37:53,529 --> 01:37:59,649
doing this yes you're doing a special

01:37:55,658 --> 01:38:34,448
time holding all of us and like it's

01:37:59,649 --> 01:38:38,979
gonna be like a so when you when you

01:38:34,448 --> 01:38:43,408
find yourself crawling up on this rocky

01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:47,379
outcropping, you can feel that it is

01:38:43,408 --> 01:38:52,598
shifting in the water. It is not

01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:56,828
stable when you when you approach the

01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:59,710
tower itself on here, it has a sort of it

01:38:56,828 --> 01:39:02,308
has there's no door in the base. It isn't

01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:05,730
simply an opening at the base of this

01:39:02,309 --> 01:39:07,989
tower structure and you saw you saw

01:39:05,729 --> 01:39:11,198
Driebus on the second floor. sir

01:39:07,988 --> 01:39:15,428
Can I do a perception check to determine

01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:19,238
if this is some kind of Mimic sure

01:39:15,429 --> 01:39:21,998
so I know lighthouse now that's a

01:39:19,238 --> 01:39:24,098
lighthouse sniffing 18 yeah this gets

01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:29,849
quite good you think that you think that

01:39:24,099 --> 01:39:33,369
we see a Mimic would have either be more

01:39:29,849 --> 01:39:34,689
flesh you would see at some point you

01:39:33,368 --> 01:39:38,558
it's you'd be aware because you see

01:39:34,689 --> 01:39:41,050
Mimics before by now they're very sticky,

01:39:38,559 --> 01:39:44,079
as you saw with the door. oh yes but you

01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:45,998
would have seen he is as soon as you had

01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:48,009
gotten on, the Mimic would have made its

01:39:45,998 --> 01:39:51,069
play. okay that was your experience

01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:53,050
previously. okay it doesn't wait you know

01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:55,929
what it means sir tonight defines Divine

01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:57,998
Sense yeah tell me more about it

01:39:55,929 --> 01:40:01,239
as an action or the location of any a

01:39:57,998 --> 01:40:02,649
Celestial, Fiend or Undead sure until the

01:40:01,238 --> 01:40:04,178
end of your next turn, and detect the

01:40:02,649 --> 01:40:07,538
presence of any place or object that has

01:40:04,179 --> 01:40:09,578
been consecrated or desecrated as with

01:40:07,538 --> 01:40:12,849
the Hallow spell. like that like button

01:40:09,578 --> 01:40:13,478
you don't even need the desecrate that

01:40:12,849 --> 01:40:15,010
Divine Sense

01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:17,920
Well no no what this would allow you to

01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:20,439
do, would be to determine if a like

01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:23,349
button had been desecrated, but we know it

01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:24,550
has oh yeah yeah so that my alarm is

01:40:23,349 --> 01:40:24,969
just being the in spider-sense is

01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:28,510
tingling.

01:40:24,969 --> 01:40:30,849
all right exactly but what whatever is

01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:33,519
happening here does not match up with

01:40:30,849 --> 01:40:36,489
the categories that Divine Sense is

01:40:33,519 --> 01:40:39,849
designed to assess June cool

01:40:36,488 --> 01:40:46,478
damn it you tried I didn't gold stock

01:40:39,849 --> 01:40:49,439
run detect a shadow full can we can I

01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:52,559
approach the I'll turn back in the woman

01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:56,739
cargo is gonna be super useful here um

01:40:52,559 --> 01:40:57,610
kind of walk up to the plate is there is

01:40:56,738 --> 01:40:58,928
there a door?

01:40:57,609 --> 01:41:00,308
yeah I've so yeah there's there is a

01:40:58,929 --> 01:41:01,899
various infected doorway there's no

01:41:00,309 --> 01:41:04,208
physical doors no physical but there is

01:41:01,899 --> 01:41:05,768
an entrance. Rosie I'm gonna warn you,

01:41:04,208 --> 01:41:07,899
like be careful; there's something weird

01:41:05,769 --> 01:41:10,539
going on here and yeah I'm gonna get to

01:41:07,899 --> 01:41:12,728
the bottom it and I want to use Detect

01:41:10,538 --> 01:41:15,578
Magic to know the presence of magic

01:41:12,729 --> 01:41:19,949
within 30 feet and I can see auras in

01:41:15,578 --> 01:41:19,948
determining the school

01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:26,150
that is what it says. Cool I might have a

01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:28,220
card that has one. I think I have just do

01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:30,529
our thing there's over old for what it

01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:31,280
is mm-hmm that's got it well it doesn't

01:41:30,529 --> 01:41:33,800
say that I'm right

01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:34,909
sheet oh yeah the sheen the sheen is

01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:40,579
awesome as long as you know was like

01:41:34,909 --> 01:41:42,920
certain again as I know it is yeah oh it

01:41:40,579 --> 01:41:44,029
just says, "If you sense magic this way,

01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,739
you can use your action to see a faint

01:41:44,029 --> 01:41:47,000
aura around any visible creature object in

01:41:45,739 --> 01:41:49,340
the area that bears named magic and I

01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,649
learn in school of magic penetrate most

01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:53,300
barriers but is blocked by one foot of

01:41:51,649 --> 01:41:59,659
stone, one inch of common metal, a thin

01:41:53,300 --> 01:42:02,510
sheet of lead, or three feet I'm

01:41:59,659 --> 01:42:06,289
detecting I don't enroll okay yeah you

01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:07,970
don't see anything magical right really

01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:10,010
well I can concentrate so up to ten

01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:12,260
minutes so if anything magical does

01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:13,940
happen yeah I love Rosie and I go yeah

01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:15,619
if anything weird happens I'll be the

01:42:13,939 --> 01:42:18,919
first to know about it and then you'll

01:42:15,619 --> 01:42:20,510
be the second from the weird tapping and

01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:22,670
then and I look back and I see these

01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:29,270
guys and you just want to describe to me

01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:33,649

01:42:33,649 --> 01:42:50,589
be like pinwheeling

01:42:34,819 --> 01:42:53,739
yeah just shoots out my land

01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:58,039
as the crux of the wheel and you to go

01:42:53,739 --> 01:42:59,630
twirling into the sand mightily just

01:42:58,039 --> 01:43:01,550
like head first thing I would do yeah

01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:04,460
yeah like there's there's parts of me

01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:06,980
that is emerging and you can't quite

01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:13,270
tell where the actual lizard is I also

01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:13,269

01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:34,700
itself in keepin Aidid on the Isle and

01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:39,130
you hear you're looking up at this tower

01:43:34,699 --> 01:43:42,880
you hear a Corbin shale say cannons well

01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:47,239
if you look out you can see that a

01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:51,590
tentacle has reached up from the

01:43:47,238 --> 01:43:56,119
direction of the island and is reaching

01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:57,710
up over the ship over the top of it

01:43:56,119 --> 01:44:00,229
entirely and is trying to guess just

01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:10,460
trying to grip it and pull it in that's

01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:12,679

Union how far I mean from the ship right

01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:18,190
now right now you are so far away from

01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,189
the ship that you should roll initiative

01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:22,128
[Music]

01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:32,350
can I can make that happen

01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:44,449
yeah relive my glory excuses all right

01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:49,780
that was Mike Wallace on grass that you

01:45:44,449 --> 01:45:53,449
stand at the entrance of a strange tower

01:45:49,779 --> 01:45:59,509
atop an island that exists on no map

01:45:53,449 --> 01:46:04,340
what do you do do I okay I'm on an

01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:07,369
island all right okay uh and there is a

01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:10,369
stereo structure before you yeah

01:46:07,369 --> 01:46:13,130
am I concerned about I don't do I really

01:46:10,369 --> 01:46:15,710
care about the boat do I care about

01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:21,010
what's happening on the boat you tell me

01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:21,010
Gil drama in New York on buzz yeah yeah

01:46:22,029 --> 01:46:30,469
okay all right I can move really fast

01:46:26,529 --> 01:46:34,880
all right so I look at the tentacle and

01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:38,930
I look at Rosie and I go I go I'm gonna

01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:40,489
go get the girl we gotta we gotta do

01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:43,130
what we gotta we gotta do all this at

01:46:40,489 --> 01:46:48,619
once so I'm gonna I can run pretty

01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:51,949
pretty good and so I can do 35 feet so

01:46:48,619 --> 01:46:54,439
if I - I could do 70 all right yeah you

01:46:51,949 --> 01:46:58,309
can bring your ass off so I wanna go

01:46:54,439 --> 01:46:59,359
exactly so you run directly in so you've

01:46:58,310 --> 01:47:01,789
never been here before

01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:04,579
and so you are you're contending with

01:47:01,789 --> 01:47:06,920
this completely new environment while

01:47:04,579 --> 01:47:09,649
running as fast as you possibly can you

01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,850
see I'm trying to go up yeah exactly but

01:47:09,649 --> 01:47:13,250
you use pairs

01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:16,250
you walk in there is a set of stairs

01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:19,010
that goes down not that and there's a

01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:26,569
set of stairs that goes up a hobbit a

01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:29,690
split level so you say you if you come

01:47:26,569 --> 01:47:33,139
in immediately cut left and run up you

01:47:29,689 --> 01:47:35,879
can see that in the in the stone that is

01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:39,360
that has been heaped up and transferred

01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:43,260
into this tower the mortar itself seems

01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:45,689
to pulse and throb but it's not uniform

01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:51,720
it isn't like between everything it's

01:47:45,689 --> 01:47:53,519
like there is a path that's traced it's

01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:58,619
almost like it's traveling a maze up

01:47:53,520 --> 01:48:04,700
through the structure so as you come up

01:47:58,619 --> 01:48:09,300
to this first floor you are immediately

01:48:04,699 --> 01:48:10,679
kicked as soon as you come up this floor

01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:12,119
you can see the stairs that would take

01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:15,810
you up to the floor where Driebus was

01:48:12,119 --> 01:48:20,010
seen you can see the girl from the

01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:20,910
locket I see her yes and she kicks you

01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:24,869
hmm

01:48:20,909 --> 01:48:26,880
not as hard as she can. oh yeah I know

01:48:24,869 --> 01:48:34,590
what the hell yeah exactly

01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:35,130
AC 15 AC 14 mm-hmm okay that's a quick

01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:39,930
one.

01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:43,199
feast on six straight just straight in

01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:45,780
the middle of your right on your right

01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:48,899
on your diaphragm but this is this is

01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:52,139
the this is launched exactly your face

01:48:48,899 --> 01:48:53,939
is haunch so this is the thing that is

01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:58,230
this is the thing that is disturbing

01:48:53,939 --> 01:49:02,039
about it the entire time she is visiting

01:48:58,229 --> 01:49:07,549
this upon you, her ostensible savior, yeah

01:49:02,039 --> 01:49:11,970
her face has never lost this sort of

01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:16,230
despondency. Like the same terrified

01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:20,640
person is it's like she looks like she

01:49:16,229 --> 01:49:25,229
is just as disturbed as she ever was. She

01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:34,500
is still completely 100% in this wave

01:49:25,229 --> 01:49:36,539
dear I can take it laughing face is the

01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:40,890
same thing as the red hourglass on a

01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:42,899
black widow. It's just that's it

01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:44,520
it's your turn but you're - you took a -

01:49:42,899 --> 01:49:49,500
as an action right I didn't know if I

01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:53,480
used it you did yes yeah it's cool well

01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:53,479
I promise action Wildshape I kill her

01:49:55,289 --> 01:50:01,739
Walnut Rosie Beestinger, uh your son is

01:49:59,819 --> 01:50:05,099
currently on the second floor of this

01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:09,420
and you can hear a muffled version of

01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:14,400
your son's voice yeah red downing from

01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:20,220
the window between Driebus and Walnut all

01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:23,579
your kids are in this so yeah F that

01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:26,340
boat um and I'm just gonna run up after

01:50:23,579 --> 01:50:28,140
Walnut I'm not gonna I'm not gonna - and

01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:29,789
let's it's required though I'm gonna try

01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:31,950
to you were right here in the doorway

01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:33,689
like you could very easily use your move

01:50:31,949 --> 01:50:38,010
and get to where Walnut okay okay I'd

01:50:33,689 --> 01:50:40,500
like to do that so I see what

01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:42,449
so as you you jump in you see what she

01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:47,340
saw there is a set of stairs that goes

01:50:42,449 --> 01:50:49,439
down you can see plainly this is a rock

01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:52,199
outcropping okay you have no idea what

01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:55,139
down would even mean right right to your

01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:56,909
left set of stairs go up and at the top

01:50:55,140 --> 01:51:00,750
of those stairs

01:50:56,909 --> 01:51:03,960
you see Walnut on grass doubled over and

01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:05,460
in front of her you can see the girl

01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:09,930
from the locket and she looks at you

01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:13,079
with so much pain and longing and

01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:16,079
loneliness hmm and I look at Walnut and

01:51:13,079 --> 01:51:17,550
I look at her and I see I say I can tell

01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:29,789
you're in pain but you're about to be in

01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:32,789
a lot more okay um so I'm going to I'm

01:51:29,789 --> 01:51:38,909
gonna attack the hell out of her I'm

01:51:32,789 --> 01:51:41,039
ready I will do some good the whole the

01:51:38,909 --> 01:51:46,609
whole tamale this time oh you mean like

01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:49,350
with the key points and like yeah I mean

01:51:46,609 --> 01:51:51,479
yeah I mean I think what I would like to

01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:54,060
do is is disable her to the point where

01:51:51,479 --> 01:51:56,699
she's no longer attacking us yeah I

01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:59,700
would not like to kill her but I will if

01:51:56,699 --> 01:52:01,109
I have to oh okay so I'm gonna do would

01:51:59,699 --> 01:52:04,859
you like me to just do all of my attacks

01:52:01,109 --> 01:52:06,539
Oh last time it works pretty good for us

01:52:04,859 --> 01:52:07,949
to know which attacks hit and missed

01:52:06,539 --> 01:52:12,329
okay and then come up with a cool store

01:52:07,949 --> 01:52:16,949
okay sounds good so um I am seven timid

01:52:12,329 --> 01:52:21,449
so that's a nine that's another nine and

01:52:16,949 --> 01:52:24,119
that's a 17 and that is my oh I got two

01:52:21,449 --> 01:52:26,279
okay those are those are my it's my

01:52:24,119 --> 01:52:28,399
quarterstaff strikes both miss I assume

01:52:26,279 --> 01:52:32,309
and then my unarmed strikes are coming

01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:34,859
which is a 19 so those I think probably

01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:37,020
both hits so yours that sort of staff is

01:52:34,859 --> 01:52:39,509
all misses but then when you start to

01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:41,490
connect with your your physical body

01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:46,619
correct they all land yeah and I'm gonna

01:52:41,489 --> 01:52:49,619
chalk that up to a berserker rage that I

01:52:46,619 --> 01:52:52,559
entered that it jeopardizes my

01:52:49,619 --> 01:52:54,779
monastic focus and as soon as I realized

01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,450
that my staff's wings were flying wildly

01:52:54,779 --> 01:53:00,210
out of control I took a deep breath

01:52:57,449 --> 01:53:07,829
before entering my unarmed strikes which

01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:10,819
are going to be plump 9 - and a that's a

01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:14,510
I'm at the one I'm lucky so I roll that

01:53:10,819 --> 01:53:16,889
that is another 9 so 18 damage on her Oh

01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:21,420
healthy Jesus Christ

01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:23,070
Rosie be stinger so there's a piece of

01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:24,180
the puzzle that I'm missing and I'm

01:53:23,069 --> 01:53:29,729
hoping you can help me with it

01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:32,789
okay her sort of crumpled form of long a

01:53:29,729 --> 01:53:34,559
dong grass was at the very top of the

01:53:32,789 --> 01:53:36,000
stairs where she had received a savage

01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,890
tip cracks can you tell me how you

01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,289
navigate that space with your monk

01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:41,910
techniques because this could also this

01:53:40,289 --> 01:53:43,769
could also help us understand why the

01:53:41,909 --> 01:53:45,630
first couple quarters strife to the

01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:47,430
quarter staff strikes missed right right

01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:50,340
so she's right there how do you get

01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:52,710
around her to engage with this entity is

01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:54,119
she blocking the entire mean she's but

01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:56,550
she's like hunched over she's like down

01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:59,789
okay so tell me how it happens you know

01:53:56,550 --> 01:54:02,420
I'm gonna yeah yeah I think so

01:53:59,789 --> 01:54:04,920
you're I would normally just like

01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:05,819
perhaps give you some kind of warning

01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,219
and then

01:54:05,819 --> 01:54:09,539
you as a jumping point but I'm a little

01:54:08,219 --> 01:54:10,889
worried I don't know how bad you've been

01:54:09,539 --> 01:54:12,960
hurt so I don't I don't want to

01:54:10,889 --> 01:54:16,920
jeopardize you but I will do the same

01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:20,368
thing only using the wall so I will jump

01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:22,319
to the right of Walnut with my feet on

01:54:20,368 --> 01:54:25,979
the wall and then use my staff to push

01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:30,750
off swing wildly miss both times land

01:54:25,979 --> 01:54:32,039
and then reach back for two punches this

01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:34,590
is a thing though have you ever seen

01:55:25,158 --> 01:55:32,839
lumber my way in exactly silly so yeah

01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:36,300
so as you're moving in you can hear

01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:39,420
concussive blows you know hear the sound

01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:41,340
of the quarter staff straight you know

01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:43,739
is striking through the air hitting the

01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:47,279
rock walls right at the top of this

01:55:43,738 --> 01:55:51,539
stairs you can see Walnut just doubled

01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:54,359
over in pain and that's the predicament

01:55:51,539 --> 01:55:55,859
you see yourself with this this this is

01:55:54,359 --> 01:55:59,848
a young woman from the locket that you

01:55:55,859 --> 01:56:05,158
had seen is is basically between Walnut

01:55:59,849 --> 01:56:08,369
and grandmother so I get up the stairs

01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:11,219
I see Walnut her double down down I see

01:56:08,368 --> 01:56:13,500
Rosie attacking this girl who looks

01:56:11,219 --> 01:56:16,139
troubled and scared yeah and getting

01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:18,420
beat up and then I go

01:56:16,139 --> 01:56:23,159
we're here to save right I would be like

01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:25,770
I don't know who got hurt I don't know

01:56:23,158 --> 01:56:30,929
why I see this is a very complicated all

01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:33,690
right yeah so thank you can can I say

01:56:30,929 --> 01:56:35,550
yeah absolutely but I want to give you

01:56:33,689 --> 01:56:38,189
an extra piece of information whoa

01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:40,409
she has just been struck twice mm-hmm

01:56:38,189 --> 01:56:42,960
and you can see like she should have

01:56:40,408 --> 01:56:46,920
been tugged much farther over but you

01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:49,649
can see there's almost like a stem there

01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:52,170
is a that is ripping from her hair okay

01:56:49,649 --> 01:56:55,888
and is extending up almost into the

01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:58,590
darkness of the ceiling above it so

01:56:55,889 --> 01:57:04,260
she's like a real like a marionette kind

01:56:58,590 --> 01:57:06,060
of thing so it's like weird little uvula

01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:07,679
or maybe it's like a Mimic I Mimic maybe

it's academically like Mimics Mimic oh

01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:13,859
yes well observing that this situation

01:57:10,889 --> 01:57:15,480
becomes a little more clear okay I guess

01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:17,908
I would yell first before I did anything

01:57:15,479 --> 01:57:19,709

during the day so as you as you because

01:59:08,198 --> 01:59:13,148
you reach the top of these stairs and

01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:17,878
look in at this scenario you can see

01:59:13,149 --> 01:59:20,499
that there are two two girls hmm

01:59:17,878 --> 01:59:26,229
similar to the locket girls with the

01:59:20,498 --> 01:59:28,208
same faces but they're like distended

01:59:26,229 --> 01:59:33,039
and puffy

01:59:28,208 --> 01:59:36,188
mm-hmm like them like overripe like see

01:59:33,038 --> 01:59:37,389
blood no no no like like they've been

01:59:36,189 --> 01:59:40,329
like they've been on the counter too

01:59:37,389 --> 01:59:42,760
long okay so I'm up on the second level

01:59:40,328 --> 01:59:46,688
nail this fight blow down on level one I

01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:50,409
think I see Jesus he's he's contending

01:59:46,689 --> 01:59:54,309
he's competing with him because he does

01:59:50,408 --> 01:59:57,188
not he does not he has his he has a wand

01:59:54,309 --> 01:59:59,050
and he has a sword and you can tell that

01:59:57,189 --> 02:00:01,959
he like doesn't know which one he wants

01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:08,288
to use at that exact time but he's like

02:00:01,958 --> 02:00:10,510
I'm really really confused you guys okay

02:00:08,288 --> 02:00:12,309
still more I feel like I've done all the

02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:14,050
things I can do tell me what you want to

02:00:12,309 --> 02:00:16,199

02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:24,309
I'll give you one of your two attacks

02:00:16,198 --> 02:00:26,049
all right it's got all my so many yeah I

02:00:24,309 --> 02:00:29,670
say everyone should offer ten minutes

02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:31,480
something around my speed yeah I'm good

02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:34,929
toothbrush room I'll toothbrush

02:00:31,479 --> 02:00:36,368
something let's see it I just run past

02:00:34,929 --> 02:00:42,989
him and just go after the first one

02:00:36,368 --> 02:00:44,348
mm-hmm that's a ten plus six mm-hmm

02:00:42,988 --> 02:00:47,729
exactly

02:00:44,349 --> 02:00:51,670
already roll 2d six plus three yeah

02:00:47,729 --> 02:00:54,308
Jesus yeah you you slice straight

02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:56,469
through what it's not there's no bone

02:00:54,309 --> 02:01:00,670
hmm of any kind

02:00:56,469 --> 02:01:02,649
they just cut straight through and the

02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:05,699
two halves just heap themselves up on

02:01:02,649 --> 02:01:10,899
the floor it comes off like the the stem

02:01:05,698 --> 02:01:12,460
comes off like like a imagine like an

02:01:10,899 --> 02:01:15,479
apple at the overripe Apple it just

02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:20,828
gonna close out okay

02:01:15,479 --> 02:01:24,488
indeed indeed now it is the turn for the

02:01:20,828 --> 02:01:27,099
opponents and so everyone who is inside

02:01:24,488 --> 02:01:32,289
the tower I need to have dexterity

02:01:27,099 --> 02:01:42,300
checks no we're cool for this day okay

02:01:32,289 --> 02:01:51,880
we rolled lower good Baker's 15 no

02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:55,300
that's a 2-1 just want you to know thank

02:01:51,880 --> 02:02:01,239
you Mars but Donaar takes four and you

02:01:55,300 --> 02:02:06,730
take one so the entire structure shifts

02:02:01,238 --> 02:02:10,859
beneath you and the tower itself begins

02:02:06,729 --> 02:02:14,500
to tilt in the air so you are able to

02:02:10,859 --> 02:02:16,779
you are able to position yourself in

02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:19,630
such a way that you are able to

02:02:16,779 --> 02:02:22,658
withstand this shift and of course the

02:02:19,630 --> 02:02:27,400
the face of your assailant is just

02:02:22,658 --> 02:02:30,399
continuously surprised by everything but

02:02:27,399 --> 02:02:34,960
you can see outside is you can see more

02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:37,750
tentacles rising up reaching for the

02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:41,220
boat grabbing it and trying to pull it

02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:43,890
in but the top of the tower

02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:47,180
is tilting itself over the boat as it

02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:51,119
brings it in and it's shaking itself

02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:55,500
like a like a salt shaker over the deck

02:02:51,119 --> 02:03:00,739
of the boat and you can see five or six

02:02:55,500 --> 02:03:03,930
like wave lights yes five five or six of

02:03:00,739 --> 02:03:07,559
these of these creatures that I have you

02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:09,690
know previously described just falling

02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:13,550
out of the windows and drawing

02:03:09,689 --> 02:03:13,549
themselves up on the deck of the ship

02:03:14,569 --> 02:03:21,539
you pit now we got the same problem I

02:03:17,899 --> 02:03:23,039
have no idea which is you now

02:03:21,539 --> 02:03:28,590
I mean you dropped a bomb on me there um

02:03:23,039 --> 02:03:42,050
well food yes squishy overripe fruit so

02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:45,510
I just do my Kiupid would do yeah is into

02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:47,340
I'm gonna that's one option

02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:48,480
no I'm gonna run in what my other option

02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:50,909
is to go towards the boat where there's

02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:55,619
all these other goodies indeed indeed so

02:03:50,909 --> 02:03:59,130
there are there are thick rich tendrils

02:03:55,619 --> 02:04:00,720
know as I said reaching out and grabbing

02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:04,650
the boat

02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:06,480
so there's mechanism denying isn't the

02:04:04,649 --> 02:04:08,099
tango oh yeah you both are and I'm just

02:04:06,479 --> 02:04:09,569
like I'm gonna run right after him keeps

02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:13,829
obviously cuz obviously so I'm ready

02:04:09,569 --> 02:04:17,340
bikini how far do I get let's see from

02:04:13,829 --> 02:04:19,109
where you are you can get up to I'm you

02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:21,239
can get to where Rosie is but the

02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:25,199
interior structure of this is deeply

02:04:21,239 --> 02:04:28,109
unlike a tower now it's it's pretty

02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:30,720
cockeyed in there okay and so you're

02:04:28,109 --> 02:04:32,670
basically just trying to walk up this

02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:34,850
sort of halfway tilted side so I need

02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:37,850
some decks just to get in there okay

02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:37,850
okay

02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:46,619
7 plus 0 is 7 you are trying your best

02:04:43,649 --> 02:04:49,229
you're not injured but it's like a

02:04:46,619 --> 02:04:51,750
funhouse in here you're trying your best

02:04:49,229 --> 02:04:55,099
to maneuver yourself up these stairs as

02:04:51,750 --> 02:05:01,800
you can see you can see Denard blitzen's

02:04:55,100 --> 02:05:04,560
servant Rosie yeah one who's just a

02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:06,779
smallish grandma a lot so I'm kind of

02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:08,880
Terry you don't know this is grandfather

02:05:06,779 --> 02:05:10,859
you don't grandma there's a lot of

02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:12,840
information there and you can interpret

02:05:10,859 --> 02:05:14,250
it any way you want to emphasis as the

02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:17,640
scribes have done there is there is an

02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:21,000
entry might not and do I get an action

02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:24,570
or I mean you can see you can see up at

02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:27,000
the top of these stairs it would be very

02:05:24,569 --> 02:05:29,549
challenging to do so but it's not

02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:35,189
impossible if you have arranged

02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:37,860
mechanism she is down at the bottom

02:05:35,189 --> 02:05:40,889
being jostled around as is apparently

02:05:37,859 --> 02:05:44,969
currently her way she's jostled and she

02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:48,650
goes stop in the Blitz an accord halt

02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:51,329
and instead of her just saying no

02:05:48,649 --> 02:05:54,449
suddenly fire erupts from her hands and

02:05:51,329 --> 02:05:57,180
it's burning hands oh no this is gonna

02:05:54,449 --> 02:06:05,579
be action taxes yep each creature in the

02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:08,039
15 foot cone which will also be you take

02:06:05,579 --> 02:06:10,109
half as much damage anyway yeah she's

02:06:08,039 --> 02:06:12,329
bringing Dex you back yeah yeah I'm not

02:06:10,109 --> 02:06:14,130
hearing this mixes we mean yeah I mean

02:06:12,329 --> 02:06:25,710
oh no cuz I didn't even make it that oh

02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:27,869
my god I am killing so dish up the

send him with some speed with some

02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:23,989
caution doesn't matter that's just for

02:09:21,529 --> 02:09:26,000
flavor I want him to go down yeah I'm

02:09:23,988 --> 02:09:28,309

there the mouths of these so you you

02:09:28,310 --> 02:09:37,070
situate yourself get yourself supported

02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:38,989
right and then convey yourself via your

02:09:37,069 --> 02:09:42,529
crystal serpent hmm

02:09:38,988 --> 02:09:46,250
your crystal serpent slides like a dark

02:09:42,529 --> 02:09:48,949
slinky thank you imagine if you will and

02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:53,500
he finds his way down to the base and

02:09:48,949 --> 02:09:57,619
you see something that titillates you

02:09:53,500 --> 02:10:00,680
Wow on every level hmm but he retaliated

02:09:57,619 --> 02:10:05,390
from the hair from your incredibly

02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:10,369
quaffed hair all the way to your amazing

02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:20,090
as toe I do anything is cool for the

02:10:10,369 --> 02:10:23,960
feet you see a black gate I didn't want

02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:31,909
to split the party by will you see eight

02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:35,989
symbols no surrounding a group of three

02:10:31,909 --> 02:10:38,420
empty spaces in the middle three empty

02:10:35,988 --> 02:10:41,988
spaces so exact same configuration is

02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:44,409
the time yes the acid the correct acid

02:10:41,988 --> 02:10:46,939
room that is correct the Crypt

02:10:44,409 --> 02:10:48,829
the wandering crib hells bells that

02:10:46,939 --> 02:10:49,869
sounds called the shard link that's

02:10:48,829 --> 02:10:52,340
right

02:10:49,869 --> 02:10:55,579
might I have any reason to think that

02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:58,078
this gate occurs only in the wandering

02:10:55,579 --> 02:11:00,328
crypt are we you know part of it now

02:10:58,078 --> 02:11:02,488
you don't have any idea what that might

02:11:00,328 --> 02:11:04,558
represent but I have every confidence

02:11:02,488 --> 02:11:07,198
that you will destroy the party this

02:11:04,559 --> 02:11:10,949
time hey let's see what happens

02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:12,839
oh my god so you can make you use your

02:11:10,948 --> 02:11:14,549
turn so I've got a monitor Shelton to

02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:17,309
Loogootee yeah and now he's down there

02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:20,520
and now he's down there yes okay and

02:11:17,309 --> 02:11:23,039
it's his turn - what would he do what

02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:25,170
I'm if I were my do when he's starting

02:11:23,039 --> 02:11:26,939
to see the symbols and it was through he

02:11:25,170 --> 02:11:29,039
was inexplicably drawn to it and my

02:11:26,939 --> 02:11:31,078
weasel self had to get him in the mouth

02:11:29,039 --> 02:11:32,939
and drag him and that oh and do that he

02:11:31,078 --> 02:11:34,500
wasn't very go into it yeah it's a good

02:11:32,939 --> 02:11:36,149
thing that we didn't do reverse turn

02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:38,279
order because I would have sent him down

02:11:36,149 --> 02:11:41,219
and then upon seeing that I would have

02:11:38,279 --> 02:11:46,349
misty step down mm-hmm exactly on there

02:11:41,219 --> 02:11:51,300
exactly Legault teas instinct yeah is

02:11:46,349 --> 02:11:56,099
that of a creature against a predator

02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:58,920
right then I mean yeah what I would have

02:11:56,099 --> 02:11:59,610
to say to him it doesn't matter at this

02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:05,880
point

02:11:59,609 --> 02:12:09,779
so he yeah he's gonna oh he's got his

02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:13,828
he's got his dagger William Tate it's

02:12:09,779 --> 02:12:16,189
whittling there so he approaches the as

02:12:13,828 --> 02:12:19,590
near as he can get to that to that gate

02:12:16,189 --> 02:12:22,919
and he's searching for something to put

02:12:19,590 --> 02:12:25,889
a dagger and to assert himself yeah yeah

02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:28,500
he was this object he knows he that he

02:12:25,889 --> 02:12:30,210
has to have dominance over what is it

02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:32,099
what does he see that it's couldn't have

02:12:30,210 --> 02:12:36,000
a dagger put into it it's a it is a it

02:12:32,099 --> 02:12:38,940
is a clean face just as it was before

02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:42,779
but as I suggested and when you when

02:12:38,939 --> 02:12:47,638
you'd used it previously you know there

02:12:42,779 --> 02:12:51,658
was except one symbol but then the other

02:12:47,639 --> 02:12:54,300
two regions had nothing they had no

02:12:51,658 --> 02:12:56,879
input not and that's what that's what

02:12:54,300 --> 02:13:01,800
created the negative impact previously

02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:04,469
so there is there is it is featureless

02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:06,090
except for these symbols it is not a it

02:13:04,469 --> 02:13:08,809
doesn't have anything like a keyhole in

02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:11,079
the classic sense I do have three

02:13:08,809 --> 02:13:12,940
symbols now

02:13:11,079 --> 02:13:15,069
that's interesting the one that it was I

02:13:12,939 --> 02:13:16,750
have three now that's an interesting

02:13:15,069 --> 02:13:19,000
coincidence Oh weird

02:13:16,750 --> 02:13:24,159
well the guy he's done so he's got down

02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:27,850
there and one on grass well I haven't

02:13:24,159 --> 02:13:29,739
I'm not I'm not like I didn't know about

02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:32,320
what you're doing I see you looking at a

02:13:29,739 --> 02:13:34,859
wall well I say that when I say told you

02:13:32,319 --> 02:13:37,509
I'm going downstairs a minute because I

02:13:34,859 --> 02:13:39,369
what I would like to convey in that

02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:42,940
message yeah is I'm going downstairs

02:13:39,369 --> 02:13:45,220
because that's where the the heart of

02:13:42,939 --> 02:13:48,279
this living being this non lighthouse is

02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:50,500
I'm gonna kill this yeah huge object

02:13:48,279 --> 02:13:54,420
does that that's inserted that have no

02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:54,420
more message after that that's gonna say

02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:58,989
[Applause]

02:13:59,850 --> 02:14:06,010
hey I'm having a moment where I'm like

02:14:02,079 --> 02:14:08,199
do I just want to go down there or is

02:14:06,010 --> 02:14:09,909
well not like Oh stairs sucks you're

02:14:08,199 --> 02:14:12,210
trying to figure it out I'm trying to

02:14:09,909 --> 02:14:15,430
figure out what wasn't in her defense

02:14:12,210 --> 02:14:17,380
her introduction to the first floor was

02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:20,170
not a positive one she would leave a

02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:22,569
negative review of that floor okay yeah

02:14:20,170 --> 02:14:25,270
I thought we don't fire she looks it

02:14:22,569 --> 02:14:32,649
Kiupid and then she gives her in the same

02:14:25,270 --> 02:14:34,930
gesture Kia Peters like melting down a

02:14:32,649 --> 02:14:37,059
little bit she's like and then she's

02:14:34,930 --> 02:14:39,250
like almost like you did fine

02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:40,600
and so then she looks like it's like the

02:14:39,250 --> 02:14:41,979
whole tower is listing and stuff so

02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:45,039
she's gonna like just kind of like just

02:14:41,979 --> 02:14:47,079
so along the side just like liquify

02:14:45,039 --> 02:14:49,989
yourself down like

02:14:47,079 --> 02:14:53,559
she's getting really seasick and go up

02:14:49,989 --> 02:14:55,479
to Catherine and then she goes okay you

02:14:53,560 --> 02:15:00,510
took care of the boat right the boats

02:14:55,479 --> 02:15:04,869
fine and then I think she would use uh

02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:07,030
issues you'd be like just like I guess

02:15:04,869 --> 02:15:08,739
take a couple steps towards the Amish I

02:15:07,029 --> 02:15:10,899
gotta do anything sure nothing to do on

02:15:08,739 --> 02:15:13,510
this turn she and will look down in the

02:15:10,899 --> 02:15:15,639
basement yeah I haven't conveyed to you

02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:16,900
what's in the basement I'm going down

02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:20,020
there cuz there's the coroner oh yeah

02:15:16,899 --> 02:15:23,619
but you all you find is me and my my

02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:25,150
vision traded right oh I forgot a

02:15:23,619 --> 02:15:26,380
holding action okay so I'm gonna hold

02:15:25,149 --> 02:15:28,829
actually if he walks down there I'll

02:15:26,380 --> 02:15:32,350
walk with him okay yeah sounds good

02:15:28,829 --> 02:15:34,779
Rosie be stinger um I'm gonna continue

02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:37,510
upward or I guess we're gonna have some

02:15:34,779 --> 02:15:38,409
cars word yeah yeah I need to go to wear

02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:41,289
dresses

02:15:38,409 --> 02:15:43,840
indeed so once one floor up yeah

02:15:41,289 --> 02:15:46,359
wherever up is exactly team definition

02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:48,159
so I think that this is much easier for

02:15:46,359 --> 02:15:51,429
you than it would be for someone else

02:15:48,159 --> 02:15:53,229
right I don't think Rosie cares about

02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:55,900
the shape of the battlefield

02:15:53,229 --> 02:15:58,449
no never hasn't it what I mean okay so

02:15:55,899 --> 02:16:00,969
just just like foot by foot just like

02:15:58,449 --> 02:16:03,399
stairs wall stairs wall stairs wall

02:16:00,970 --> 02:16:05,170
right up to this other thing about over

02:16:03,399 --> 02:16:09,369
to this other tier right this other deck

02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:11,770
of imagine a dark cake oh well and this

02:16:09,369 --> 02:16:15,039
this over this upper slice you can see

02:16:11,770 --> 02:16:19,660
that the the shift of this brevis is now

02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:20,979
just beneath these two creatures you

02:16:19,659 --> 02:16:23,949
know you haven't seen them yet

02:16:20,979 --> 02:16:27,399
but as I described them their versions

02:16:23,949 --> 02:16:30,039
age adverse uns like the color of a

02:16:27,399 --> 02:16:32,489
bruise yeah well I killed one yeah one

02:16:30,039 --> 02:16:34,540
