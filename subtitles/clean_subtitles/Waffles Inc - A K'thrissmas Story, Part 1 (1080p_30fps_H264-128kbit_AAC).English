00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,339
\dm If this goes according to plan, you, as

00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:10,009
the listener, will already hear the

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,690
sounds of an inn in furious operation.

00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:14,638
Thj sounds from the kitchen... maybe this

00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:17,070
would be a good time -- this is an editor's

00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:20,278
note -- maybe a clanging sound of some kind, 

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:36,510
something in there.

\kris What about like a cappuccino

00:00:20,278 --> 00:01:00,420
machine? \direct{makes a cappuccino machine noise} 

\dm There's no such thing.

\ryan Get that seagull out of here! \direct{makes a seagull noise}

\dm God damn you. 

\someone Can I make a smoothie?

\dm It's very important that I establish the scene. It's in the

00:00:36,509 --> 00:01:03,238
Dran and Courtier, ok, now you can do whatever you want.

\ryan I didn't know we were this close to a lighthouse. \direct{makes a foghorn noise} 

\someone Is that a whale?

\someone Is that a dolphin?

\StageDir{(overlapping animal noises)}

\someone Should we just start over at this point?

\dm Now

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,338
you simply explore the space.

\holly Alright, is

00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,829
there a kitchen? 

\dm Explore this space. No, I

00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,719
mean in a conversational context.

\strix Well, I'm

00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,519
gonna go to the kitchen.

\holly Strix goes to

00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,530
the kitchen. 

\dm You can do whatever you want.

00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,829
\holly She's really scared of the

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,590
lady with the mace. 

\dm The mace is very large.

00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:23,118
The handle of the mace, indeed, the

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,500
entire grip, is perhaps the size of Strix.

00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,659
\holly Jesus. Okay.

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,030
\kate Are we maybe in a festive mood? Is it a

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,060
festive time of year?

\dm It is. What I have,

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,969
well, Chris Perkins can tell you why

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,040
there might be a festive atmosphere

00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:40,200
inside the inn. I thought he had a very

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,930
good suggestion earlier

\Chris It's K'thrissmas

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,310
coming! 

\StageDir{Sounds of amazement all around} 

\dm That's right.

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,200
\kate Chris Perkins, what is K'thrissmas exactly?

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,670
\chris Well, I would tell you that it has

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,710
something to do with K'thriss,

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,450
and so I'm gonna pass the microphone to

00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,239
K'thriss, and he's gonna tell you what it

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:06,600
means to him. 

\kthriss It doesn't mean anything to

00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:10,049
me!

\someone That is a lie, and you know it.

\kate That is very K'thriss!
 
\kthriss It means that... people try to describe

00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,030
to me why we have rituals. 

\chris It was a

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,750
deeply personal experience, and we have

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,750
co-opted it.

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:21,310
\dm Functionally speaking, K'thrissmas is an event, at least in the

00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:24,069
pseudo-canon we have generated. It's been

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,830
something that you, K'thriss Drow'b, in

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:29,859
your solitude over hundreds of years,

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,770
have observed personally.

\kthriss Yes, it is a

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:36,310
time of celebrating _no_ holiday, the

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:39,760
absence of holiday.

\dm And what has happened 

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,789
as a doomed practice, is that

00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,649
now others have begun to celebrate it

00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:47,949
also, and they have added ever-more-elaborate 

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,020
rules to what was a personal,

00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:52,000
private observation.

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,340
\kthriss These aren't traditions, they didn't

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,819
exist before! Everybody's just adding

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:05,230
stuff onto the top! 

\chris What was a void, is now an anti-void.

\someone I think Evelyn at this point comes

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:16,299
skipping by, singing,

\evelyn \direct K'thrissmastime, K'thrissmastime! We all love K'thrissmastime! When we share our hugs and kisses, and we make the Christmas wishes! And we light the Christmas candle...

00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:19,089
\someone She justRoutinely mispronounces it.

\someone But she's making up five

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,240
traditions every verse. She's adding on.

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,620
\dm All of which must be observed. 

\holly Every time Strix

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,590
leaves the kitchen, and she's doing that she

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:31,450
just turns right around. 

\kate Rosie comes

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,250
up to K'thriss at some point and will say

00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:35,459
like, 

\rosie You're right, I shouldn't have told

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,460
anyone about K'thrissmas. I'm really sorry.

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,530
\kthriss Hey, they just missed the point, and they

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,479
like to celebrate, and I feel like that's

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:49,840
what they really wanted to do. 

\someone I love to celebrate!

\kthriss Which is

00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:55,679
fine, but this was my time to celebrate

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:58,539
not 

\someone ... celebrating.

\kthriss ...doing that. Yes, thank you voice from the inn...


00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,330
somewhere...

\someone As he's saying this,

00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:04,810
Paultin like just drunkenly stumbles

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,969
to K'thriss like,

\paultin Hey man, I want you to

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,830
know this holiday that you've chosen to

00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,560
share with everybody, is a wonderful

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,660
thing. I love all the traditions, it's

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,329
very... it's very nice, and well thought out.

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:21,850
This is definitely, definitely a great...

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,879
established holiday. 

\someone And then he just

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,350
like slams and hits the floor.

\trystan Walnut comes

00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,300
over with a form in her hand, 

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,700
and she goes,

\walnut Can I please get that in

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,500
writing? I really need to send that to

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,599
Head Office that this is going well.

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,889
I need Omin to know. It's really

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,040
important that Omin knows this is going

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,069
well.

\trystan And I take his hand, his drunken

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,319
passed-out hand, and start signing for him.

00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:59,860
\someone ...wakes up and just like, slaps the paper

00:04:44,319 --> 00:05:01,810
out of your hand.

\walnut Too late! This is legally binding.

\kris. He moved his hand, it counts.

\someone Shit, you got me.

\someone It's signed Pauuu

\someone Who's Paull?

\somen During those

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,759
shenanigans, as a means of getting the

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,490
ready for the celebration, I imagine people

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,259
were decorating around the inn, and

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,460
the like?
\dm Oh yeah, there's plenty

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:14,379
of opportunities for festive

00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,789
laurels, maybe. 

\someone Diath is no good at that, I

00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:17,980
imagine Evelyn has probably already

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,480
taken the brunt of most of that. 

\someone He is 

00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,340
like putting stuff up, and she like,

00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,050
secretly behind him, take it down and fix

00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,729
it.

\chris What kind of stuff are you

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,370
putting up? Like what is a K'thrissmas

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:31,990
decoration?

\ryan Mangers. Everywhere.

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:34,600
Just like tons of mangers.

\someone Diath is not entirely sure.

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,150
There's probably like brightly scraps of

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,890
cloth, not necessarily like cleanly cut,

00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:40,449
to be decorative, but just shreds that

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,329
were available, and was kind of putting that up.

00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:48,339
\dm Garbage? 

\someone Yeah! But brightly colored

00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:50,919
garbage. And Diath, not knowing where to

00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:53,109
even like really put things, or what even

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,879
works and just kind of gives up. He's

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,240
decided that his contribution would be

00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,009
to ration out the supplies, and divvy it

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
up, and be like okay you guys can handle

00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,189
_these_. He'll like-- he brought stuff to

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,170
Evelyn, who took it right away, and then

00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:07,480
he grabs like another small wooden

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,910
apple crate of additional

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,540
scraps of cloth, and maybe some shards of

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,430
glass that could probably reflect light.

\someone The

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,920
traditional glass shards!

\holly It's probably stuff

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,290
that Strix already had. 

\dm Yeah it's know

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,449
it's stuff that a snail might leave a

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,720
trail of mucus, these are they're

00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:28,719
simply treasures that emerge from Strix's

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,790
wake as she travels. 

\someone Naturally. yeah

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,630
maybe like the shedded skin of a spider

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,550
or something.

00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:35,439
yeah he'll take a small crate of that,

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,540
and bring it over the bar and just be

00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,480
like, Here you go, buddy. Spider shavings.

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,980
yeah

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,430
Got a label on it that says "spider

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,680
shavings for K'thrissmas"
\dm Do not open until K'thrissmas! 

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,269
\holly There's an empty jar that on

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,780
the outside. It says, "I wish this was

00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:56,099
filled with eyeballs", sad face.

\rosie Rosie... Like,

00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,829
Strix has been leaving these notes

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,390
around aggressively for months.

00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:01,769
Like, just whenever she comes to visit,

00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,959
she's leaving these freaking notes

00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:05,579
around. Rosie has started

00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,180
checking on her jar of eyeballs like

00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:10,709
every hour. 

\dm Counting? 

\rosie Yes, sure. She knows

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,040
_exactly_ how many eyeballs are in there,

00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:15,329
and she will know if one is missing.

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,590
\someone Diath brings a crate over to Donaar and just is

00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:17,279
like,

\diath All right, be really careful with

00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,229
the glass.

00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,159
Some of it might still be sharp.

\donaar That's

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:25,830
that's tough but fair. 

\ryan I just stand there

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,380
and hold this box for a minute. I want to walk

00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:31,229
over to K'thris. Note for the listeners: so,

00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,790
we're recording this way in the past. I'm

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,230
gonna make some assumptions between

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,150
now and when this is released, on some

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,970
things that happened.

\kris Sure, okay.

\ryan So I go over to

00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:41,310
K'thriss and I say, You know, I never got to

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,520
thank you for those like, when we met--

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,250
that we had to fight that god, and you

00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,810
know, it was my fault, like I did some

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,910
things wrong, and they took it out on you,

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,750
and I never got to thank you... but thank

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,750
you for dying for my sins.

00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,069
And I'm lad you're back. 

\krthiss That's not... I mean this...

00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,609
\donaar This seems like the right time to celebrate.

00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:05,430
\kthriss That's one interpretation, but I think

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,020
I'm just a person with some knowledge to

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,019
share, and that's all,

00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:12,810
basically.

\donaar That's what a messiah would

00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,849
say!

\kthriss Yes thank you 

\kate Rosie also as she

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,290
heard this, and she's like, 

\rosie You know, I

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,340
wanted to apologize that it took us

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,750
three days to resurrect you. We could

00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,810
have gotten... we could have gotten to that

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,930
a lot faster. 

\donaar Was it musty in that cave?

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:29,790
\kthriss Yes, very.

\someone Evelyn pops up and she's like,

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:35,370
\evelyn But let's remember that the true meaning

00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:37,500
of K'thrissmas is Lathander! The light of the

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,929
Morning Lord shining upon us, even in the

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,429
hour of our darkest need.

\holly Strix opens

00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:45,419
the door to the kitchen and says,

\strix I thought it

00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:47,909
was presents!

\someone Paultin goes to K'thriss, he's

00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,949
like,

\paultin I appreciate the concept of you, but

00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:52,110
I don't think anyone can prove you

00:08:49,950 --> 00:09:01,040
exist.

00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:01,039
\kthriss Oh doubting Paultin. 

\someone look at my scars,
\dm Gaze ye..
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:12,569
\kthriss Look at these holes here. Here. Also here. Here. This one. Big one over here.

\anna K'thriss would get so

00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,309
into that. If Paultin said this to

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,620
K'thriss, that no one can prove that he

00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:18,779
exists, like K'thriss's eyes would --

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,830
all 25,000 of them -- would just like

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,209
suddenly turn inward. Like, can they?

\kris Yeah,

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,590
he would have to come get comfortable

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,389
with that idea cuz, I mean you can't

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,330
prove any of this is real, but since I

00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:33,980
can't, and it seems to hang together,

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:36,540
let's just do what we can with this space.

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:42,149
\nathan Partway through like his talking, Paultin's

00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:43,829
already walked off. He's like 
\pautlin Welp, I opened a can of worms.

\dm It may not

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,809
matter to K'thriss. I suspect it'll

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,820
continue.
\kthriss It's just proof in one

00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,719
column or the other. It's like, okay, that _could_

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:55,379
mean I don't exist.

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:57,120
You just wandered away, _as if I wasn't here_. If he

00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,149
gets a K'thrissmas card, does that prove he

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,220
exists? Wow, I don't know that's like,

00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:10,230
empirical... it's, you know, the plural of

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:11,820
anecdote is not data. 

\holly So they pies, that Strix is baking in the kitchen, are they burning or

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,379
do they smell good? Should I like guess?

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,010
\dm You should roll.

\holly I don't know, I guess

00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,830
I'll roll. Okay. What's the DC check for...?

\dm You just roll, and I'll

00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:22,319
tell you if something terrible happens.

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:34,050
\kate What's the roll?

\ryan Tell the podcast

\dm It's an nine.

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:35,580
\holly So I should get like a skill bonus to that, shouldn't that be like Survival?

00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:44,819
\dm Yeah, these are survival pies, like a

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:47,460
Clif Bar. 

\holly This is adding my skill, my charisma bonus.

\dm Absolutely. This role

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,680
of a nine, plus your bonus, means that you

00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,860
can make an _edible_ pie. Okay it's... it's

00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,239
not toxic. 
\holly Okay, good. 

\dm There's no spores of

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,919
any kind of growing on there, unless it's

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,750
a spore pie.

\holly So it smells good?

00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,309
\dm Oh yeah.
\holly Okay. 

\dm It's it's something that

00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,759
someone would want to eat on purpose.

00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,309
\holly Okay.

00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,399
\holly Yeah so I bring out the first pie, and I

00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:08,039
put a bunch of little candy eyes in it.

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,009
So just covered in little tiny red candy

00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:13,949
eyes, and I put it down and go like

00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:16,500
\strix Everyone, it's the K'thrissmas pie, I guess.

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,910
\jared As soon as she brings it out,

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,669
I'm not sure if anyone notices, but Diath,

00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:22,139
right away, is super eager for

00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:24,179
it, but doesn't want to be the first

00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,759
person to cut the pie, and take the

00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:28,319
first piece. So he just is always looking

00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,759
over his shoulder like, is anyone else

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,890
do it yet? Is it okay for me to do it

00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:38,009
yet? Is anyone...?

\anna There's a tradition that before the first piece of K'thrissmas pie, we have to

00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:40,379
sing the K'thrissmas carol! Paultin did you

00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:42,809
finish writing it yet? 

\paultin Yes, all rise

00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:46,259
for your K'thrissmas national anthem. 

\anna Evelyn

00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:49,259
places both hands on her heart.

\nathan Paultin

00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,899
takes out his mandolin, and he's

00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:55,049
just like, 

\paultin Wait, shit, I had something. Hold

00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:58,189ß
on. Wait no, I have it on my...

00:11:55,049 --> 00:12:16,599
no wait, no, phones aren't a thing. Okay...

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:19,370
He plays a chord and just hands it back to you.

\evelyn \direct{Singing} It's K'thrissmas time!
And K'thrissmas pie!
We say our thanks...!

\paultin Thanks dude!

\evelyn ... so we ... don't be rude!



00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,350
[Laughter]

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:31,409
Dude, even though you may or may not

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:36,060
exist, how many eyes they have so we make

00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:40,159
the pie as easy have and Strix already

00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:43,829
has a piece ready for do you thank god

00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,480
she already knew she was like here, and

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,980
then she just sets it down the table.

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,360
It's all cut perfectly with a perfect

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,370
piece for everyone. It's like the only

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,190
neat thing she can do is this baking.

00:12:50,370 --> 00:13:01,409
mm-hmm nice yeah that's and it's very

00:12:53,190 --> 00:13:03,420
good. Donaar takes the whole pie. gets

00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:07,429
the first size now I just take a slice

00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:07,429
out of these are personal pies

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:26,360
to share these are our pies. This is not

00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:30,039
calories. The spirit, the true meaning of

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,039
K'thrissmas would be to make everyone a pie

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,970
big boy

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:41,270
Everyone here is causing my brand

00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:45,469
you had an invented a god. Yeah that's my

00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,939
issue with these forces. Oh, we made

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,950
a god, does that mean it gets more

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,959
powerful the more we talk about it? It

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,028
shouldn't work that way, but I know that

00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,769
it does for some. Yeah, they're intruding

00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:56,629
on your IP. You could like take action on

00:13:54,769 --> 00:14:02,509
that man. Legal action yeah help you with

00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:05,208
that I pitched this, so I get 10%. That's

00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:08,000
true. You can have 90% for all I care.

00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:10,449
Wow that's you can have 90%, that's it.

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,009
leads it 10 more than what I said

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:19,160
um Upset at this, I stalk up to my room

00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,490
to study, and Ike I'd come right back

00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,620
down.

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,329
My room is empty all of these

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:30,649
decorations. This was just stuff that I

00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:31,819
own. Hearing that Diath looked at the

00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,200
one of their crate that he's about to

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,610
bring over to Rosie and then looks over

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,540
at evil and it's like where did you get

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,278
this? yeah

00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:43,269
K'thrissmas has made out of keturah stuff

00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:46,458
you said you found this in the closet. I

00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:48,230
think it was a closet at one point. I'm

00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:58,159
gonna be honest, I only put a little bit

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:59,659
of his hair in the pie. It's good. You

00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,639
broke all of his staff Esther sculptures

00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:03,559
to make the glass. like that You don't go

00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,458
too heavy on ya know, it's just like a

00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,669
garnish on top.

00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:10,099
It's an art. cause I took a K'thriss just

00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:12,049
says you're... you seem upset, buddy. But

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,180
remember after we fought the god and then

00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:16,578
Donaar places his left hand, which has this

00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,458
awesome future techno-glove.

00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:21,769
\donaar Remember when we fought the Technomancer

00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:24,250
this awesome gauntlet afterwards? It

00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:25,490
shoots lasers. Yeah it does like laser

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,230
td8

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,389
oh I'll show you Oh

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,190
he ate That was a great battle. why are

00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:34,819
you so quick. I remember you

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,530
asphyxiated Tiamat with it, just each neck in turn.

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,150
You just went...\direct{imitates the sounds of breaking a series of necks} We've had great adventures

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,659
together. I understand why you're so

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:40,879
upset.

00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:43,850
\strix These people are barmy. So I'm gonna go

00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,039
back to the kitchen, where things make

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,139
sense. Yeah, where things make sense.

\anna Evelyn

00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,939
goes and sits on the floor cross-legged,

00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,379
next to wherever Rosie is. 

\evelyn It's like

00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,040
Rosie, I bet you've seen a lot of

00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:57,200
K'thrissmases.
\rosie This is, um, the second one.

00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,439
And it is wildly different from the

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:05,450
first one. 

\evelyn I bet you have so many

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,640
K'thrissmas stories. 

\rosie Oh, of course. I would

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:11,600
love to.

\evelyn Does it have a good moral to it?

00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:15,080
And a hero? Yep, the tradition of

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,330
everything I hold dear of K'thrissmas. Yes,

00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:23,990
gather round. I am gathered.

\rosie ...and I will

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:29,480
cook Okay okay so the story of the first

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:35,180
K'thrissmas, by K'thriss Drow'b. All

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:38,930
hail. Once there was nothing at all, and

00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:41,659
then there were other things. But the

00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:45,919
nothing still mattered more to me, K'thriss

00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:51,409
Drow'b, and I longed for it. And then

00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:55,699
my friends ruined all of it, and now

00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:58,850
I am so surrounded by people, and it is

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,430
nothing like what I had hoped for in my

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:12,529
very old age. Well that's my favorite

00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:14,569
cause Laurie loved Rome during this

00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:19,069
story I'd imagined again with a crate of

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:20,389
K'thriss's stuff she brought over to Walnut

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,269
at this point, but they both have the

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,009
same face listening this story I've just

00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:28,910
we're both like listen listening India's

00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:31,339
just like, This is bullshit honest we

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,019
agree. I'm glad we could finally agree on

00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:35,629
something. It's true.

00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:39,259
I don't celebrate holidays outside of my

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,400
order, and certainly not this. Yeah I mean,

00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:45,509
I don't really care either, but

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,730
miss Evelyn happy, Strix gets to make

00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:50,430
pies, Paultin gets to drink and it's

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,890
acceptable you around this time of year

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:56,549
but I guess distractions have their

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:59,070
place. I think Paultin would try to just

00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:02,250
walk past here and throw a wrench into

00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:03,659
things. Sure. Be like, 

\paultin Hey Walnut do you

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,529
think Omin got his invitation ticket?

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,080
versus 
\walnut Well, I sent him several, so I'm

00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:11,519
sure he's due to arrive any minute now.

00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,539
\trystam And you've noticed that

00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,809
actually, she's been looking at the

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:19,319
window like every time.

\walnut It would be rude

00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:21,269
if he didn't. I'm sure he's busy.

00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,829
He's got so much stuff that he's doing.

00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,700
\paultin Yeah, if I had to guess, he probably

00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:29,299
already decided that you're not

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:32,190
important enough.

\holly the kitchens like

\strix Snap!

00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:40,829
For the podcast listeners, my

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:44,789
mouth is agape. 

\paultin That's nice. 

\walnut Yeah it was

00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:46,470
nice. They're laminated.

\paultin Yeah I'm sure it

00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:48,029
was nice, I'm sure felt good, but I have

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,650
to ask like when he wrote to you, is it

00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,149
because he needed something from you, or

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,830
was he just trying to talk to you?

\walnut He did

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,990
need something, very important. 

\pautin Writing me

00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:57,659
always because he needs something, hmm

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,460
\walnut Well, I'm here to provide as a you know

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,460
employee of Acquisitions Incorporated -- I

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,579
don't know if you remember Walnut Dankgrass

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,860
Documancy ring - yeah I remember

00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,349
I just read I hope at some point that

00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:13,339
you can see value within yourself, that

00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,339
isn't in service to another,

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:32,089
Walnut Dankgrass. I've seen Paultin's

00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:35,000
cutting the pie real deep. The table

00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:39,199
splits into the laminate

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:45,710
\strix You broke my pie pan! That's my staff! Now

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:54,110
you have now you have to I do mend it.

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:59,329
I'm man thank you you don't get to

00:19:54,109 --> 00:20:00,829
contextualise miracles I fix things 

\holly I'll

00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:04,220
turn my in the pie pan back into my

00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:06,609
staff and be like

\strix yay 

\kthriss See, why is that

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:13,519
not a miracle? I was impressed. 

\guy Because

00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:14,839
_you_ didn't do it.

\guy I go in the kitchen I'm

00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,289
gonna go in the kitchen wait no, but

00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:26,389
that's my kitchen. I follow. It's actually

00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:28,159
not your kitchen this might work so you

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:32,330
follow Strix you want you want to

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,759
escape the, the _revelry engine_ that's

00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:37,399
currently yeah in operation in the

00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,829
great room. yeah and I say,

\kthriss that this is...

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,269
people just want to celebrate. They don't

00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:43,069
need a _holiday_ to do it, they should just

00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:45,589
do it if they want to. They don't need an

00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:49,279
excuse. Here, within the space of an hour,

00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:54,500
they have invented a figure to celebrate,

00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:56,299
and that's the entire thesis there to be

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,519
honest.

\strix I just celebrate waking up every

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:02,899
day. Cuz you could just die any day. you

00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:10,730
can also celebrate you're in here Paultin

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:12,140
I mean no the conversation here was a

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,099
lot more interesting, so I inserted

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:18,170
myself.

\paultin What up. that's hype Paultin hey

00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:20,599
hello I agree I agree you don't need a

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:23,090
reason to celebrate, you just the the

00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:25,459
reason to celebrate one celebrate which

00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:28,309
is you know or is like drowning sadness

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,930
man, whatever you need I believe in you.

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:31,230
We all do. And that's the meaning of

00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,808
K'thrissmas!

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,999
[Laughter]

00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:37,759
\kthriss Why drown your sadness when you could

00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:39,980
drown _in_ sadness? I've just experienced

00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,980
it, and just deepen it, and think about it.

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,269
I'll maybe write a paper.

\guy Paultin like

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,860
puts his head in his hands. He's just

00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:52,849
like, oh this is this is why he's the

00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:54,408
meaning of Strix just like starting she

00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:55,819
like turned her staff back into a pipe

00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,169
and just starts making another pike

00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,759
she's just like, I don't know I can't

00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:00,159
deal with this but she's like if there

00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,909
is maybe Have you ever met a power

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:07,970
before?

\kthriss Power? 

\walnut Yeah, like a god.

\kthriss I've met

00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:10,580
beings that _say_ that they're gods, but

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,079
I'm not met they're not _really_ gods, cuz

00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,519
anyone can become a god. It's just like

00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,868
you know, you roll over one day, and

00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,399
you're like, "I just want to become a god,

00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:18,288
that'd be great", and then you just, you

00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:19,668
know, find a way to do it. Maybe eat

00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:21,349
another god or something, and then you

00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:23,149
begin my god. Right, but then if that's...

00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:25,038
but then we don't know _why_. We don't know

00:22:23,148 --> 00:22:27,829
why any of this exists, if everybody just

00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,749
ascends, what was the first instance? who

00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:32,509
is there exists so then I can feel

00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:35,929
things like sadness, and feel things like

00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:37,819
K'thrissmas?

\kate Rosie enters the kitchen. She

00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:41,179
doesn't say anything, but she opens the

00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:44,408
oven where she has tentacle-shaped rolls

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,970
filled with jam. Where those come from

00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:49,429
yeah that's they've just finished baking

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,579
they look they look amazing 

\kate They have

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,590
little suckers on them that are

00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:58,730
intimately crafted. She offers you the

00:22:54,589 --> 00:23:00,918
first one. You can break it open, red jam

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:06,470
will pour out of it.

\kris I say,

\kthriss This is a...

00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:08,090
delicious outrage. there you It's just

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,860
exactly the reaction I'm she was hoping

00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:11,209
for.

00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:14,359
and she trucks the rest of them is she

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,100
gives a strict sort of a half dark but

00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,769
half curious look, because the pie

00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:20,778
situation was really rough but the pies

00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:22,128
are not delicious, and she knows that

00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:24,618
there's a lot of non-organic ingredients

00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:26,959
that are going into these pies, but I

00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:30,288
can't help loving that flavor you know

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,720
so she's you don't she's learning. She's

00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:34,190
she hates it, but she's learning the

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,319
Reese's he's like perfect little

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,538
pastries and they're just so like lovely

00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,210
and good looking that like you've never

00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:45,220
seen her like _bristle_.

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:49,900
[Laughter]

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:52,240
back arch will offer one districts right

00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,660
she takes it so like it's on fire.

00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:19,539
There's no hair in it. There _could_ be!

00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:23,380
There could be. In the kitchen and the

00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:26,680
kitchen is not larger than this size

00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:30,280
This is a small country inn. The kitchen

00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:35,710
is designed for one perhaps one elf and

00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:37,509
one halfling to function perfectly above

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,120
everyone with their flying boots making

00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,440
a song about the K'thrissmas because well

00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:44,879
they're all in there I want to hop back

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,380
to the death Walnut yeah yeah that

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,660
finally I think finally the rest of this

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,730
situation has moved away there may be an

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:58,570
opportunity for something approximating

00:24:51,730 --> 00:25:00,220
an authentic conversation. Yeah From your

00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:02,559
previous con indie it's kind of see that

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,450
and actually like almost regrets a

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,819
little bit and looks back at Walnut and

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,470
he says,

\diath I'm sorry. I did I did not mean

00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:10,389
to say that as mean to like cut or

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,190
belittle you, because I've seen we've

00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,470
done things before like I've seen the

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,539
way that you fight, you're so powerful.

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,850
It's incredible and I've heard the

00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:20,619
stories I've heard from others about the

00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:22,869
people that you care about and what

00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:26,079
you've been through and that's that's

00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:30,219
important so I just I just think you

00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:34,059
need to know that you are important, just

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:38,319
by yourself and people value for you. If

00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:39,069
you wish to serve Omin, that's great that

00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,349
makes you happy

00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:44,169
sure but I just well, I I think you

00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:48,250
should know that you don't _need_ that or

00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:51,039
him to have value.

\walnut There was a time in my

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:54,220
life where I did not have purpose and

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,730
Acquisitions Inc was that for me and I

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,009
can't

00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,019
lightly forget that and Omin made that

00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:06,700
possible and I'm in his debt

00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:12,819
\dm Yeah, asshole. How many levels of Documancy are

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:16,240
there? This is the future oh yeah sorry I

00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:18,970
mean yeah well I'm Rank Five now but

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,079
so she looks at him and now just like a

00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,960
little taken aback that she revealed

00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:26,558
anything of herself to him um and she

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:30,250
goes,

\walnut Truly, why why do you hate Omin. so

00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:32,379
much?

\guy Oh dear, I can't speak for a minute

00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,390
because eight billion things rush to his

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,160
head at once. He doesn't know which one

00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,070
to start with. and he'll just say,

\guy Because

00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,870
I grew up in Waterdeep. I wasn't born

00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:44,049
there, but it is where I grew up. It

00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:47,139
wasn't super pleasant and through those

00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:49,149
times I got to learn about all kinds of

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,059
different people. And it's because of

00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:54,250
that I know exactly the kind of person

00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:56,379
that Omin Dran is, and I know the kind

00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,299
of person that he pretends to be, and

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,910
what everyone sees. He's the kind of guy

00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:02,589
who what through whatever means, as long

00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:06,070
as he gets what he wants, that's okay.

00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:08,139
Whatever it means; destroying property, or

00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:09,789
taking whatever he wants, or stealing

00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,950
from others or using other people's

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,990
lives. The kind of guy who would purchase

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:24,190
a child for labor because it was

00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:26,679
cost-efficient. Podcast, Jerry is

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:31,650
literally grinning like a maniac, rubbing

00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,650
his hands 

\dm Oh, I am _actually_ doing it.

00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:35,710
\trystan Walnut doesn't really know what to do with that

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,710
information, and she goes,

\walnut Must be some

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:47,590
mistake. Well, or there's a good chance

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:48,670
we're both right. Let me go get you one

00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:52,599
of them tentacle thingies.

00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:54,460
yeah yeah sure sounds good. and yeah

00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:56,079
it'll go off and get like a treat. Two

00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,819
brave girls now it's like a sort of

00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,329
peace offering but it's a means to sort

00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:02,950
of like kind of smooth out.

\kate Rosie made a

00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:05,980
special one for a Walnut, that it looks

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,890
like it is made of gravel and just

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,589
flavored nuts. yeah like a lot of nuts to

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,150
let herb during races yeah

00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:16,689
comes back is like I just found a patch

00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:18,070
of grass.
\trystan Walnut goes,

\walnut Oh sure, I have

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,659
something for you...
\trystan and she pulls out what

00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:21,250
looks like a three-day-old Goodberry,

00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:27,039
that's like half-smashed, and she's like,

00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:29,740
\walnut This is for you. oh my god right right

00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:34,079
three yes Strix d I've come into the

00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,079
kitchen to take a pastry that's not hurt

00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:39,908
ventilated look at your Rosie and then

00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,500
it's a little typical things and like

00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:42,940
back into hip and then back at her PI

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,839
and she just is like, standing there

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:49,419
shake Paultin's gonna walk out and he's

00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:52,389
actually gonna approach Walnut, and be like

00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:53,559
\paultin Hey can I talk to you for a second?

00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,690
\walnut Sure.

00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:58,869
\paultin Alright, cool. I just... there's just

00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,548
something I want... wait, hold on.

\guy And he

00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:02,798
like you see him just kind of like turn

00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:05,408
90, just looking directly at camera,

\paultin Is

00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,750
like is this pre- or post- Waffles Inc? I

00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,850
can't remember.

\dm Oh, it's gonna be post.

00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:13,200
it's post all right cool he's like,

\paultin These

00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:16,928
time skips are so damn confusing. Okay, I

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,360
know that you and me are definitely the

00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:26,230
stubborn character archetype--

\walnut \direct{immediately} I'm not stubborn.

00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:28,569
saying it and I don't

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,009
ya know it's just a certain point when

00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:31,148
enough people say you gotta like, start

00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:34,000
doubting yourself and wonder, is that

00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:37,178
really me? But anyway, I know that you

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,730
and me, we've butted heads in the few

00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:44,048
interactions we've had, but I get it and

00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:45,548
I I respect your perseverance. It's it's

00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,859
something I see in myself. It's very

00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:51,099
admirable, and it was especially

00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:55,019
admirable when you came to and gave me

00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:55,019
the ring when I asked for it last time

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:07,120
you just like just like finger guns away

00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:07,659
some need our help to destroy the

00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,898
multiverse.

00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:13,419
yeah this well in hand apparently it's

00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:15,069
true 

\kate Rosie has this tray she's bringing

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,870
out these plates filled with these

00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:20,048
tentacle pastries she comes to you,

00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:21,908
Paultin, and she offers the plate, but

00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:23,889
before you can grab it, she pulls it away.

00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:25,040
She says,

\rosie I noticed you're not wearing my

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:29,780
sweater that I gave you.

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:31,460
\paultin Whoa
\rosie I mean, if there's one day a year

00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:33,410
but I would I would hope you'd want to

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,700
wear it, it would be today. well I'm glad

00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,060
I can wearing the sweater that I've made

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:43,400
for him which is especially shocking

00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:45,529
sweater 

\guy back in back in the Waffle House

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:51,860
there is a sweater in a drawer and

00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:54,049
Waffles nest Strix is stuffed with

00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:58,189
leaves that has been turned into a toy

00:30:54,049 --> 00:31:00,759
boy yeah so pan over there, and it's just

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:07,509
got bite marks and drool, blood on. it oh

00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:10,279
this is like sweater last kiss this is

00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:16,690
mm-hmm is this this is my first K'thrissmas

00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:16,690
I'm learning all the rituals. wait I

00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:25,669
know I got shoot I think this is so

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:31,340
embarrassing um God okay hmm He was

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:33,650
really blasted last year. We need to do

00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:35,959
our name-drawing this year oh yeah

00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:38,420
that's true, we do. Of course, the name

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,140
drawing, the K'thrissmas name drawing.

00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:44,420
As is tradition, I'm assuming? yeah and I

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:48,820
have luckily baked all of these

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,820
potential pastries with the name inside.

00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:56,779
\holly so mad about this that is a game she's

00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:58,490
just standing outside the kitchen just

00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:01,849
holding like her pie, and it's just like

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:10,309
really sad look he and she's like it's

00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:11,750
like the roof of the pie is just she

00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:13,940
just sets it down and then you just see

00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:17,299
her crawl under a table. 

\dm The top of the

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:20,630
pie, the crust is now _in contact_ with the

00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:22,430
filling. This is not a drill. Oh, no. 
\holly She

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,170
was too anxious and upset to make a good

00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:28,400
pie after seeing the beautiful pastries

00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:30,230
Rosie made. disturbing but now her but

00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:36,259
now Rosie's pastries also have some kind

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:38,329
of aargh in the exactly I think that

00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,929
Rosie would look at the pie and look at

00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:41,689
Strix, and

00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:44,330
look at Donaar I feel like I'm gonna

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,330
\donaar Don't gotta tell me twice. I would eat the entire

00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:50,689
thing as a well making it unbroken

00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:53,118
iconic garbage disposal. What does that

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,399
process look like? cuz he's got it he's

00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:58,398
got a massive body and a huge cross yeah

00:32:55,398 --> 00:33:01,428
it's like a little Hostess treat yes

00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,319
exactly right yes like a Ho-Ho it would

00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:04,038
be that and then starting to chew on

00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:10,509
the pie tin.

00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:10,509
\strix That's my staff!

\donaar It's great. No, great job!

00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:30,440
scraping no you did good! How many more compliments do I

00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:38,269
gotta give you? It's great. giant heavy

00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:44,088
cauldron 

\donaar Just keeps getting better! now

00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:44,888
it's like a hat yeah 

\donaar Greatest day of my

00:33:44,088 --> 00:34:06,878
life!

00:33:44,888 --> 00:34:06,878
thank you you're doing K'thriss's work.

00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:14,179
I've retired under the table, where you

00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:15,139
were trying to go, yeah and I'm just

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,898
meditating.

00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,278
I'm just muttering. I think you two have

00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:21,588
both gotten your pastries with your

00:34:19,278 --> 00:34:21,889
names in them. okay but here's the weird

00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:23,989
thing.

00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,700
when Walnut bit into her pastry, there

00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:31,368
were three slips of paper, and they all

00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:33,949
had Donaar's name on them. They all start

00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:35,599
eating our pastries, and every single pastry

00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:40,278
has at least one slip of paper and all

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,490
of them say "Donaar".

\donaar I got exactly who I

00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,489
want!

00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:55,079
[Laughter]

00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:57,630
\rosie That is _not_ what I put into these. oh wait 

\kris I come

00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:00,660
up and I be like,

\kthriss The tradition is

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:03,150
being established as we perform it. yes

00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:06,538
The tradition is now that we do a name

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:10,019
exchange, and Donaar is also the recipient

00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:14,579
of each person's gift. yes One for your

00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:28,348
Secret Santa and one for Donaar, and so

00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:32,759
shall it be. A little bit more powerful

00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:35,880
but it said hubris, maybe. That's all it

00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:39,119
is. Maybe it's just hubris and that's the

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,640
meaning of K'thrissmas! I think it is I

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,809
think it is. You guys are having so many

00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,219
breakthroughs, and you're ignoring them

00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:50,099
even is going around hanging the

00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:52,738
traditional thistlemoe, which you know

00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:55,048
as you know, when you stand below it yes

00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:58,559
you're supposed to give a warm hug to

00:35:55,048 --> 00:36:00,748
whoever you're standing under it with. She

00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,910
hangs one above Strix specifically, says

00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:07,498
give a warm hug. So this is like a

00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:10,469
ship engine, a device that creates and

00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:12,209
exports fully formed ships \marginnote{i.e. relationship} but it's not

00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:13,618
like she's not doing it like oh here,

00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,960
we'll put one here, and one here, she's

00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,509
literally like holy in Java she's like

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,970
grid creating the room looks like you

00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,858
almost can't _not_ stand under it because

00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:24,480
You can't move without hugging someone.

00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:27,420
so Diath is starting to like edge

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,969
between, moving through like you swear

00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,548
it's like him practicing Uncanny Dodges

00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:34,498
like lasers more or less going through

00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:39,538
Mission Impossible is like I know Evelyn's

00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:43,768
game just hugging Strix really tight

00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:45,150
and looking meaningfully at Diath it's

00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:47,189
like you don't want to hug someone who's

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,539
just totally limp mm-hmm so she just has

00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,329
like her arms the side in her head like

00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:53,460
this just like getting squeezed like

00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:55,030
it's just Evelyn is really strong so you

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,849
squeeze like really

00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:03,070
she's just like, oh just like play dead,

00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:05,650
maybe she'll go away. And then once like

00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,360
does Evelyn ever stop?

00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:13,360
not until Strix makes their probably

00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:15,700
okay 

\holly She turns into rats. 

\anna Evelyn looks

00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,650
downcast but then she she has like ten

00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:20,049
more of these thistlemoe sprigs and

00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:22,000
she just like smiles, and starts going

00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,650
about the room doing that secretly to

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,480
try to make more and more hugs. faces I

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,309
imagine at the same time everyone forgot

00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,090
about decorating so Diath took it upon

00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:31,320
himself. So it's done very poorly.

00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:33,460
[Laughter]

00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,350
glass-like just kind of grabbing a

00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:40,179
handful of stuff and just tossing it out

00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:42,759
like this toothbrushes like, it is

00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:44,679
garbage for sure, but also like a lot of

00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,810
books like really not colorful ones

00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:51,119
either, but they're being they're being

00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:53,099
displayed about like ancient like

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,170
thousand-year-old books

00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:59,500
stuffed with forbidden knowledge, just

00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:01,720
strewn about a great hunt a great room

00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,630
or wrapped up in paper with a tag that

00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:11,230
says Donaar yeah just like nailing them

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:14,740
to the whole room takes like a very

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:16,599
strong occult best of it all it's

00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:18,609
getting really weird I'm like the Tetra

00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:23,309
nomicon - it's like these these like

00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:26,410
sketches of like these bloody handprints

00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:28,929
a Turner staff and she has a green ink

00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:30,969
quill pen that does magic ink everywhere,

00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:32,589
entry signs yeah and she just starts

00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:33,939
drawing symbols on the wall and

00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:38,380
she's like,

\strix I love this; this is my

00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:40,329
aesthetic and like weird thing humans

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:44,890
will never get in here now writing like

00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:47,440
an Infernal and this one says but I like

00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:50,829
K'thrissmas and Infernal do you like that

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,010
What level of Documancer are you?

\strix I don't

00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:55,719
know. I just speak to the devil words oh

00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,610
all right. Well, that's good too. as well

00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:00,219
that's talking from behind she gets like

00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,670
me majorly squeezed hula from England

00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:02,669
she's like your

00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:12,750
they feel that on my skin and shake

00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:21,119
She weasels her way out. As a weasel does.

00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:23,369
She scampers away and she's just like

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,470
like all tense. like a very

00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:27,568
little anxious weasel. Do you come do you

00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:30,389
emerge from the bottom of the hug, or the

00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:33,029
top? Like how do you how do you like that

00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:36,179
\strix She just drops like a little brick yeah

00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:38,339
\dm So it is about this time that Profita

00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:40,889
Dran, the proprietor of the Dran and

00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:43,769
Courtier, returns in the front door with

00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:45,659
baskets of produce and items that are

00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:50,818
required for the running of a known

00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:53,909
occult inn, and as she pops in, she

00:39:50,818 --> 00:39:56,159
says,

\profita I want this to look

00:39:53,909 --> 00:40:00,269
something like the Dran and Courtier

00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:03,409
again in an hour.

\dm and she turns on her

00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:03,409
heel and walks away.
