00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:15,939
\dm Shadow Council, may our labors please

00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:19,389
you! Let me introduce your servants: to my

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:21,989
right, Dragonborn narcissist: Donaar

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,989
Blit'zen!

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,489
\StageDir Jerry sees the huge sword Ryan is holding
Where are you gonna fucking put that?
\ryan This is for you.

00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,750
\dm Is it- we'll work it out later,

00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:46,429
just set it down.

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,500
Nobody trip on it -- there's

00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,500
a huge sword. To the right of my right,

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,340
repping the natural world: Walnut Dankgrass!

00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,340

00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:14,789
You got your level two Documancy bag

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:18,990
in tow? 

\trystan Of course.

\dm Very nice, very nice.

00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:22,689
To my left -- not your Grandma's Grandma,

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:27,719
except in those rare cases where she is

00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:27,719
your Grandma's Grandma: Rosie Beestinger!

00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:46,638
To the left of my left, emerging as though

00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:46,638
from a mist shroud: K'thriss Drow'b!

\StageDir Kris enters stage right, dressed as K'thriss -- skin painted blue, blindfold over his eyes, and carrying his staff.
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,689
All right, now sometimes when I sit on my

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,699
massive cloak of rat flesh, I

00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:12,079
progressively slide down lower and lower

00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:14,879
in the chair, like a water slide.

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,250
Ultimately, my suspicion is that within

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,250
two and a half hours I will have slid

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,090
under the table, and will be in the front

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,919
row. 

\kris Where the game will continue! 

\dm I'm

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,659
gonna have a kind of gangster

00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,179
lean. Now obviously it's not gonna stop

00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,039
the game, I'm just saying if you could

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,060
just get a seat open for me there in the

00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:39,750
front for me to continue running the

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:44,659
game as per usual. 

Gathered friends, are

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,659
we ready to begin season two of the C-Team?

00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:54,169
\ryan Is there a bathroom break?
\dm Alright, there is not a bathroom break,

00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,920
but I suspect that some of these

00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:03,079
fabrics are deeply absorbent.

\ryan You

00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:09,049
won't even know! 

\dm Exactly -- all this, it's

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:12,830
just gonna grease my path to the front row. 

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:16,790

Indeed now, friends, heed my words.

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:20,509
You may recall that there was

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:24,410
a brief period in a place, a grove in

00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:27,879
Triboar, where the veil between the worlds

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:32,090
is very, very thin indeed. It is a place

00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:35,839
where Gwaeron the Hunter and Mielikki

00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:39,168
hold sway. It is a small grove called

00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,888
Gwaeron's Slumber. It is a place where

00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:45,589
K'thriss could not physically gain

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:48,829
entrance, such were the powers that held

00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:54,619
sway there. 

And there was a moment of

00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:57,199
intimacy of a sort, between Walnut and

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,100
K'thriss, where Walnut fashioned a

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,319
kind of natural couch, and then you were

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:08,570
heaped upon one another, and there was a

00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:14,329
cradling motion. 

Now imagine that our

00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:16,459
scene opens there, and let me give you

00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:19,279
some more details about what is

00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:21,589
occurring in this place. 

\kate Please do!

\dm Very

00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,259
briefly, let me give you the container

00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:28,779
object that we will use -- imagine if you

00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:33,170
will--

\kate I will.

\dm --the wedding of

00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:35,799
Brahma Lutier and Walnut Dankgrass. 

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,230
[Applause]

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:43,730
\kate Hold up, wait a minute!

\dm Your visions

00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:47,900
getting blurry? 

So in the very

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:53,780
center of this grove, you can see almost

00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:55,879
a diorama of the grove itself. So imagine

00:05:53,779 --> 00:06:00,049
there's a smaller version of it in the

00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:06,199
center on a wide dais, and imagine that

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:09,889
it is composed entirely of cake. There is a cake

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:15,199
grove in the middle. Off to the

00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:21,229
side, there is a beaming Grela Pretor, 

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:25,009
a famous baker of Triboar, slapping

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,980
children who come too close to the cake.

00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:30,230
They are not allowed to eat this cake

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,379
yet, and in fact she may never allow

00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:37,370
someone to eat it. This cake is

00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:40,009
the apex of her baking career, and

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,699
she may do her best simply to bring it

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:47,990
home with her at the end.

00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:51,229
K'thriss, you still cannot gain entrance to

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:54,699
this grove, which is full of people -- your

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:59,060
friends, everyone you know -- maximizing

00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:03,259
their revelry potential in a context

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:07,819
where fun has clearly been set to 10. But
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:13,490

on occasion, your Little Mouth, your tiny

00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:16,699
servant Ligotti, sneaks in, gives the cake 

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,860
wide berth -- he has been taught, he has been

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,800
instructed by Greta not to try to nip

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,770
this cake, not to try to dominate this

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,340
cake in his way -- but he occasionally

00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:32,029
succeeds at bringing you empty glasses --

00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:36,129
that _were_ full of wine when he

00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:40,299
originally secured them -- and wet,

00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,300
partially eaten, bits of cracker.

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:51,420
\kthriss As I requested. Good boy. 

\dm So he is doing his

00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:54,779
best to make you feel incorporated into

00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,900
these proceedings, but understand that it

00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:00,449
is in the moments before a wedding; it's

00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,649
very much like

00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:06,719
the hour before an oncoming storm:

00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,939
there's a lot of tension, a lot of

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,320
movement. You can almost smell the

00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:16,079
crackle of ozone in the air. But you have

00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,800
some faith that things will go according

00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,859
to plan,

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,930
because in your deep wisdom, you have

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:28,560
assigned Team Naiad's Fenn, their 

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:31,410
classic, dangerous Obviator, a person

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,349
whose primary skill is defeating

00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:39,509
impossible obstacles, as the Director of

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:42,629
Security for this wedding, and so she is

00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:45,120
occasionally coming up -- she is trying to

00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:47,480
leave you alone as much as possible -- but

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,509
Rosie, she is often approaching you and

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,830
Donaar with questions about how things

00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:58,019
should proceed. 

\kate Good.

\dm She has got

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:02,009
real questions about how things should

00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:03,840
go. Most of what she

00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:07,259
needs to do at this place can be

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,000
accomplished simply by a stern look. You

00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,840
can see that wherever she goes, there's a

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,679
kind of beam that hastens activity. No

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:20,490
one wants to get on Fenn's wrong side. So

00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:23,609
she approaches you and asks you if you

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:29,779
know where -- and then she pauses in the

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:36,240
middle -- she says, 

\fenn your _novel, effective son_

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:38,459
is.

\rosie Oh boy. Effective? Are we talking about

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,950
the same son? 

\fenn I have been reading a book

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,400
about being diplomatic.

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:47,720
[Laughter]

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:52,309
\rosie Well, that's very generous of you. You're

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:55,700
not talking about _Driebus_, are you?
\StageDir She whispers as she says his name.
\fenn I need to know where

00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:57,889
Driebus Beestinger is, because you told me

00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,430
that he could be entrusted with the

00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,230
rings.

00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:02,449
\rosie Okay.

\fenn And I trusted you against my better

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,720
judgment, and now I don't know where he

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,028
is,

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,210
and I don't know where the rings are. 

\rosie Don't

00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:22,389
worry, I've got this. Don't worry about it.

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:22,389
**_Driebus Beestinger!_**
\StageDir She speaks commandingly.
\dm I don't see him.
\StageDir \driebus enters stage right, wearing a leather jacket over a My Chemical Romance shirt, with his bangs hanging over his eyes.

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:54,250
\rosie Well, it's about time. 

\driebus Hey mom.

\rosie Do you have

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,770
the rings?

\dm You can see Fenn's hand go

00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:03,159
for her sword, and then immediately think

00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:07,088
better of it. 

\driebus It's like you don't trust

00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:16,028
me or something, mom. 

\rosie It's like that.

00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:18,610
\driebus I am responsible enough to take care of

00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:20,620
these rings, mom. It's okay, everything's

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,480
fine.

\rosie \direct{turning back to Fenn} Everything's fine!

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,970
\fenn Driebus Beestinger, I want you to show

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,889
me the rings right now. I want you to put

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,300
them in your palm. Put them in the palm

00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:31,059
of your hand and show me these rings!

00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:32,679
Driebus Beestinger, know this: I am responsible

00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,869
for the physical security of this

00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,909
wedding, but I am also responsible for

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,909
the emotional security of this wedding. 
\rosie Word!
\driebus I

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,480
happen to know for a fact that it is bad

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:51,090
luck for anyone to see the rings before

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:52,740
the wedding. 

\donaar That's a thing!

\driebus Right?

\rosie Don't help him! 

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,170

00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:01,680
\dm You think that Fenn doesn't know if that's

00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:01,679
true or not. 
\kate Make a bluff check.

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:11,839
What _is_ your deception? 
\pat \direct{consulting his character sheet} I- where am I here?

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:22,250
\dm Fenn waits patiently while you look over your

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:24,279
shit.

\pat \direct{rolls die} Uh, fifteen? It's that one level of rogue.

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:32,269
\dm Yeah, yeah, exactly. \direct{rolls die}

00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:35,269
She says:
\fenn ...Acceptable
\driebus Thank you.
\dm and then

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:40,480
she pulls back and she approaches you,

00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:44,809
Donaar, and she says:

\fenn There is a woman at

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:50,000
the threshold of the grove. She has a

00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:54,319
child with her, but she also has one of

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,659
the seven Ancient Blades. I don't know if

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,010
it's a bad omen or not, but I wouldn't

00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:04,610
allow it at my wedding. I would like your

00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:07,429
authorization to allow her entrance. 

\donaar Well...

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:20,659
\dm She says that she is quite familiar with

00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:21,769
the wedding party 

\donaar It's good that you're asking as _vice_-head of security.

\ryan She's fine.

00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:25,939
It's fine. She's fine. Everything's fine.

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,820
\dm Her face does not

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,440
change an inch, and she backs away and

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,680
then you see her

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,490
trundle over to the edge of the of the

00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:41,719
gathered group and she allows Princess

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:46,220
Sorsha and Chronaar to enter. They are in

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:50,149
relatively plain clothes for an event of

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:53,810
this kind, but you are aware that their

00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:57,708
anonymity in cases like this is of vital

00:13:53,809 --> 00:14:01,669
importance. But they have done their best

00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:05,659
to enunciate the version of Chronaar 

00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:07,579
that is optimally wedding ready. It looks

00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:10,100
like, you can sort of tell, you've seen

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,930
these flowers from the area around here -- 

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,579
you can tell that flowers have been

00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:17,849
gathered from many places, perhaps on

00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:21,178
their journey to here, and then she hands

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,829
them to you and then curtsies, which you

00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:24,600
haven't seen yet.
\ryan I was going to say, is the first

00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:27,859
time I've seen them since--
\dm It's been, it's

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,860
been a while. 
\ryan Yeah.

\dm It's been a while.

00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:39,419
\ryan Well, I take them, and then I pick her up, throw her around, dad stuff.

\kate Wrestle her, pin her down, tickle her.

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,999
\ryan It's of like authority...

\dm No exactly, it

00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:44,519
becomes it becomes like a golden lion

00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:47,159
tamarin scenario very quickly, where

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,499
she's thrown up but then she finds a way

00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:52,139
to land a little bit out of the grip and

00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:56,790
then she is just trying to be unable to

00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:58,980
seize altogether. Uh, Driebus Beestinger, 

00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:05,269
you've got no fucking idea where these

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:09,389
rings are at all. You don't know at all.

00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:11,999
You know what a ring _is_. You have

00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:15,149
thought about this in great detail. You

00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:18,959
know that they are round and small, and

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:25,379
that you don't have them. 

\kate Two facts about

00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:26,969
rings. 

\driebus \direct{to K'thriss} I- I... You know magic? Like, you know, _magic_...?

00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:32,249
\kris You're like calling out to me to-

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,899
 like across the field.
 
\dm Oh, he's right

00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:35,850
at the edge-- you have

00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,139
pure access.

\kris You make eye contact and just

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:42,360
wave me down and I'll get on 

\kthriss Oh,

00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:45,558
young Beestinger, yes?


\kris have you

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,720
found a way to-- 
\driebus Jesus, mom, your friends are creepy as fuck!

00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:59,009
\kthriss That's not true... but now that I'm in your

00:15:48,720 --> 00:16:01,309
mind, what do you want? 

\driebus I, uh, I... have strong suspicions

00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:06,470
that there are... dark forces at play

00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:13,409
trying to sabotage this wedding. Um... powers...

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:18,749
that are looking to... perhaps, steal vital

00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:23,279
resources...

\kthriss Like blood? The bridal party's

00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:28,230
viscera?

\driebus Perhaps... but they've started with

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:35,789
the rings.

\kthriss Rings? 

\driebus The- the wedding rings.

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:43,139
Someone has used dark magicks to... to obscure

00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:50,189
them or, or, teleport them, or take them or...

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:54,689
make me put them down somewhere... 

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:56,790
You can't tell my mom, you can't tell my mom.

\kthriss I was

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,160
concerned about this from the beginning

00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:02,699
\driebus Right, right?

\kthriss I have a familiar who is

00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:07,680
shaped as a ring _holder_, and yet I was

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:10,828
not interested with these. Or permitted

00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:16,380
to get my own half-eaten scraps of

00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:17,938
cracker. What were you, what do you want

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:29,130
to do about it? Are these rings important?

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:31,830
\driebus Um, they _say_, yes. I thought

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:35,730
I thought sort of important? But

00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:37,349
apparently like, _super_ important.

\kthriss What

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,990
did they- what did they look like?

00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:42,480
Can I hustle some up real quick using

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,069
materials I find around the edge of the forest? 

\driebus Yeah, can

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,420
you do that? Yeah that would be great.

00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:50,399
\kthriss Probably.

\driebus Um, like, like yay big \direct{he holds his hands a little bit apart}, \direct{}her holds his hands a little bit apart}... Can you

00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,580
see it in my mind? No no, don't look at

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,169
that! Don't look at that.

00:17:54,169 --> 00:18:05,929
\kthriss Hold your hands up.

\driebus Hold my hands up? \direct{he holds his hands above his head}

\kthriss That big? Okay...

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:08,118
\driebus No no, it's like the finger rings ring

00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:10,759
ruff or off or a finger finger right

00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:12,918
yeah you do two rings yeah four

00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:16,849
different fingers of different people

00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,799
that's innumerable possibilities and I'll

00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:22,608
do what I can. I can just start making

00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:25,278
loops of grasses no mark no no there

00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:30,798
okay okay now don't think that suited

00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:34,220
why okay uh thank you. I really

00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:37,460
appreciate you consulting me on this

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,259
matter of grave cosmic importance. This

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,358
whole time by the way, Rosie is watching

00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:50,450
Driebus just like, standing, staring blankly

00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:55,220
hearing actress my turn yeah mom Jesus

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:59,019
make some noise sometimes 
\dm Can I get a

00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,019
real quick perception roll?

00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:11,469
13 
\dm You're obliterated. snow no you're not.

00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:14,109
You're not obliterated, but you don't

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,700
think if you don't remember, or consider

00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:19,629
even for a moment anything of

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:24,370
consequence please continue right right

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:26,440
I okay yeah thank you thank you if you

00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:31,359
see here's the thing maybe if you saw

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,309
shit yeah no here no kit here here here

00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,069
now let me let me add a piece of

00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:37,990
information, a piece of information that

00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:45,309
might be useful for you and the Shadow

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:48,849
Council to know: K'thriss can see perfectly

00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:51,879
well, but his eyes are not like the sorts

00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:52,589
of eyes you would like to look at. Where

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,050
eyes

00:19:52,589 --> 00:20:01,889
classically are on the sorts of people

00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:07,210
that we know, he has a spread of

00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:10,720
apparently random red jewels that fill

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,470
the entire socket, and then even spill

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,920
out slightly around the edge. gross

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,650
disgusting

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:22,600
pick it up show everyone know at this

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:26,940
time during this period of time K'thriss

00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:30,339
Drow'b can see with something

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,720
like an eye but on something 

\kris I don't

00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:33,399
_have_ to use Ligotti. something

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,220
eye-adjacent -- you can if you want to and

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,080
occasionally it's fun yeah 
\driebus Wow, so like

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,950
you've got like these magic gem eyes

00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:55,449
going on and I was thinking, can you...

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:57,819
\kthriss Fashion one of them into a ring? Yes, okay!

00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,759
like I went to the buffet real briefly

00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:04,750
like just one I just I just walked by

00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:07,750
the buffet I talked to this like half

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,420
elf girl and then I hung out with

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:14,049
right hand a little bit like I've been

00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:16,740
all over this place right but do those

00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:19,829
magic eyes you like see true

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,740
you can like. it Cuz you I'm assuming you

00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:24,990
have like massive oracular like all

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,390
vision
\kate You can't just ask people if they

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,390
can see through things!

\kthriss My field of

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:34,770
vision is slightly greater than that of

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:39,509
mere mortals. Where your field of view is

00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:41,099
like _this_, \direct{he holds out his arms to indicate how wide his peripheral vision is} mine's like \direct{he widens the angle of his arms very slightly}

I mean what

00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:44,009
peripheral vision mean wha it's

00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:46,709
incredible 
\driebus What I'm getting at is like

00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:51,299
Deus have you seen some rings around no

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:53,430
oh okay yeah now you think about where

00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:55,440
these rings might be. Think about the

00:21:53,430 --> 00:22:00,060
life you've lived. Think about the person

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,730
you are.

\dm Walnut Dankgrass.
\trystan It's me!
\dm Fenn

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:06,000
approaches you. She has been trying to

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:09,720
give you as much time as you need in

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,140
comfort. You have a small place away from

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:17,120
the festivities themselves. You're free

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:21,270
to mingle of course, but the grove has

00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:24,089
allowed you a private, special place.

00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:26,420
Indeed, you have a place that is distinct

00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:30,149
from Brahma's place. It has

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:34,680
constructed and made space for each of

00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:41,160
you before the handfasting. Now, when she

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:43,950
approaches, she hands you these flowers,

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:48,740
and you can tell immediately... Here, can I

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,740
get a perception roll? 

\trystan Uh, surely you can...

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:58,580
16 plus I don't know, where is it

00:22:53,369 --> 00:23:05,579
6 she's all flustered plus 7 so over 23

00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:09,149
\dm So, her eyes, the center core of them, yes

00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:12,659
are perfectly black and infinitely deep

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:18,360
and she says:
\fenn This is a gift from the

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:21,090
Shadow Council
\dm and then they

00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:23,849
return to their ordinary color, and she

00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:28,319
says,
\fenn Now, I have a warning for you;

00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:30,498
something to keep in mind
\walnut Okay...
\fenn There are

00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,599
creatures...

00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:37,649
unrelenting creatures, creatures of

00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:50,248
infinite hunger
\walnut Sure. 
\fenn ...who only hunt

00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:52,768
married people -- no one knows why but

00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:54,690
that's no one knows why, that's all they

00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:57,028
like -- and up until today, you've been

00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,288
perfectly safe from them, but from now on

00:23:57,028 --> 00:23:59,788
this is something you're gonna have to

00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:05,329
consider, and I just wanted to give you a

00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:09,419
heads up. 

\walnut I have a lot of questions.

00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:10,980
please okay Why have I never heard of

00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:15,720
these before? 
\fenn They're completely

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:18,450
invisible, ok inaudible no sense that we

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,740
know of, and what it could be here right

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,999
now. They could be waiting at the

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:27,450
periphery for the ritual to commence, and

00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:33,839
then just as we have feasted, they will

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:36,350
feast as well. Something to consider. I

00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:42,689
could hold them off for... a minute or two

00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:44,759
probably? I mean I think I think I could

00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,720
handle myself in a fight oh oh of course

00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,610
of course

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,649
\trystan oh and Walnut gets really serious, she

00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:54,148
goes
\walnut You are Director of Security. 

\fenn Oh,

00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:57,538
absolutely, absolutely.

00:24:54,148 --> 00:25:02,788
yes oh absolutely but I mean there are

00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:07,220
limitations. Silent, inaudible, invisible

00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:07,220
assassins? Who could blame me?

00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,509
\trystan So what, can I do a roll to see if I've

00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:13,519
ever heard of such a thing? or fine no

00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,628
yeah absolutely I do it Can I do insight

00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,440
to see if she's messing with me? yeah

00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:23,738
yeah yeah

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:28,909
\trystan Let's see... big money wha-wha-wha-what up

00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:35,598
\dm now she is as serious as she can

00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:40,369
possibly be. good God okay yeah exactly

00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:42,678
well so don't dull drama comes up from

00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:45,408
the side and she's like oh girl

00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,460
and then she's like then Fenn go kill

00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:54,039
something, go, just... move away.
\dm and she says

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:57,558
Walnut don't drama doc you buddies now

00:25:54,038 --> 00:26:00,588
obviously this you are about to enter

\dm There are rings that need to be

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,539
found during this. What's going on with

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,380
these rings?

00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:38,700
[Music]

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,460
the situation where you like look across

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,289
the group of people, and you see Fenn and

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,730
then she's always like locking eyes with

00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:46,730
you and starting to move towards you

00:30:47,130 --> 00:31:01,200
can I get a perception roll? maybe 12 no

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,049
you think you think very briefly about a

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,640
girl that you once showered in glass in

00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:09,899
Westbridge from us underway

00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:12,509
\driebus I remember her. What's the music like

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,090
here?
\dm There's not much are you ready to

00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:18,990
provide some?
\driebus No way that would be a

00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:21,269
great way to make up for losing... no one

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:30,299
would even think I could not 
\donaar I could get

00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:31,710
the band here! 
\dm yeah yeah exactly you two

00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,450
aren't allowed to talk anymore
\driebus That

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,960
dragon man -- I bet you he could play some

00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,809
bitchin bass.
\donaar I never have seen one but I

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,309
could. 

\person Don't know what it is 
\donaar I don't even

00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:43,049
know what it is, already an expert. 

00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:44,730
I'm the best okay 
\driebus I think pretty sure

00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:46,230
I've been to the buffet, like, four times,

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,549
so if the rings are gonna be anywhere

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,910
they're at the buffet. weight could be

00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:53,849
deep in the pie right at the box oh yeah

00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:56,519
I'll kind of circle the buffet like a

00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:58,409
like a shark. 
\dm Okay, give me a give me a

00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,750
perception roll. but yours you're

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:08,910
slightly scooting these trays of baked

00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:11,609
products around that's it 30:13 that's

00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:15,140
so low pretty much no it's it's

00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:18,119
insufficient. okay um as insufficient and

00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,610
somebody but you're you've adjusted like

00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:23,928
you have like

00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:26,269
deeply wounded that the chi that

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,820
surrounds this like, _meticulously_

00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:31,089
arranged table right your umbrella is

00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:34,159
over and she's just moving things

00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:39,439
micrometers left and right and she's

00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,779
like no no Rosie did your child 
\kate I'm on

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,250
you like a shadow. like I'm very

00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:46,250
suspicious of this whole thing. I don't

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,980
think he has these rings.

\guy I think that's a

00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,679
reasonable assessment. It is at this

00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:57,140
point that you start to hear something

00:32:51,679 --> 00:33:00,290
like wind chime, the wind blowing through

00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:03,110
the leaves of a tree, sort of in the

00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:10,548
middle distance and you can see it erupt

00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:13,909
in green flame and you can see a month

00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:16,730
and you can you can see the leaves take

00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:21,080
on a different sort of timbre and color.

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:24,289
it sort of flash like panes of glass and

00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:32,480
then a tree near erupts in the same

00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:33,940
flame. 

\guy what color it's shit holy fucking

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:46,799
shit

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:46,799
[Applause]

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,990
is that your rig does give you effect

00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,990
cloud

00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:04,619
\kate I'm disappointed in _real_ life. Dude, he

00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:07,080
keeps going back for more.

00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:09,480
like I don't know if it's an act, I don't

00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:13,739

\kthriss I don't do that. I pocket it.

00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:36,389
no you're not a tree yeah exactly so

00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:39,529
situated between the place that has been

00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:47,519
created for you and Brahma to prepare

00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:50,220
and get into the ritual space, there is a

00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:53,489
tree in the center of the grove that is

00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:56,519
now alight with that same flame, and

00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:59,250
every leaf on it is shining like

00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:03,389
a chunk of stained glass and it's just

00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:06,420
ringing like a bell and the tree itself

00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:11,339
the trunk unfolds almost like a

00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:15,059
flower opening, and from it steps grove

00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:18,300
keeper Malayan, who you have met in

00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:23,670
the past and she is perhaps the only

00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:30,230
person capable of manifesting the proper

00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:34,710
EPA ritual. When as she emerges she has a

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:40,380
arraignment of silver, and

00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:43,460
the crown that she wears recalls

00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:48,539
the destruction of the city of Mnemosyne.

00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:53,009
So there are great trunks of braided

00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:55,859
razor-sharp wire that erupt from the top

00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:58,769
of this crown, and then come down around

00:37:55,858 --> 00:38:02,159
and then at the base of it you can see

00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:04,919
that Nana's ear seeds are placed roughly

00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,828
every inch. This is a crown that

00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,200

\dm It's bad news. As she

00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:28,468
emerges and looks over to your place of

00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:30,478
preparation, and looks over to Brahma's

00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:32,579
place of preparation, and then looks out

00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:34,679
at all these other people, who she

00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:38,579
suspects are not sufficiently reverent,

00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:43,798

00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:46,048

\dm No,

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,890
you would know that. 

\pat Right, that wouldn't

00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:32,829
require a perception roll. 
\kate okay what does

00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:38,079

00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:58,449

00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,020
pretty low-key wedding you know the four

00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:10,440
will happen for you, for once. 
\pat We got 16 

\dm 16 is

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:13,060
enough. As you are walking

00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,990
toward the center of the grove, to what

00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:21,239
you are sure is your death, you feel

00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:21,239

00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,880

00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:37,210
it's happening right now so it's like

00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,489
while you're walking toward you sort of

00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:42,190
feel them shift in your boot.

\pat Okay right

00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:45,429
so I'm real casually like real cool I

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:48,639
keep going, but I take my boot off, so I'm

00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:51,279
kind of hopping like half way yeah half

00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,659
hopping but like but like... stealthy. I

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,460
will make a roll for that if you need me

00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:57,339
to...?

\dm No no it's all good

00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:59,869
\driebus Yeah and then I pulled the boot off

00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:03,680

attack the food table like raptors in

00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:54,360
Jurassic Park. I'm going to the other

00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,910
yeah

00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,870
Sorsha is just like trying to sort of

00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:59,429
like a racehorse

00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:01,710
oh yeah 

\kate I'm like just trying to put up a

00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:03,839
kind of psychic shield between her in

00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:06,119
this. She's learned it's not a productive

00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,620
way to spend her time trying to keep

00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,639
things like this from happening

00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:15,839
\dm bad fun dance mm-hmm and it's there's a

00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:20,730
few moments where you are the only one

00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:24,269
that has emerged, and if you think I mean

00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:26,420
perceptually -- it seems like millennia but it

00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:31,920
can't be more than a few seconds -- and

00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:36,599
when you see Brahma emerge, her blonde

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:41,329
hair has been folded into massive tight

00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:48,449
braids that sort of create the base of a

00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:52,860
black helm adorned with like ruthlessly 

00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:57,469
sharp antlers that come up and seem

00:44:52,860 --> 00:45:00,450
impossible impossible to wear and she is

00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:02,609
managing it with absolute

00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:06,029
professionalism. The rest of her

00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:09,780
arraignment is the exact moment where

00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:15,030
fall becomes winter. It is a kind of

00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:18,150
plate mail, all individual leaves, but not

00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:21,060
one type of leaf. It looks like the

00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:24,960
forest floor, and it is glinting in the

00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:28,259
late light here in this moment

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,230
as night is approaching and grove keeper

00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:35,160
Malayan looks at the sun that is

00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:39,900
attempting to dip its way below the edge

00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:46,259
and steal this moment and she points at

00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:48,809
it and says
\malayan You will not.
\dm and then she

00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:55,050
drops her hand and then she looks and

00:45:48,809 --> 00:46:00,679
she says,

\malayan The rings. 
\dm And then she gives

00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:04,320
you a ring, and she gives a Brahma a ring

00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:06,960
for you guys to place it and she says

00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:16,880
\malayan This is not our custom, but I understand

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:20,670
that the youth engage in it. 

\dm So Brahma

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,769
like, hands shaking, it's like trying

00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:25,470
desperately to find like the right

00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:26,730
finger like you know that in and she

00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:30,868
like looks at her own hand and then

00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:33,780
she's like listen my hands out and just

00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:36,809
use a hand to guide her and then turned

00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:39,599
her hand over and like in the only

00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:42,088
moment of stoical miss Wilma has ever

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,099
had just slides it on first try yes nice

00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:45,989
just like perfect like putting a mic

00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:50,250
like right in the yeah right in the

00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:51,838
ditch done and then she she grows keep

00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,179
her nail and watches this with some

00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:58,199
interest just like in an anthropological

00:46:54,179 --> 00:47:02,868
way, and then from her pouch she

00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:08,639
retrieves several feet of green and red

00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:13,588
silk cord and she brings them out, and

00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:18,329
then she she wraps them around your held

00:47:13,588 --> 00:47:22,650
hands, and they're loose --like, they're 

00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:27,960
sure and certain, but they're loose; you

00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:30,630
can still move inside the handfast-- and

00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,869
then she looks at you and says your

00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,869
words.

00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:47,670
\trystan oh man a lot of stuff in there I do many

00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:49,469
wonders so I look at Brahma and it's

00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:54,358
clear that I've prepared something, and

00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:56,189
I'm not as eloquent as most, but I look

00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:58,409
her dead in the eyes and I say

\walnut My words

00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:00,480
may not be sweet and my looks may not be

00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:03,750
fair, but I have loved enough to give and

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,969
a life enough to share 
\dm And then she says,
\brahma Same.

00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,969
yeah nice nice nice nice

00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:27,200
\dm She says saying she with she has this

00:48:23,929 --> 00:48:30,858
hand here, and then her left hand comes

00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:34,939
around and just seizes the back of your

00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:36,980
neck, and pulls you in. 

Would we like to

00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:39,858
find out how we got up to this wedding

00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:43,240
point? yeah let's investigate it and

00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:43,239
Driebus Beestinger, thank you so much.
\StageDir Pat Rothfuss waves to the crows and exits stage right.
\linebreak
00:48:52,550 --> 00:49:03,900
Oh got her yeah yeah you know, 

\dm So you

00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:07,409
have recently returned to the Dran and

Courtier with a new pet. Now my

00:49:07,409 --> 00:49:12,779
presumption -- you tell me -- my presumption

00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:15,059
is that you emerged from the jungles -- the

00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,550
hot and steamy jungles of coal salts

00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:21,360

00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:22,710
erotic a different kind of show! You know

00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,700
what I'm talking about. It's Acquisitions

00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:28,470
Incorporated _Nights_! not naive now I have my

00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:30,599
presumption is that you utilized your

00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:32,759
second-level cartography powers? 
\kate Correct.

00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,920
\dm So tell me the story that you told the

him we don't want any of that mess but

01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:19,329
he's outside he said something about

01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:22,000
Brahma's ring. He asked me if we'd fed it

01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:25,210
to Coriander. Yeah I thought it was like

01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:33,070

01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:19,610
but she is not going with you yeah I

01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:23,029
don't think she would what

01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:25,620
well then why are you looking for I

01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:28,140
you're not gonna believe me but I think

01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:29,789
that she's in a lot of trouble and I

01:06:28,139 --> 01:06:33,769
think that if I try to help her she

01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:36,090
won't let me and I think if I bring you

01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:40,909
maybe I'll get out of it alive no I

01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:40,910
don't want to be likeable okay

01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:53,219
additionally like whatever you come out

01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:56,130
he's like so no yeah oh yeah it wasn't

01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:59,819
even a fucking self

01:06:56,130 --> 01:07:01,619
but if him only you find her and but she

01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:04,620
sees that you're with us would she not

01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:06,869
run away I mean doesn't that it gets the

01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:09,989
whole point you should just send us to

01:07:06,869 --> 01:07:12,299
do it you don't know how to find her

01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:13,409
you can tell us and then we'll just do

01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,630

I mean when we go okay

01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:29,039

01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:32,579

to figure out what level he is it

01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,880
doesn't work that way

01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:53,639

as a group yeah

01:07:57,059 --> 01:08:12,389
Rhian - that was really good

get off this call Donaar 
\kthriss We can just

01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:17,068
destroy his mind. He'll be alive to kill

01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,859
him I like it

01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:22,410
oh boy yeah you see 
\dm You think you think

01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:25,588
that you think that you would win out

01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:28,380
eventually, but you don't know if you

01:08:25,588 --> 01:08:30,930
would all survive.
\trystan Okay. 
\dm But you think

01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:34,739
back you think back to what he's capable

01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:38,430
of in a small space, with just the two

01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:47,369
daggers right and it's not a good memory.

01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:49,230
It was like Jackson Pollock.
\walnut Okay I don't

01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:54,619
think this is gonna be a fight we can

01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:57,509
win yeah you think that he is stroking

01:08:54,619 --> 01:09:00,420
Coriander with something akin to

01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:05,789
authentic affection. I am immediately

01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:12,720
jealous you see him reach down into his

01:09:05,789 --> 01:09:16,439
pouch for a coin what a bastard

01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:19,740
it's getting closer I do it I reach out

01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:21,059
swat him with this with my staff Wow

coin that I'd made him drop and I feed

01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:56,560

get it and I put a hand on Ligotti and

01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:42,500
it's disgusting oh yeah that guy's a

01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:47,360
piece of shit

01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:50,029
[Laughter]

01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:52,789
so you're like body unconscious in the

01:11:50,029 --> 01:11:58,939
car no no hehe has sent him up he's like

01:11:52,789 --> 01:12:02,210
seated on the velour right smile smiles

01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:03,739
there and then it just like like one of

01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:06,079
those you push the bottom of the thing

01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:08,210
in the world all goes yep yeah so he is

01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:10,309
like like like an inchworm

01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:13,970
he has folded up on the floor of the

01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:15,500
cart yeah 
\kris Which would be fair if I was

01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:19,119
still in that body, I was that's what I

01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:26,779
probably anything to me

01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:28,909
looks like man like he do that yeah it's

01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:30,439
just normal commonplace that's just re

01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:32,569
how we get in the cart yeah I just like

01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:37,579
slide over and you just collapse right

01:12:32,569 --> 01:12:40,670
and he he opens up this slide to speak

01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:48,380
to you in the driver's chair mmm and he

01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:53,359
says,
\oak Supposedly she is in the Chapel of

01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:55,369
Lysander in Westbridge Oh North below it

01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,589
great i slide it back I don't need any

01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:58,819
more information from you and he was

01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:10,630
like I mean I think the best way

01:12:58,819 --> 01:13:14,420
probably all right we go I send you uh I

01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:16,690
send you a message via Ligotti it's that

01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:19,579
I think you can get there any faster

01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:25,699
involving a story maybe about how he

01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:27,559
falls out of the cart a lot I think that

01:13:25,699 --> 01:13:29,420
the trip to Westbridge is pretty short

01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,010
right that's not should I should I use

01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:33,350
the telephone 
\dm It would be a day

01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:36,560
otherwise. yeah they're fast

01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:38,240
all right all right so so tell me a

01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,970
brief story about how we get to

01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:45,649
Westbridge okay that can involve any manner

01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:49,490
of hijackers okay I leaned down to

01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:52,879
Coriander and I say
\rosie We leave with Oak in

01:13:49,489 --> 01:13:55,389
the back, but Oak has terrible diarrhea

01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:59,029
and

01:13:55,390 --> 01:14:02,329
we have to we have to stop 10 20 times

01:13:59,029 --> 01:14:06,349
for him to evacuate. At least we

01:14:02,329 --> 01:14:09,319
stopped it just feels 

\kris You can see in the

01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:11,030
glass window-- it's just like a meter but

01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:11,659
like at that point like that's

01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:14,809
impressive

01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:16,609
yeah yeah yeah I broke up on top of it

01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:18,530
yeah okay Wow

01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:20,299
yeah then oh and then there was there's

01:14:18,529 --> 01:14:22,369
one part we're almost to Westbridge, and

01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:24,010
a cart pulls up next to us, and it has

01:14:22,369 --> 01:14:26,630
it's filled with the most beautiful

01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:28,850
elves you've ever seen, and they

01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:32,359
look at Oak -- they can see him through the

01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:34,490
windows -- and they all barf simultaneous

01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:36,829
like a chorus yeah they just all like a

01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:41,210
vomit choir yeah and he's embarrassed,

01:14:36,829 --> 01:14:43,869
and and Oak starts to cry, and then we

01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,869
get to Westbridge

01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:56,549
\dm So you can see immediately as you

01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:59,038
sort of emerge, that sort of soap bubble

01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:01,619
has formed it around in the carriage

01:14:59,038 --> 01:15:03,840
house and you're seeing these images off

01:15:01,618 --> 01:15:06,889
to the right. You can see these beautiful

01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:11,389
elven maidens, their faces contorted

01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:16,199
with vomit. You can see the shit rise

01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:21,900
inside that finite space. You can see the

01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:26,698
placid face of K'thriss, like inert, but

01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:28,888
a grim smile. It's what you can tell is

01:15:26,698 --> 01:15:30,299
that it's new it's new information and

01:15:28,889 --> 01:15:34,078
he didn't have before and that is

01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:36,900
apparently sufficient. Now but as you as

01:15:34,078 --> 01:15:39,779
the bubble pops, you are on the road

01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:42,960
right outside Westbridge, and there's a

01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:45,840
cart behind you that has to pull

01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:49,439
back hard on the reins or else smash

01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:51,510
directly into Coriander's cart. You are

01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:54,268
pulling into Westbridge generally

01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:57,469
speaking you have driven either straight

01:15:54,269 --> 01:16:01,409
through Westbridge into the central

01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:05,788
courtyard where there at one point where

01:16:01,408 --> 01:16:09,420
two warring Inns with custom statuary

01:16:05,788 --> 01:16:11,518
now there is a single statue in the

01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:13,170
middle that we saw during the wedding

01:16:11,519 --> 01:16:16,230
that was unveiled but it has that sort

01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:19,679
of bizarre like that sort of comic book

01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:22,169
pose where it's like somehow the bottom

01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:29,760
somehow like the ass and the face are

01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:32,279
like both yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah

01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:36,360
exactly and say they found some way to

01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:38,969
make this you know show its best asset

01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:41,549
to each of these different places here

01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:43,980
in the middle it's a it's a contortion

01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:48,119
but they've done their best to make it

01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:50,158
have a semi human silhouette but like I

01:16:48,118 --> 01:16:51,899
say so before you've gone up there and

01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:54,149
then obviously when you were able to

01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:56,339
construct your wagon you had gone east

01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:58,439
on the stone road across the bridge

01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:00,900
you've also gone north from here to

01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:02,489
places like NEMA's ear generis there

01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:06,409
scholars even farther in

01:17:02,489 --> 01:17:12,689
earth here there is a new temple clearly

01:17:06,409 --> 01:17:17,460
a manifestation of the glory of Lysander

01:17:12,689 --> 01:17:22,979
the morning Lord here on torille this is

01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:26,970
this is not a this this is not a revered

01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:29,359
place this is clearly a place basically

01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:32,039
like this is where your tithes go

01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:35,519
functionally speaking this is it's like

01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:36,210
it's like the Scientology Center you

01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,820
know what I mean

01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:40,230
and it's a lot of people outside that

01:17:38,819 --> 01:17:44,069
wants you to think levander is the best

01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:46,500
and this new cathedral is just here down

01:17:44,069 --> 01:17:49,409
on the south to greet people who are

01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:54,869
coming up from places like Waterdeep on

01:17:49,409 --> 01:18:00,059
the long road and so as soon as you

01:17:54,869 --> 01:18:05,479
approach and open up the door Oak leaps

01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:08,850
out and he is looking with great intent

01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:10,589
at the building you can saw he's just

01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:15,780
sort of circling it trying to find

01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:18,480
something immediately after him like I

01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:22,349
want to be like yeah like right behind

01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:26,909
him just time me too yeah I was like I

01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:28,770
want to help so close and he's he is he

01:18:26,909 --> 01:18:31,819
has gotten like back around to the back

01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:34,800
like where the topiaries aren't quite

01:18:31,819 --> 01:18:36,479
where they should be right now it's like

01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,770
there so they're planning it's like this

01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,259
these these are the bushes that are

01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:42,960
gonna look great a couple years from now

01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:47,310
this is fresh fresh yeah exactly but the

01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:50,970
facade is exquisite and he is clear he

01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:54,180
is plainly frustrated as he is looking

01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:56,970
upon this what do you what are we

01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:59,970
looking for here it's a shape there's

01:18:56,970 --> 01:19:03,750
going to be a shape what kind of shape

01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:08,190
he's like ah and he kneels down in the

01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:10,890
fresh soil near these these young plants

01:19:08,189 --> 01:19:14,079
around the back and he draws something

01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:18,890
that looks like a crown

01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:20,989
inverted there's a thick base the base

01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:24,850
of the crown is obviously the top of it

01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:26,630
in this and it comes down into five

01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:30,050
jagged points

01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:32,840
it's either teeth or something like that

01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:35,690
but the the five points of it are very

01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:38,989
very clear and he's like it's going to

01:19:35,689 --> 01:19:41,839
look like this it can be hidden anywhere

01:19:38,989 --> 01:19:44,359
this image can be hidden anywhere and

01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:48,020
when we find it we're going to find

01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:51,339
Brahma oh he's right this is weird this

01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:54,140
is weird can I do a perception check see

01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:55,579
absolutely absolutely so there so

01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:58,070
because as you're looking around there's

01:19:55,579 --> 01:20:01,789
so many like when you start to hear him

01:19:58,069 --> 01:20:03,759
talk about it it's like you you start to

01:20:01,789 --> 01:20:07,159
really process things that are in your

01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:09,140
visual space like every step to the left

01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:11,599
or right you take is slightly altering

01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:13,490
these your your perception of these

01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,010
things you're coming around the side of

01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:19,069
the building now this is this building

01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:22,820
is being occluded by a building next to

01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:24,349
it that has a roof maybe that's it see

01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:27,679
the top of this roof and then it has a

01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:30,260
broken window like he is it's like

01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:35,810
apophenia like you don't know if he is

01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:39,800
correct or if he had or if he is miss

01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:41,840
perceiving something gravely well the

01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:45,409
the template of lysander is he's the

01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,150
morning lord which i mean i could be way

01:20:45,409 --> 01:20:48,470
off here but the there's it seems like

01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:51,229
there would be a lot of Sun imagery

01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:53,030
which would look if it was broken in

01:20:51,229 --> 01:20:55,459
half or occluded somehow it would be

01:20:53,029 --> 01:20:57,590
like the bottom of a Sun is what he's

01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:59,239
drawn didn't even have to do no that's

01:20:57,590 --> 01:21:01,940
clever for that yeah that's very clever

01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:02,090
Thanks rosie has no idea about any of

01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:04,939
that

01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:07,190
yeah well Rosie does a perception role

01:21:04,939 --> 01:21:09,409
to know she knows that and it's a that's

01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:11,389
like you know the fifteen does she know

01:21:09,409 --> 01:21:13,720
that stuff but you're basically you can

01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:16,820
see this the Sun iconography is

01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:19,490
absolutely plain but Lysander's son

01:21:16,819 --> 01:21:22,489
would have to many points along the

01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:25,189
bottom for it to map correctly even

01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:26,569
broken for it to map correctly you don't

01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:31,399
think that it would look

01:21:26,569 --> 01:21:33,590
the right way okay so explore explore

01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:36,799
the space yeah let me do a roll real

01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:37,970
quick of what I want I said I went to

01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,400
perception you say oh yeah absolutely

01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:42,890
absolutely I just want to feel good and

01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:48,619
I can I play the game I just wanna roll

01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:52,240
god damn it yeah I'm gonna do so there's

01:21:48,619 --> 01:21:54,979
there is sweat standing out on his brow

01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:56,869
he is getting more and more desperate as

01:21:54,979 --> 01:22:00,769
he circles this OH

01:21:56,869 --> 01:22:02,269
as he circles this building probably

01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:04,490
it's yeah it's just that if the

01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:07,570
after-effects I'm feeling good no no no

01:22:04,489 --> 01:22:09,949

01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:11,719
we haven't gotten after-effects yet I

01:22:09,949 --> 01:22:18,019
didn't I didn't I never send my story

01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:22,220
that he was done shitting I've been

01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:25,430
granted a kind of limited flight it's

01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:26,869
like Iceman but shit like shit like shit

01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:28,760
man shit me basically yeah

01:22:26,869 --> 01:22:30,769
long story short shit man classic

01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:34,489
classic Marvel character yes

01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:37,100
what was your I got a 23 to my

01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:42,649
perception role oh wow yeah so you are

01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:45,950
so now you are circling around the front

01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:51,429
trying to see more and then once you get

01:22:45,949 --> 01:22:55,359
around to the west side of the building

01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:57,710
you can see that there is a procession

01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:59,839
coming down the street like in your mind

01:22:57,710 --> 01:23:02,659
like you're trying to match up these

01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,670
images just this in space and you can

01:23:02,659 --> 01:23:09,710
see that there is a procession of people

01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:15,039
singing there are sensors of incense and

01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:18,079
they are clearly taking honored dead

01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:19,010
from somewhere like this is this

01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:21,920
procession this is the kind of

01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:25,220
procession that cost money like this is

01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:27,440
this is not a practical matter this is

01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:30,350
this is something this is the premium

01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:34,519
service that you can expect from the

01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:37,130
upper echelons and so you can see them

01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:39,240
sort of moving them like and you can see

01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:43,079
this this is a long procession

01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:44,069
and it's coming down the middle of the

01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:45,809
road the one that you would typically

01:23:44,069 --> 01:23:47,399
take to drive straight through and you

01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:50,220
can see that it actually snakes a little

01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:53,759
bit off to the left from the main

01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:59,820
courtyard could i I know just someone

01:23:53,760 --> 01:24:02,670
and ask yeah absolutely who this

01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:04,170
procession is for this is just something

01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:06,149
so you just not someone there just like

01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:09,359
watching it it's like the opposite of a

01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:11,069
parade in some respects right in most

01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:15,869
respects I think it's just be an anti

01:24:11,069 --> 01:24:19,079
parade and so you know somebody and you

01:24:15,869 --> 01:24:21,869
ask what the who's this honored dead I

01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:26,760
say people with more gold than you or me

01:24:21,869 --> 01:24:28,680
lady okay it's all right cool it's okay

01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:32,789
okay just a story they're not really

01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:36,869
dead yeah this symbol is it symmetrical

01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:39,390
oh no one we've seen not exactly okay

01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:42,210
okay no it isn't perfect do I get

01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:43,650
anything from it as having eyes of the

01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:45,960
room keeper does it have a meaning that

01:24:43,649 --> 01:24:47,819
I can discern or is adjusted its it

01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,350
appears to it appears to merely be an

01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:53,399
icon you haven't you haven't seen this

01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:55,200
exam this configuration okay okay we

01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:57,269
inferred some icon yeah yeah you know we

01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,590
go to a lookout and know that the

01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:00,600
buildings actually make the shavers

01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:02,550
right can I do any kind of business

01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:06,240
dungeons and motherfucking dragons all

01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:09,510
right you can do it what is it I find

01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:11,369
that I like find the thing I got it in

01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:15,329
fact I do cuz I want to use locate

01:25:11,369 --> 01:25:18,750
objects oh just give it go that's I mean

01:25:15,329 --> 01:25:20,100
strong I look at it if it's a thing if

01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:22,829
it's a good drawing I can like get an

01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:25,980
object from it right interesting I go

01:25:22,829 --> 01:25:27,890
right okay you can try I got you yeah

01:25:25,979 --> 01:25:30,389
yeah you're this is an awesome drawing

01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:32,430
so I'm gonna use locate object based on

01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:36,360
your drawing so I'm gonna absorb this

01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:37,590
this symbol into my brain and then it

01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:38,909
can sense the direction of the obviously

01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:40,260
Haitian along the object is within a

01:25:38,909 --> 01:25:44,849
thousand feet okay

01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:46,920
so you are taking this shape and you are

01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:49,590
thinking about it can you are meditating

01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:51,619
on this shape and extending your

01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:56,310
awareness to

01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:59,640
as you hold the shape in your mind and

01:25:56,310 --> 01:26:06,920
begin to concentrate on it and try to

01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:10,800
find it in this place you can see the

01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:16,140
tines of this of this sort of corrupt

01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:25,560
crown begin to arrive and hiss in your

01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:28,619
mind going on in there big guy yeah so

01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,970
use your words and I describe that I do

01:26:28,619 --> 01:26:35,609
what I say what he just said that Oak

01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:37,440
get you 6 okay so you're describing this

01:26:35,609 --> 01:26:41,489
crown is that the tines are writhing

01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:43,409
like yeah oh yeah so tentacular I try to

01:26:41,489 --> 01:26:45,960
I try to look for it I guess I can't

01:26:43,409 --> 01:26:47,789
find it and then the the thing I started

01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:50,039
thinking about starts changing itself in

01:26:47,789 --> 01:26:54,569
my brain okay more in your wheelhouse

01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:57,479
yeah hmm get in there get inside yeah

01:26:54,569 --> 01:26:59,039
okay I'll climb in hop in yeah well I

01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:02,129
don't know if I can see get it right

01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:04,109
along it yeah what do i yeah it doesn't

01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:07,470
work exactly like that yeah like I say

01:27:04,109 --> 01:27:14,219
so VR Can I grab a perception check from

01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:16,159
you Rosita a tent no no no so you can

01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:19,289
see that from that from that distant

01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:22,260
path you can see the end of the

01:27:19,289 --> 01:27:24,659
procession okay in any kind of like

01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:26,640
processional flags or family crests yeah

01:27:24,659 --> 01:27:31,349
yeah it's it's it's all it's all

01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:34,920
petitioners and clergy of lysander all

01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:36,539
the iconography okay is based on that

01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:38,489
it's all a sander could I ask someone

01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:40,619
who's a member of the proceeding like

01:27:38,489 --> 01:27:42,269
yeah walking folks I want to come in at

01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:45,750
the tail end might be rude but you can

01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:48,810
try I've never stopped me before

01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:51,359
yeah so I I will come in and I will try

01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:53,280
to look as like grave and honorific as

01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:55,769
possible well here here at the end you

01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:58,739
can find a few people that have clearly

01:27:55,770 --> 01:28:03,260
just sort of bolted themselves on like

01:27:58,739 --> 01:28:03,260
me it's imagine if you will a dark limbo

01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:15,850
how spooky as hell so so these these

01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:17,939
people they're not they are not killing

01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:22,570
that of the priesthood yeah but they are

01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:24,519
they are dressed to the nines like it's

01:28:22,569 --> 01:28:27,159
almost like they are holding the last

01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:30,280
rites again here this sort of like

01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:34,750
wealthy caboose okay attached to the

01:28:30,279 --> 01:28:38,069
rest of this funeral serpent okay I'm

01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:43,300
gonna try the one who looks the most

01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:46,329
gullible like you you use your grandma

01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:49,270
techniques yeah yeah and I'll all sidle

01:28:46,329 --> 01:28:53,949
in next to that person and all I'll say

01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:57,250

I hate I hated him and oh I meet you I

01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:14,350
deeply resent oh not only this

01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:16,239
interaction but also the fact that I

01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:19,810
have to make a great show of this

01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:22,750
remorse such it is such a relief to find

01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:25,270
someone else who also hated him Oh God

01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:41,079
how so because we had to front it we had

01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:44,850
to front the money to get him moved out

01:29:41,079 --> 01:29:48,550

it wasn't 10 gold pieces I'll tell you

01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,630
that much

01:30:02,289 --> 01:30:06,189
hey you know what though I have to say I

01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:08,500
know you had to front it but this is a

01:30:06,189 --> 01:30:13,960
nice ceremony you didn't it's very

01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:17,289
tasteful you did a good job yeah yeah

01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:19,180
I know I get it I get it but when you

01:30:17,289 --> 01:30:24,279
got to do it you do it up it's like

01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:28,150
listen there is an inn near the church

01:30:24,279 --> 01:30:31,840
yeah I'm really looking forward to that

01:30:28,149 --> 01:30:33,059
part yeah that's where this ends and

01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,739
that's where I'm going

01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:36,520
that's where you're going we're gonna go

01:30:35,739 --> 01:30:39,849
together

01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:40,960
let's talk babe we're gonna have some

01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:46,020
words all right

01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:46,020
see you there what name by the way

01:30:46,699 --> 01:30:55,398
[Laughter]

01:30:49,789 --> 01:30:55,399
[Applause]

01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:00,130
master work I was gonna say that I see

01:30:58,539 --> 01:31:02,140
you go to the back of the line and I'm

01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:05,230
like that's a very smart idea so but I

01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:08,980
approach the center of the procession

01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:10,629
where where the where the pallbearers it

01:31:08,979 --> 01:31:15,579
would be in the pallbearers and I start

01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:18,340
kind of like you know walking like then

01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:23,500
give give one a nudge and I go he got in

01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:25,880
there as if I was comparing like school

01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:27,889
lunches with someone

01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:30,139
yeah yeah what you got in there you you

01:31:27,889 --> 01:31:32,750
give him a nudge and you think that he

01:31:30,139 --> 01:31:34,550
here very near the end of this

01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:40,849
procession do you think that his

01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:45,199
strength is at a low ebb and he stumbles

01:31:40,849 --> 01:31:50,449
for a second whip and the casket slides

01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:54,589
straight off onto the cobble and you see

01:31:50,448 --> 01:31:58,428
an arm bit decked in jewels and

01:31:54,590 --> 01:32:00,590
bracelets come out the side and he

01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:05,029
kneels and start spraying very quickly

01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:08,300
as he tries to stuff this corpse back in

01:32:05,029 --> 01:32:09,559
am I able to get a get a quick peek how

01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:12,650
fast does this happen

01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:17,179
can I help it's happening in seconds can

01:32:12,649 --> 01:32:20,448
I help by sticking the I end of legate

01:32:17,179 --> 01:32:21,920
in there to help right the casket but

01:32:20,448 --> 01:32:25,638
actually I just wanna get like a dentist

01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:31,429
mirror just want to take a look and I go

01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:35,779
oh no whoever it is in there just

01:32:31,429 --> 01:32:38,810
wearing a golden death mask so this is

01:32:35,779 --> 01:32:40,460
this is yeah it's like if it's like some

01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:42,770
people to expend a lot of money like on

01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:44,359
vacations or like their home apparently

01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:47,389
you can spend a lot of money just dying

01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:50,868
yeah okay

01:32:55,310 --> 01:33:01,429
Cuddy and he goes I'm Sebastian's

01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:21,960
of this church

01:33:19,229 --> 01:33:24,929

01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,328
[Applause]

01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:04,970
and I see I see what he's up to and then

01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:09,420
I gives me an idea I get back in the car

01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:10,890
so unbeknownst to you during this

01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:15,690
conversation that you have had with

01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:18,000
fantasy Steve as he is sort of branching

01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:21,059
off and he's gonna make his way toward

01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:26,180
this in right which might just be his

01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:31,250
house I mean who knows Oak is with you

01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:34,350
and he says there's two fucking churches

01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:36,989
yeah it sounds like they're moving this

01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:38,880
dead fella from the old one to the new

01:34:36,989 --> 01:34:40,289
one and to be honest with you he sounds

01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:45,300
like kind of a son of a bitch what am i

01:34:40,289 --> 01:34:47,880
confiding in you get out there dammit

01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:48,829
oh you think maybe the other church

01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:53,369
dammit

01:34:48,829 --> 01:34:54,750
and he's like we're not done we knew we

01:34:53,369 --> 01:34:55,920
need to go we need to find out where

01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,750
that we need to find out where the end

01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:01,829
of this is we need to find out where the

01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:03,149
other church is okay I mean it's a big

01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:04,970
city is probably more than two churches

01:35:03,149 --> 01:35:07,199
you think this one through

01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:08,430
all right just going from one of the

01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:10,949
other didn't just follow them I think

01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:14,159
they're coming from the other one so we

01:35:10,949 --> 01:35:18,659
can follow the trail yeah exactly so you

01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:22,289
can so you ease corriander so as you get

01:35:18,659 --> 01:35:23,059
up into the cart corriander doesn't move

01:35:22,289 --> 01:35:30,979
an inch

01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:34,720
uh-oh what's up girl she goes again

01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:42,589

is it my money to you who knows until 10

01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:26,210
coins are consumed what he's into

01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:28,610
motherfucker this is oh listen it's not

01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:33,079
eaten any platinum this is classic MMO

01:36:28,609 --> 01:36:35,689
game design this is a gold sync we use

01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:38,689
our real life money and give it to Jerry

01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:42,319
but I love this plan we could buy loot

01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:48,289
boxes yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right

01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:49,369
Wow wait listen

01:36:48,289 --> 01:36:51,199
obviously they say there's gonna be a

01:36:49,369 --> 01:36:56,750
tokenized currency and we'll discuss it

01:36:51,199 --> 01:37:00,250
so 10 coins later the dry tongue licks

01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:03,170
those brass lips and she's ready to roll

01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:06,199
and so you're pulling out alongside the

01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:10,039
road you pass through the center

01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:11,750
courtyard and then off to the left where

01:37:10,039 --> 01:37:17,930
that procession is so sort of trailing

01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:21,979
out you see a vision of a Lysander

01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:23,650
Church that is in disrepair so this is

01:37:21,979 --> 01:37:27,439
what it looks like

01:37:23,649 --> 01:37:32,359
after they move the operation somewhere

01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:35,329
else the old chapel looks like this

01:37:32,359 --> 01:37:38,719
so this Lysander temple you don't know

01:37:35,329 --> 01:37:40,939
if there was a fire of some kind or if

01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:45,310
the fire occurred after they left it but

01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:45,309
it is in profound disrepair

01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:50,819
do we see if they've unearthed anybody

01:37:48,149 --> 01:37:53,039
else or was this like the only one fit

01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:55,889
to be moved oh no this doesn't that

01:37:53,038 --> 01:37:59,398
procession had many but you were all you

01:37:55,889 --> 01:38:03,179
only managed to destroy one taxi but you

01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:04,229
could have destroyed as many as 30 it's

01:38:03,179 --> 01:38:06,118
like that scene in Raiders of the Lost

01:38:04,229 --> 01:38:12,360
Ark where Indy's knocking baskets over.

01:38:06,118 --> 01:38:14,429
yeah yeah whoo and then so even before

01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:19,348
the cart has stopped in front of this

01:38:14,429 --> 01:38:22,918
place Oak is out and he wipes his brow

01:38:19,349 --> 01:38:25,529
with his thumb and he says he's going in

01:38:22,918 --> 01:38:37,679
and he's like don't touch anything in

01:38:25,529 --> 01:38:42,809
here just look just try to find it he's

01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:44,519
doing slack I love it so as you enter an

01:38:42,809 --> 01:38:49,019
era fine for this yeah yeah exactly

01:38:44,519 --> 01:38:51,208
it is shredded just shredded pews it's

01:38:49,019 --> 01:38:55,139
like there's a there's a bunch of

01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:58,260
rodents more or less where parishioners

01:38:55,139 --> 01:39:01,128
might be you don't know if now it's a

01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:04,498
mouse church you know it's hard to know

01:39:01,128 --> 01:39:08,878
but just imagery in here there's a lot

01:39:04,498 --> 01:39:11,728
of blackened stone and a lot of a lot of

01:39:08,878 --> 01:39:14,359
ruin okay like it is it is it has fallen

01:39:11,729 --> 01:39:17,639
into disrepair incredibly quickly

01:39:14,359 --> 01:39:22,768
friends would it be wise for me to get a

01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:25,469
view from higher up sure oh yeah that's

01:39:22,769 --> 01:39:29,760
in credit I love that but then I uh I

01:39:25,469 --> 01:39:33,599
will cast fly now describe it in detail

01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:36,149
yeah please season two I make a request

01:39:33,599 --> 01:39:39,809
to this this God that even I do not know

01:39:36,149 --> 01:39:43,949
the name of this force that you can see

01:39:39,809 --> 01:39:47,010
extend a black slender tentacle down

01:39:43,948 --> 01:39:50,728
from so far up in the sky and it finds

01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:52,739
me and circles me and I immediately lose

01:39:50,729 --> 01:39:57,530
a lot of control of my body go very limp

01:39:52,738 --> 01:39:57,529
so and I can die take to the heavens

01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:02,910
down like bait no exactly oh yeah yeah

01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:05,789
definitely

01:40:02,909 --> 01:40:08,550
because it's not smooth so it comes down

01:40:05,789 --> 01:40:12,420
through a hole in what was once this

01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:14,460
blessed dome and then as it does so it

01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:19,500
comes down and it Yanks you up it Yanks

01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:21,779
up your limp - all like form and you hit

01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:25,800
your head on part of the stone coming

01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:29,309
out and then just sort of start to swing

01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:30,989
around inside like a wrecking ball like

01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:41,970
coming into contact with bent

01:40:30,989 --> 01:40:45,210
chandeliers you take for damage as you

01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:49,260
as you crash directly through the single

01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:52,039
remaining stained glass facing the east

01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:56,530
of Lysander's dome through I'm through

01:40:52,039 --> 01:40:56,529
[Laughter]

01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:04,019
right here so yeah dish up the

01:41:01,229 --> 01:41:07,739
perception and because you are so high I

01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:08,960
will give you advantage yeah alright

01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:13,039
here we go

01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:15,149
before not bad not bad almost over

01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:20,970
that's gonna be nice so that's gonna be

01:41:15,149 --> 01:41:23,939
a nineteen that's very good so as you're

01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:26,510
sort of swinging back and forth there is

01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:30,119
a but you know sort of a pendulum motion

01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:35,579
there is a point in the center of this

01:41:30,119 --> 01:41:38,960
pendulum motion where the altar that a

01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:43,680
chunk of the ceiling has sundered

01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:45,390
becomes the shape he suggested but it's

01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:48,300
only when it's viewed from a very

01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:50,850
specific perspective and as soon as you

01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:54,029
see it it's as though the symbol holds

01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:57,000
itself there for a second longer than it

01:41:54,029 --> 01:42:00,319
should right so it sort of is a concept

01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:07,470
that is fixed in space it consistent yes

01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:09,539
guys get up here so he so Oak tree

01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:11,220
strike is looking up at you as you're

01:42:09,539 --> 01:42:12,628
swinging down and then he's like looking

01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:14,070
where you're looking yeah

01:42:12,628 --> 01:42:18,988
and then he stands out in the middle of

01:42:14,069 --> 01:42:24,118
the room and he says yes yes and yes he

01:42:18,988 --> 01:42:25,888
is loving it dress some and so you can

01:42:24,118 --> 01:42:32,639
see it too once you draws your attention

01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:38,399
to it this sundered altar has this very

01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:41,819
clear teeth we can wait hello you can

01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:44,550
see these jagged tooth light shapes and

01:42:41,819 --> 01:42:47,308
again they're not uniform they are they

01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:49,439
are slightly longer or shorter or

01:42:47,309 --> 01:42:57,510
thinner than they would be if they had

01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:59,070
been an intentional sigil okay you want

01:42:57,510 --> 01:43:01,800
to do some perceptional nose yeah sure

01:42:59,069 --> 01:43:06,058
you got the good perception yes oh look

01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:08,458
at it give it a discerning eye 17 yeah

01:43:06,059 --> 01:43:13,229
yeah it's it's cobbled together from

01:43:08,458 --> 01:43:15,868
seemingly random shapes but you can see

01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:18,899
it you can see it too and as soon as you

01:43:15,868 --> 01:43:22,078
see it it's like that is it stands out

01:43:18,899 --> 01:43:23,789
from its surroundings puzzle yeah it's

01:43:22,078 --> 01:43:27,658
that is exactly like a magic eye puzzle

01:43:23,788 --> 01:43:32,128
it seems like you you immediately parse

01:43:27,658 --> 01:43:34,948
it as important so it's above us right

01:43:32,128 --> 01:43:37,319
but just this is we're down here is the

01:43:34,948 --> 01:43:40,168
whole place is a wreck I sit right up on

01:43:37,319 --> 01:43:43,099
this altered sort of Dyess okay once

01:43:40,168 --> 01:43:48,118
you've seen it now you know where it is

01:43:43,099 --> 01:43:51,119
you see it yeah yeah

01:43:48,118 --> 01:43:53,549
so I everyone seems to be having this

01:43:51,118 --> 01:43:58,498
revelation and I'm looking around and I

01:43:53,550 --> 01:44:00,570
don't I don't see a Brahma Oak seems

01:43:58,498 --> 01:44:03,300
like you said that we see the shape and

01:44:00,569 --> 01:44:05,908
then we find Brahma but don't really see

01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:11,699
her no she's got to be here

01:44:05,908 --> 01:44:15,628
well she that's my information he walks

01:44:11,698 --> 01:44:20,128
over and he's like dinar yo bro

01:44:15,628 --> 01:44:25,679
let's move this shit all right yes

01:44:20,128 --> 01:44:31,158
so yes sir yeah

01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:31,158
bro Arif oh yeah exactly don't you dare

01:44:32,359 --> 01:44:37,529
[Music]

01:44:34,849 --> 01:44:45,349
and then I move everything with a big

01:44:37,529 --> 01:44:49,349
smile on my face beneath beneath these

01:44:45,349 --> 01:44:53,219
this wrecked and ruined stone you can

01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:57,269
find an entrance down through the Dyess

01:44:53,219 --> 01:45:02,849
into darkness that's way more our speed

01:44:57,269 --> 01:45:05,130
yeah okay going down yeah let's go I'm

01:45:02,849 --> 01:45:07,380
like immediately like okay let's go

01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:11,189
um can I hop on your shoulders in ride

01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:14,458
yes yes deal Rosie's on my back and

01:45:11,189 --> 01:45:16,590
we're both muttering about Oak Truestrike

01:45:14,458 --> 01:45:18,630
can't believe it so he is so he

01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:22,319
has gone down immediately as soon as

01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:26,609
there is a path downward he is ready to

01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:29,969
commit sure and so he moves down and you

01:45:26,609 --> 01:45:36,268
can tell immediately that once you go

01:45:29,969 --> 01:45:40,380
down this catacomb has recesses for

01:45:36,269 --> 01:45:44,789
names and then plates for names that

01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:48,809
have been ground away by time like this

01:45:44,788 --> 01:45:51,899
is this is an ancient sort of almost

01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:56,070
like a cistern depth it's just massive

01:45:51,899 --> 01:46:00,958
and as you go down it sort of seems to

01:45:56,069 --> 01:46:04,498
go out in a ring you can see that the

01:46:00,958 --> 01:46:05,880
two paths sort of curve past and you can

01:46:04,498 --> 01:46:08,069
and you can tell this is the other thing

01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:10,409
that is immediately apparent is that

01:46:08,069 --> 01:46:12,808
none of the people on this floor could

01:46:10,408 --> 01:46:17,038
apparently afford to get placed in the

01:46:12,809 --> 01:46:20,189
new catacomb I see there's a whole lot

01:46:17,038 --> 01:46:28,978
of people here and a whole lot of no

01:46:20,189 --> 01:46:30,719
gold or masks okay I mean I assumed I

01:46:28,979 --> 01:46:33,539
assumed Carthoris could find plenty of

01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:35,670
things to enjoy the true treasure like

01:46:33,538 --> 01:46:37,828
it's it's like hell surrounded by bodies

01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:41,099
but nothing to loot

01:46:37,828 --> 01:46:43,109
that's dungeon hell so we'll be right on

01:46:41,099 --> 01:46:46,199
Oak like almost like I'm trying to like

01:46:43,109 --> 01:46:51,769
I'm trying to pass him yeah I'm ready

01:46:46,198 --> 01:46:56,399
first yes absolutely so you come around

01:46:51,770 --> 01:47:00,030
the side and you can see that there are

01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:04,799
certain points on the right side of this

01:47:00,029 --> 01:47:09,029
path that are open and look into a

01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:13,369
central volume of space a central sort

01:47:09,029 --> 01:47:17,969
of cylindrical volume and as you peek in

01:47:13,368 --> 01:47:21,000
you can see that there are tiny lights

01:47:17,969 --> 01:47:23,189
shifting around in the deep deep bass

01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,539
what looks to be a couple floors down

01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:26,819
and you can look across and see the

01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:32,609
layers of this thing imagine if you were

01:47:26,819 --> 01:47:36,779
a dark cake I'm fine with it and I'm

01:47:32,609 --> 01:47:40,289
gonna leverage it yeah so but you can

01:47:36,779 --> 01:47:43,019
sort of see it go down sort of layer by

01:47:40,289 --> 01:47:46,078
layer and then down at the base of this

01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:49,369
you can see what looked to be like a

01:47:46,078 --> 01:47:51,929
pair of like what is left of a statue

01:47:49,368 --> 01:47:54,598
that must have at one point reached the

01:47:51,929 --> 01:47:57,980
entire height and now there's just this

01:47:54,599 --> 01:48:01,380
just a pair of like shattered legs and

01:47:57,979 --> 01:48:05,279
then a sort of stone and rubble around

01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:09,529
the base time was not kind to this no it

01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:09,529
was the enemy yeah Wow

01:48:11,328 --> 01:48:16,880
I think the funniest curse about this

01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:18,439
armor of yours and it's really hard for

01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:37,159
you to self high-five over that chest

01:48:18,439 --> 01:48:40,189
piece as you come around to the end of

01:48:37,158 --> 01:48:45,049
this ring yes you can see that it splits

01:48:40,189 --> 01:48:51,169
into two stairs deeper that then go down

01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:54,020
to the second rung of this thing do we

01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:55,670
want to pick one do we want to split the

01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:58,070
party you know I love that so look on

01:48:55,670 --> 01:49:00,590
Oaks face when we we come upon that does

01:48:58,069 --> 01:49:02,090
he seem too rich which part when we see

01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:04,340
that there are now two sets of stairs

01:49:02,090 --> 01:49:06,170
going down this heap well once you reach

01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:07,789
the end yeah there's sort of a landing

01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:12,020
and then those both sets of those stairs

01:49:07,789 --> 01:49:13,819
just go down to the next it's not a it's

01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:17,900
not a classic choice it's just an

01:49:13,819 --> 01:49:23,058
architectural note meaning a picture

01:49:17,899 --> 01:49:26,089
with your words yeah I admire it it's

01:49:23,059 --> 01:49:28,730
gonna say sweet perception for sure

01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:33,860
yes dungeon dragons baby alright I well

01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:36,289
I'm the one not to do it eight no no no

01:49:33,859 --> 01:49:38,839
it's it's dinar it's like it's fine

01:49:36,289 --> 01:49:44,809
yeah yeah it's dark down here so I'm

01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:52,369
pretty useless I don't know if I've ever

01:49:44,809 --> 01:49:55,210
seen stairs before I'm so no it's it's

01:49:52,368 --> 01:49:57,289
uh it's like a saw you would walk on

01:49:55,210 --> 01:49:58,819
rather than do perception I'm gonna do

01:49:57,289 --> 01:50:00,590
an hour can I check because I just want

01:49:58,819 --> 01:50:01,670
to perceive if there's any like latent

01:50:00,590 --> 01:50:05,659
mm-hm

01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:08,899
anything I get us get a taste of there

01:50:05,658 --> 01:50:10,219
she is there she is so close yeah it's

01:50:08,899 --> 01:50:12,888
not great it's probably seven it's a

01:50:10,219 --> 01:50:15,889
seven handsome fine three no no no I

01:50:12,889 --> 01:50:19,609
mean this is clean this is it's very

01:50:15,889 --> 01:50:21,710
safe and fresh you know I have the Glade

01:50:19,609 --> 01:50:23,509
plugin

01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:26,689
as we're getting down deeper into a

01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:29,869
scary hole full of dead bodies I will

01:50:26,689 --> 01:50:31,339
divine sense just to try to get a get a

01:50:29,869 --> 01:50:32,869
little little note on this there's

01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:33,980
anything fucking down what are you

01:50:32,869 --> 01:50:37,670
trying to what are you trying to pull

01:50:33,979 --> 01:50:39,799
trying to detect presence of strong evil

01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:41,960
registers of my senses so if there are

01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:45,770
celestial fee nan dead so have you ever

01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:48,409
seen those novelty have you ever seen

01:50:45,770 --> 01:50:53,030
those novelty cocktails that have them

01:50:48,409 --> 01:50:54,800
multiple layers in it Yeah right like

01:50:53,029 --> 01:50:57,469
different viscosities float on top of

01:50:54,800 --> 01:51:01,369
each other exactly that's that's your

01:50:57,469 --> 01:51:06,649
sense of this tomb you can tell that the

01:51:01,369 --> 01:51:11,449
layer you're on exists in one divine

01:51:06,649 --> 01:51:15,469
space and is defined by a divine power

01:51:11,449 --> 01:51:16,939
that is not evil and then the lower it

01:51:15,469 --> 01:51:18,649
gets down and you and you've seen this

01:51:16,939 --> 01:51:22,699
through that sort of portal that looks

01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:28,238
in you can tell that each layer is more

01:51:22,699 --> 01:51:33,260
and more compromised by a profound

01:51:28,238 --> 01:51:37,399
chaotic force just a slippery skulking

01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:39,500
evil okay so standing next to the dead

01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:45,549
body is in this dark hallway I'm like

01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:47,869
it's evil down there guys a hot tip

01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:49,610
Rosie completely misunderstands she's

01:51:47,869 --> 01:51:55,309
like no it's not it's actually perfectly

01:51:49,609 --> 01:51:59,869
healthy and normal, it happens to every

01:51:55,310 --> 01:52:04,910
young dragon. all this down here yeah

01:51:59,869 --> 01:52:07,460
that is what I meant. also fiends that's

01:52:04,909 --> 01:52:12,380
a separate conversation and it was the

01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:14,600
one I was starting I'm just so confused.

01:52:12,380 --> 01:52:16,279
yeah yeah it's just like it's almost

01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:20,450
that's like anxious okay

01:52:16,279 --> 01:52:22,939
viscous evil just like collapsing and

01:52:20,449 --> 01:52:26,679
increasing and density. So let's run get

01:52:22,939 --> 01:52:26,679
our weapons out yeah

01:52:30,029 --> 01:52:39,489
Do you have a cool sound you'd like to

01:52:32,109 --> 01:52:41,829
make Chris because he still chirps even

01:52:39,489 --> 01:52:45,340
up on the end yeah of the staff

01:52:41,829 --> 01:52:47,079
everyone's he still has a lot to say if

01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:49,420
it's evil down there and Brahma's down

01:52:47,079 --> 01:52:50,949
there and when I get that okay well I

01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:53,560
want to get down there as soon as as

01:52:50,949 --> 01:52:55,569
possible. okay so let's get going I'm

01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:56,200
gonna do dark kruseman on myself. That's

01:52:55,569 --> 01:53:02,259
a great idea.

01:52:56,199 --> 01:53:07,739
need it real bad so all the as you get

01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:14,940
down to this next level the torches are

01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:18,939
alight but the color of the flame shifts

01:53:14,939 --> 01:53:22,359
it's almost like the the surface like an

01:53:18,939 --> 01:53:27,519
oil slick. The color is constantly

01:53:22,359 --> 01:53:31,960
shifting between a host of colors it

01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:36,910
can't seem to decide it's party lights

01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:38,710
oh nice yeah yeah exactly

01:53:36,909 --> 01:53:50,500
Can I get a perception check from you,

01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:54,189
Rosie? you over at the ethics it's a six

01:53:50,500 --> 01:54:01,329
that is terrible 
\dm Can I get a perception

01:53:54,189 --> 01:54:03,279

seems to it seems to it can hold its own

01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:36,069
against these strange torches but you

01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:39,010

in trouble let's go 

\dm He gets his daggers

01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:52,840
out ooh and breaks into a run down the

01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:55,750
hall around going back, basically around

01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:57,970
in the catacomb to the other side the

01:58:55,750 --> 01:59:00,369
way that we went you know now that we're

01:58:57,970 --> 01:59:01,090
down the floor you're coming back around

01:59:00,369 --> 01:59:03,069
the other way

01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:04,659
guys oh you may or may not have to

01:59:03,069 --> 01:59:08,529
capture him but he's really fast he's

01:59:04,659 --> 01:59:12,130
really cool was you hear you hear what

01:59:08,529 --> 01:59:14,460
rumbling sounds as soon as he runs back

01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:19,109
as soon as he runs down that path you

01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:22,210
hear rumbling sounds like heavy stones,

01:59:19,109 --> 01:59:24,939
falling and collapsing and then it

01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:28,270
sounds like it sounds like just like

01:59:24,939 --> 01:59:32,829
stone on stone like not grinding, but

01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:34,420
smooth motion. You can sort of feel it

01:59:32,829 --> 01:59:36,189
you can sort of feel it in your feet

01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:38,289
this seems like a pretty good place to

01:59:36,189 --> 01:59:40,299
trap him if we need to but let's let's

01:59:38,289 --> 01:59:42,489
go let's go let's run okay I was gonna

01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:45,730
say, what's the what's the span between

01:59:42,489 --> 01:59:47,349
these two stairs? Like how does it work

01:59:45,729 --> 01:59:49,829
wouldn't be able to jump over will be

01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:53,520
able no no so basically each one each

01:59:49,829 --> 01:59:56,800
item is each tier of the cake is

01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:59,740
distinct with a set of double stairs on

01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:01,840
the opposite side that go down and then

01:59:59,739 --> 02:00:03,340
if it looks like the other one okay

02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:07,659
there will be another path down to this

02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:11,230
third floor I can't cut him off we have

02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:14,199
to chase him yeah yeah okay so you hear

02:00:11,229 --> 02:00:18,219
his footfalls and you can hear these you

02:00:14,199 --> 02:00:21,449
can hear this Stone rumbling on the way

02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:21,449
back okay

02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:29,770
I feel like maybe I want to catch up to

02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:32,289
him right yes yeah okay and I want to

02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:33,820
get him so I'm gonna go ahead and take

02:00:32,289 --> 02:00:35,359
this time to you're still on my

02:00:33,819 --> 02:00:38,750
shoulders

02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:43,279
you wild shape into a wolf oh we got

02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:45,770
some Midna type shit and I can

02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:49,000
immediately I feel like maybe I could do

02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:52,760
I could smell him there are so many

02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:56,060
powerful smells down here that's true is

02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:58,070
Walnut still corrupted she has been able

02:00:56,060 --> 02:01:00,200
to cast spells for the last month or so

02:00:58,069 --> 02:01:01,399
right but there the spells have been all

02:01:00,199 --> 02:01:04,809
weird

02:01:01,399 --> 02:01:08,769
no you she got a hold on it okay

02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:11,830
whatever that was appears to have passed

02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:16,640
she's on a new regimen I can get

02:01:11,829 --> 02:01:18,199
advantage on perception you can't if I

02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:21,710
want to sniff him out so I'm gonna try

02:01:18,199 --> 02:01:26,449
and sniff him out that was a for Chris

02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:28,550
get over my dice Oh fifteen plus seven

02:01:26,449 --> 02:01:31,819
so 22 yeah absolutely

02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:34,340
okay so yeah just it's it's perfect so

02:01:31,819 --> 02:01:37,670
it's like there's sort of imagine that

02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:40,039
there's a kind of olfactory symphony yes

02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:43,880
going on, and you just you identify the

02:01:40,039 --> 02:01:47,239
piccolo inside this massive stack of

02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:51,529
sensory input, and your feet are just

02:01:47,239 --> 02:01:54,139
padding along this smooth stone and as

02:01:51,529 --> 02:01:58,399
you do so, you can sort of feel that

02:01:54,140 --> 02:02:01,760
there are almost like ruts worn into the

02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:04,909
stone floor, almost like get a couple

02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:07,159
different rings, almost like a track oh I

02:02:04,909 --> 02:02:09,619
just have this I'm just telling you

02:02:07,159 --> 02:02:11,090
what's there I mean you know uh maybe

02:02:09,619 --> 02:02:14,930
it's fine I'm gonna do Pass Without a

02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:17,569
Trace on us to give us all +10 bonus to

02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:20,560
self to give you an umbral froude yes

02:02:17,569 --> 02:02:22,460
you bet is it so it would be you and

02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:24,590
experiencing it because I don't think

02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:26,930
we're we can't can't run as fast yeah

02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:28,060
sure it's it within 30 feet so keep up

02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:31,880
slowpoke

02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:35,210
what's your run speed as a as a mega

02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:38,150
wolf's fast 50 feet 
\kthriss Oh, let me ask you a

02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:41,210
question, can I I haven't ever tried to

02:02:38,149 --> 02:02:44,839
use my tentacle-fly beneath the ground.

02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:47,390
Is there a way that that tentacle would

02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:48,900
have enough tensile strength, or perhaps

02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:52,739
it could pierce through

02:02:48,899 --> 02:02:55,649
to permit me to move at that speed, which

02:02:52,738 --> 02:02:57,000
i think is 60 I can't read through this

02:02:55,649 --> 02:02:59,399
thing should I count yeah would you

02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,649
applying speed of 60 feet right the

02:02:59,399 --> 02:03:03,329
duration and it's ten minutes

02:03:01,649 --> 02:03:05,279
is it ten minutes maybe I don't have

02:03:03,329 --> 02:03:07,649
access no I think yeah I think you're

02:03:05,279 --> 02:03:10,948
okay but here's let me try to sell you

02:03:07,649 --> 02:03:17,309
on this concept okay okay what can I do

02:03:10,948 --> 02:03:19,939
to get you into a flight spell today? So

02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:22,170
there is this central

02:03:19,939 --> 02:03:24,210
cylindrical volume, as I've described

02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:28,069
before where once a statue,

02:03:24,210 --> 02:03:32,760
perhaps of Lysander, did stand proudly

02:03:28,069 --> 02:03:35,099
now up above you had flown ya down and

02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:38,329
so imagine that-- it's imagine that you

02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:42,179
have sort of like stumbled sort of

02:03:38,329 --> 02:03:43,738
dumbly and weakly down with this thread

02:03:42,179 --> 02:03:45,329
and, the same way that a child might,

02:03:43,738 --> 02:03:47,759
tie a thread to remember where they had

02:03:45,329 --> 02:03:49,500
been. Right okay. Imagine that once you

02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:55,590
get to a certain point down like a

02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:59,479
couple it becomes taut, and slices in an

02:03:55,590 --> 02:04:03,510
almost monomolecular way through,

02:03:59,479 --> 02:04:05,579
shearing the middle of this cake. Right.

02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:08,820
like a cheese, like a cheese knife yeah

02:04:05,579 --> 02:04:10,439
Right inside the central core of this,

02:04:08,819 --> 02:04:13,889
you can see that there is a, almost like,

02:04:10,439 --> 02:04:16,500
a stroke of frozen black or purple

02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:19,050
lightning that shoots and bores straight

02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:21,689
down through the center of it down into

02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:24,270
the dais that held the statue and what

02:04:21,689 --> 02:04:26,250
it is doing is -- you try to move is it is

02:04:24,270 --> 02:04:29,190
reaching a tendril through these

02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:32,640
regularly-spaced portals and it is

02:04:29,189 --> 02:04:34,349
reaching through and throwing you to be

02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:37,980
caught by the other, to be caught by

02:04:34,350 --> 02:04:41,850
another tentacle, and you have absolutely

02:04:37,979 --> 02:04:44,039
no control whatsoever. it is it is

02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:48,030
basically playing racquetball with you

02:04:44,039 --> 02:04:53,698
inside this maze 

\trystan And I Pass Without

02:04:48,029 --> 02:05:00,300
Trace.
\dm Yeah, so you are basically like a

02:04:53,698 --> 02:05:01,469
airborne ball of mist and shadow, that is

02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:05,640
being flung

02:05:01,469 --> 02:05:07,859
regularly from grip to grip each time.

02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:10,199
Like, there's a few moments of sensation

02:05:07,859 --> 02:05:11,639
right and then you're getting and you're

02:05:10,198 --> 02:05:13,529
like oh no, here comes again, and it just

02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:16,350
snatches you again. 

\kthriss Whenever I whenever I

02:05:13,529 --> 02:05:18,750
am returned to my senses, I know to

02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:20,640
tighten up into a ball I trust this

02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:22,948
thing, but when I am grabbed I start to

02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:24,810
go loose again but I just do it again

02:05:22,948 --> 02:05:26,579
only the two of you could come up with

02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:36,000
this just because Kris wants to move a

02:05:26,579 --> 02:05:37,680
little faster. yeah but mostly crawling

02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,710
or essentially talking about a Sonic the

02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:42,480
Hedgehog type scenario where you're

02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:44,219
moving from place to place love it

02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:50,689
you're riding on this and you're like

02:05:44,219 --> 02:05:52,279
hey what's going on hey wait ten minutes

02:05:50,689 --> 02:05:58,379
[Laughter]

02:05:52,279 --> 02:06:00,659
yeah exactly and then near the end of

02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:03,390
these stairs, you can see that Oak Truestrike

02:06:00,659 --> 02:06:11,819
is actually lying flat down on

02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:15,690
his face. oh yeah as you as you pull

02:06:11,819 --> 02:06:18,329
around and he as you get closer, he tries

02:06:15,689 --> 02:06:20,129
to get up on his on his hands and knees,

02:06:18,329 --> 02:06:23,939
and he looks back, and he's like 
\oak No, look

02:06:20,130 --> 02:06:26,760
out, keep to the side, keep it aside yeah

02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:29,039
and he-- exactly just gonna like scrabble

02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:32,039
is that sort of dog Scrabble on that

02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:36,689
like yeah just like pulling yourself up

02:06:32,039 --> 02:06:39,988
on this thing Kris, you have it fling

02:06:36,689 --> 02:06:42,689
you like right into one of these places

02:06:39,988 --> 02:06:45,329
where the bodies are are kept right

02:06:42,689 --> 02:06:47,219
You're welcome to just lie down and do

02:06:45,329 --> 02:06:55,289
what do what's necessary if you like.

02:06:47,219 --> 02:06:57,270
take your end now not yet to do so he

02:06:55,289 --> 02:07:02,909
rolls himself over and just as he does--

02:06:57,270 --> 02:07:04,590
so two boulders run along these tracks

02:07:02,909 --> 02:07:08,309
and it's almost like they're racing each

02:07:04,590 --> 02:07:12,710
other back and forth rolling around in

02:07:08,310 --> 02:07:15,480
this circle, sometimes changing lanes and

02:07:12,710 --> 02:07:18,840
scooting around and then once they pass

02:07:15,479 --> 02:07:23,039
the party, the rolling stops, and then

02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:26,279
they roll back even faster and then when

02:07:23,039 --> 02:07:31,340
they get over to you they sort of unfold

02:07:26,279 --> 02:07:41,880
backward and look at the party and say

02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:44,610
get here there go get here no yes I'm

02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:51,659
dead too I belong here that's why I'm in

02:07:44,609 --> 02:07:52,679
one of these things you're fine you can

02:07:51,659 --> 02:07:54,269
be here if you're dead if you're not

02:07:52,680 --> 02:08:00,239
dead that's the rules I'm sorry you

02:07:54,270 --> 02:08:03,960
gotta go I wanna ball make it I'll kill

02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:07,079
you put you one of the holes look it's

02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:09,689
just a job lady it's just a job what I I

02:08:07,079 --> 02:08:14,539
want to try an intimidation yeah okay

02:08:09,689 --> 02:08:14,539
yes all right

02:08:17,149 --> 02:08:26,159
13 bad let's see let's see how they

02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:32,670
resist it. okay they're like well you

02:08:26,159 --> 02:08:33,869
could stay for 10 minutes maybe and you

02:08:32,670 --> 02:08:36,029
gotta go you can't be here after that.

02:08:33,869 --> 02:08:38,010
you got to leave the second floor always

02:08:36,029 --> 02:08:41,029
we regard the second floor you hear

02:08:38,010 --> 02:08:45,030
another roll you hear another rock

02:08:41,029 --> 02:08:48,000
deeper, more profound, rolling up and it

02:08:45,029 --> 02:08:50,279
unfolds. It is slightly larger than the

02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,109
other two. my cherry well this is

02:08:50,279 --> 02:08:53,969
hundreds of dragons I tell you what's

02:08:52,109 --> 02:08:56,579
happening yeah listen I'm not saying

02:08:53,970 --> 02:09:00,390
it's bad heroes what he unrolls himself

02:08:56,579 --> 02:09:03,359
and he's slightly larger and clearly,

02:09:00,390 --> 02:09:06,300
just from the gem eyes, more intelligent

02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:08,969
than these and he says,

\rockguy I'm sorry about

02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:11,699
these boys thank you they're good boys

02:09:08,970 --> 02:09:14,430
they mean, they mean the best. I can tell

02:09:11,699 --> 02:09:18,300
but they're not the brightest. They only

02:09:14,430 --> 02:09:20,280
live for ten minutes or so, so they don't

02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:23,279
have a lot of time to pick up on some of

02:09:20,279 --> 02:09:24,719
the subtle nuances. I understand now that

02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:26,880
they took all the bodies out of the

02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:28,708
second floor. There's really nothing to

02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:31,920
protect. So yeah,

02:09:28,708 --> 02:09:33,538
hang out I guess. I mean, yeah, I'm just

02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:35,399
some kind of a floor to guy you know

02:09:33,538 --> 02:09:38,478
yeah I do know what you mean

02:09:35,399 --> 02:09:41,819
wait what's what's your name Caleb Durr

delay okay do we want to capture him now,

02:10:03,689 --> 02:10:09,889
or do we want to pretend we're still on

02:10:04,979 --> 02:10:13,110
his side? I don't think he thinks we're

02:10:09,889 --> 02:10:13,949
yeah woof woof woof woof All right, we'll

02:10:13,109 --> 02:10:16,259

02:11:11,189 --> 02:11:15,899
minutes or so and then they, you know,

02:11:13,319 --> 02:11:18,029

brief window, I'll try to make sure they

02:11:21,779 --> 02:11:25,590
know not to kill anybody. Each of one

02:11:23,550 --> 02:11:28,980
thing Parenthood I mean that's it's

02:11:25,590 --> 02:11:34,079
right off it's a tough road oh you

02:11:28,979 --> 02:11:41,419
should meet my children anyway are the

02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:45,869
dynamics so much like summer rocks

02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:48,510
really all right okay cool

02:11:45,869 --> 02:11:50,189
so we are gonna I'm gonna brush Oak off

02:11:48,510 --> 02:11:52,170
but my hands are actually slightly

02:11:50,189 --> 02:11:54,599
dirtier than he was so he's getting

02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:59,819
dirtier now I'll inject in the island I

02:11:54,600 --> 02:12:04,579

02:12:13,409 --> 02:12:22,059
[Laughter]

02:12:15,659 --> 02:12:25,300
painful he's he sort of straightens out

02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:27,280
the straps on his studded leather and

02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:29,079
starts it just takes one last look at

02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:29,649
this rock family and decides it's not

02:12:29,079 --> 02:12:34,000
for him.

02:12:29,649 --> 02:12:36,250
yeah you're welcome finds the join

02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:43,390
staircase at the other end of this ring

02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:43,689
and heads downstairs okay okay keep

02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:46,119
going

02:12:43,689 --> 02:12:48,399
mm-hmm We're-- we're all still +10 

02:12:46,119 --> 02:12:52,479
stuff oh yeah you're still fee for ooh

02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:56,079
no as you as you reach down to this

02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:59,639
floor, it is of a distinct construction

02:12:56,079 --> 02:13:04,300
from the other layers of this evil cake,

02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:07,030
insofar as you have reached the base of

02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:10,470
this cylinder and you are now looking at

02:13:07,029 --> 02:13:14,849
these massive feet from a position

02:13:10,470 --> 02:13:21,280
slightly below them, up into this dais, 

02:13:14,850 --> 02:13:24,990
and you can see that the ruined shavings

02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:29,349
and chunks of this statue have been

02:13:24,989 --> 02:13:31,779
cobbled in multiple places. Like, anywhere

02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:36,820
you walk through here, you can see that

02:13:31,779 --> 02:13:41,559
they've repurposed this stone into minor

02:13:36,819 --> 02:13:44,170
dwellings, profane altars, but everywhere

02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:47,680
you walk down here, there isn't a place

02:13:44,170 --> 02:13:50,619
where you do not feel the presence of

02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:52,240
this symbol upon your mind.

02:13:50,619 --> 02:13:54,609
Everywhere you look, as soon as you 

02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:57,609
move past one, you can see

02:13:54,609 --> 02:13:59,559
another variant of it. Here, you know you

02:13:57,609 --> 02:14:01,719
passed by another one you can look up

02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:03,940
and you can see that the very inside of

02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:08,350
the cylinder, you can see that the

02:14:03,939 --> 02:14:11,469
portals themselves and scraping chunks

02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:14,980
You can see vine columns that have tried

02:14:11,470 --> 02:14:19,119
to reach up inside here --you know, seeking

02:14:14,979 --> 02:14:21,519
light-- have made this shape inside. It's

02:14:19,119 --> 02:14:24,130
it's some kind of a it's some kind of a

02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:27,550
corruption that reaches beyond physical

02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:27,960
space.

\kthriss Do I recognize the construction of

02:14:27,550 --> 02:14:31,050
any of the

02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:33,689
in my time beneath the soil 
\dm No, no, this

02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:37,529
is this is not of drow construction. This

02:14:33,689 --> 02:14:39,719
is cobbled together from the literal

02:14:37,529 --> 02:14:41,969
remnants, like the shattered remnants of

02:14:39,719 --> 02:14:44,699
another temple, and the symbol that we

02:14:41,969 --> 02:14:50,100
can't help but see is this symbol that

02:14:44,699 --> 02:14:52,170
this inverse crown exactly and

02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:56,630
so now and he's just looking up in this

02:14:52,170 --> 02:15:00,270
cylinder and he's like,
\oak You see it, right?

02:14:56,630 --> 02:15:04,730
It's everywhere. yeah I see it what does

02:15:00,270 --> 02:15:08,910
it mean? He's just a shout Brahmas name

02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:14,279
okay okay and you can you can just hear

02:15:08,909 --> 02:15:17,969
it and then by the time that voice rises

02:15:14,279 --> 02:15:21,949
to the heights inside this cylinder, it

02:15:17,969 --> 02:15:25,409
sounds something like fractured laughs.

02:15:21,949 --> 02:15:27,719
Like the higher it bounces up, like the

02:15:25,409 --> 02:15:44,670
echo that comes back from this place is

02:15:27,719 --> 02:15:47,250
not true. Okay, perception roll 19 is very

02:15:44,670 --> 02:15:48,779
good, practically 20. Yeah it is. you

02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:51,300
haven't you have a perception bonus nope

02:15:48,779 --> 02:15:55,699
no I guess your your Donaar Blit'zen yeah

02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:58,199
in Iceland yeah you know in certain

02:15:55,699 --> 02:15:59,939
decrepit churches you know ninety cents

02:15:58,199 --> 02:16:02,309
counters place sure that's the thing

02:15:59,939 --> 02:16:06,389
\dm Look at some video. Look it up right now.

02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:10,969
Look it up, everyone! Google exactly 
\dm So

02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:16,590
peeking out from all from all these

02:16:10,969 --> 02:16:21,140
shattered, vile altars that they have

02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:25,680
constructed, you can see figures rising,

02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:27,510
each of which bears a mask that they

02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:30,739
wear across the forehead, that reaches

02:16:27,510 --> 02:16:32,909
down over the eyes, that has no

02:16:30,738 --> 02:16:35,069
perceivable -- there's no way to look

02:16:32,909 --> 02:16:40,649
through it from your perspective -- it

02:16:35,069 --> 02:16:41,879
looks entirely solid, and it's pretty

02:16:40,649 --> 02:16:45,090
clear that this is a

02:16:41,879 --> 02:16:48,478
kind of war and they've manufactured

02:16:45,090 --> 02:16:54,030
something like an anti temple in the

02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:55,829
face of this cistern hmm I say we're in

02:16:54,030 --> 02:17:02,010
luck everybody these guys must be

02:16:55,829 --> 02:17:04,110
completely blind yeah absolutely 
\dm I would

02:17:02,010 --> 02:17:07,219
love to see some initiative rolls, if I

02:17:04,110 --> 02:17:07,219
could. okay

02:17:13,129 --> 02:17:21,420
I'm old friend come on brand

02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:28,860
I got an 18 yeah

02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:30,808
six five oh wow oh yeah yeah well nuts

02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:34,229
murder in it again if three turns before

02:17:30,808 --> 02:17:41,759
we get to go okay

02:17:34,228 --> 02:17:46,648
this is how it goes each of them seems

02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:52,040
to be waiting, stock-still, for someone to

02:17:46,648 --> 02:17:56,519
move first and in the center

02:17:52,040 --> 02:18:07,830
emerging from between these two legs you

02:17:56,519 --> 02:18:11,700
see Brahma Lutier, with a red kerchief down

02:18:07,829 --> 02:18:14,610
low here and you can see just up the

02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:18,000
left side of her cheek you can see what

02:18:14,610 --> 02:18:22,040
looks like a tattoo would if it were in

02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:25,170
fact completely white Oh

02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:29,639
reaching up along her cheek and when she

02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:37,228
sees the party, she zeroes in on Walnut

02:18:29,638 --> 02:18:40,409
Dankgrass, and she says,
\Brahma Attack 
\dm and she

02:18:37,228 --> 02:18:43,619
pulls the kerchief up and disappears

02:18:40,409 --> 02:18:45,869
behind the statuary it is your turn,

02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:48,381
Walnut Dankgrass. how many are there

02:18:45,870 --> 02:18:52,760
there are five five great

02:18:48,380 --> 02:18:56,930
I'm gonna take the closest one how far

02:18:52,760 --> 02:19:00,229
away are they there are an assortment if

02:18:56,930 --> 02:19:01,309
you will from from basically any target

02:19:00,229 --> 02:19:03,139
that you want in front of you you can

02:19:01,309 --> 02:19:07,219
get to because you are still a dog I

02:19:03,139 --> 02:19:09,710
think I am still a _wolf_ sir, a _wolf_. Wolfnut,

02:19:07,219 --> 02:19:12,501
as they say. yes I'm gonna go ahead

02:19:09,710 --> 02:19:16,790
and try and do a bite on a close one

02:19:12,501 --> 02:19:18,081
yep Oh seven that's not a high number

02:19:16,790 --> 02:19:21,309
great

02:19:18,081 --> 02:19:26,421
it's a I said nibble. thank you

02:19:21,309 --> 02:19:27,889
then I um I don't pack I don't have pack

02:19:26,421 --> 02:19:32,421
tactics unless I'm within five feet of

02:19:27,889 --> 02:19:38,149
my people oh you read brand out well the

02:19:32,421 --> 02:19:41,751
closest one is he Oh first of all right

02:19:38,149 --> 02:19:47,659
I'm not writing out oh I see yeah Kris

02:19:41,751 --> 02:19:50,960
wrists route I am gonna be do we notice

02:19:47,659 --> 02:19:52,280
that they're waiting for motion yeah

02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:55,340
they're basically waiting for the

02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:58,610
command and now they ate it for the okay

02:19:55,341 --> 02:20:02,271
well then I will go ahead and cast fairy

02:19:58,610 --> 02:20:05,569
fire mm-hmm how many of them can I hit? I

02:20:02,271 --> 02:20:08,120
got a 20 foot 2015 box yeah three of

02:20:05,569 --> 02:20:13,640
them yeah okay so we can go ahead and

02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:15,501
and get advantage on tax on that hmm I

02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:18,681
think that's it it's all I got right now

02:20:15,501 --> 02:20:20,450
\dm Okay, let's take a look at you, Rosie Beestinger.

02:20:18,681 --> 02:20:26,030
How many will you kill this

02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:28,581
round?
\kate So we get if we get advantage on

02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:30,921
all just three of them you can get

02:20:28,581 --> 02:20:34,819
basically freebie advantage hits on

02:20:30,921 --> 02:20:40,220
three okay well then I'll go for those

02:20:34,819 --> 02:20:42,949
three and they're dead that's what yeah

02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:44,689
but it's a change 
\dm well you you think

02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:45,261
that you may be more correct than you

02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:49,101
think,

02:20:45,261 --> 02:20:52,970
because as you as you approach, you know

02:20:49,101 --> 02:20:57,261
conscious meditative way to deliver your

02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:58,369
sacred monastic arts underneath these

02:20:57,261 --> 02:21:01,729
masks.

02:20:58,370 --> 02:21:05,450
The skin is not whole. I see okay so

02:21:01,729 --> 02:21:08,171
Brahma has Animate Undead and has

02:21:05,450 --> 02:21:11,900
commanded them to attack Walnut. Alright

02:21:08,171 --> 02:21:15,591
I'm gonna do attacks on I'll start with

02:21:11,899 --> 02:21:18,710
one of the ones Tuck in, folks, gonna be a

02:21:15,591 --> 02:21:20,001
long round. So this is going to be that

02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:22,699
whatever the one that's closest it's

02:21:20,001 --> 02:21:26,541
very fired and I got you and that's

02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:31,211
gonna be a twelve plus seven nineteen

02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:33,829
quite good so that's one hit I will

02:21:31,210 --> 02:21:34,819
enjoy the real damage or just go ahead

02:21:33,829 --> 02:21:43,149
an get a bunch of hits and then walk

02:21:34,819 --> 02:21:45,800
okay that's gonna be a 25 Jesus Christ

02:21:43,149 --> 02:21:48,619
another 25 all right dude

02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:50,720
you know alright so we'll stop Dennis in

02:21:48,620 --> 02:21:53,181
you know save some targets for the rest

02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:58,069
of your party like we do get what it's

02:21:53,181 --> 02:22:00,110
just okay so the last one was a nineteen

02:21:58,069 --> 02:22:02,931
that's also good that's four attacks

02:22:00,110 --> 02:22:04,521
okay and two of them are staff of the

02:22:02,931 --> 02:22:05,601
master two of them are unarmed strike

02:22:04,521 --> 02:22:08,271
okay

02:22:05,601 --> 02:22:12,230
so sad the master they're both 1d8 let's

02:22:08,271 --> 02:22:15,971
see it it's gonna be a 1 d 8 plus 4 it's

02:22:12,229 --> 02:22:19,011
11 mm-hmm that's a 12 that's an 11 and

02:22:15,970 --> 02:22:20,899
that's an 8 right now are you directing

02:22:19,011 --> 02:22:24,381
them all toward individual yeah so

02:22:20,899 --> 02:22:27,591
probably the way it's gonna go is the

02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:30,829
first one's gonna get two strikes from

02:22:27,591 --> 02:22:33,771
my staff pow pow and then immediately

02:22:30,829 --> 02:22:36,021
push off with the staff and then the

02:22:33,771 --> 02:22:39,381
feet go into the face of one and then

02:22:36,021 --> 02:22:42,051
the other you just split yeah exactly

02:22:39,380 --> 02:22:43,159
that's how it works so the first one as

02:22:42,050 --> 02:22:46,729
soon as she's the first one you make a

02:22:43,159 --> 02:22:48,649
note a mental note that the skin is not

02:22:46,729 --> 02:22:50,390
completely covering this person right

02:22:48,649 --> 02:22:53,511
and you make a mental note not to judge

02:22:50,390 --> 02:22:54,681
them you know is it's not there for god

02:22:53,511 --> 02:22:55,101
bless their God bless their little

02:22:54,681 --> 02:22:59,239
hearts

02:22:55,101 --> 02:23:01,971
right right exactly and so the staff wax

02:22:59,239 --> 02:23:05,479
once on one side once on the other side

02:23:01,970 --> 02:23:08,659
the head comes completely off oh you

02:23:05,479 --> 02:23:10,959
then keep off of that still standing

02:23:08,659 --> 02:23:13,299
torso and then

02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:15,309
the two kicks on to other targets cracks

02:23:13,299 --> 02:23:16,778
that's pretty good stuff is that all

02:23:15,309 --> 02:23:23,439
right over the first the first one is

02:23:16,779 --> 02:23:25,750
dead and then the other two don't like

02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:28,300
it the other two deeply resented that's

02:23:25,750 --> 02:23:29,949
fine but dinar blitz in time to go to

02:23:28,299 --> 02:23:32,829
work I will also kill something

02:23:29,949 --> 02:23:35,319
I believe it do it go to one of the area

02:23:32,829 --> 02:23:37,539
it's still in the ferry fire hmm so I

02:23:35,318 --> 02:23:39,639
can advantage yeah you do I'm not gonna

02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:41,859

razzle-dazzle this shopping along it's

02:23:44,889 --> 02:23:49,000
just just right out of that right out of

02:23:46,299 --> 02:23:52,829

02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:54,279

02:25:11,529 --> 02:25:17,470
there's the first slash like I say it's

02:25:15,250 --> 02:25:18,699
just singing the toothbrushes coming

02:25:17,469 --> 02:25:22,358
through just singing through the

02:25:18,699 --> 02:25:24,079
darkness and then it just hisses at you

02:25:22,359 --> 02:25:25,729
from underneath the mask

02:25:24,079 --> 02:25:28,819
and then the sword just connects

02:25:25,729 --> 02:25:31,369
straight through any living target would

02:25:28,819 --> 02:25:33,770
have been sundered by a blow like this

02:25:31,370 --> 02:25:36,440
to the abdomen and then it hisses again

02:25:33,771 --> 02:25:38,870
and raises its blade and then the divine

02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:42,710
smite just right down in the middle of

02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:46,521
this cylinder just just smashes it into

02:25:42,709 --> 02:25:50,289
the ground obliterating it now yeah it's

02:25:46,521 --> 02:25:54,561
true no I killed something that was dead

02:25:50,290 --> 02:25:57,650

02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:59,779
at one of the nearer one or one of the

02:25:57,649 --> 02:26:10,819
newer ones that is not in engulfed in

02:25:59,780 --> 02:26:13,430
fairy fire and goes to fucking work it's

02:26:10,819 --> 02:26:15,289

02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:22,370
media spore shion's

02:26:19,129 --> 02:26:23,989
of this creature just just splitting it

02:26:22,370 --> 02:26:25,521
straight up the middle and kicking it to

02:26:23,989 --> 02:26:27,469
the ground here that one falls down

02:26:25,521 --> 02:26:30,190
hearing all these dice roll makes me

02:26:27,469 --> 02:26:32,599
real glad we didn't attack him yeah

02:26:30,190 --> 02:26:34,430
now if I miss my first one I was like

02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:35,899
he's gonna be so cool I get the streak

02:26:34,430 --> 02:26:38,569
ended I was thinking about how cool he

02:26:35,899 --> 02:26:42,170
was gonna be probably what now the other

02:26:38,569 --> 02:26:45,949

me multi attack two slashes with this

02:26:58,370 --> 02:27:06,590
dagger and as the dagger plunges into

02:27:03,590 --> 02:27:10,489
your shaggy coat, you can feel vital

02:27:06,590 --> 02:27:12,829
energy -- like it's almost a tap, like as

02:27:10,489 --> 02:27:14,810
soon as it goes in you can feel vital

02:27:12,829 --> 02:27:17,539
energy being sucked out into the blade,

02:27:14,810 --> 02:27:21,289
and then it pulls it out blood runs

02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:24,021
freely from the the wound you know my AC

02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:26,870
or anything I just trust me it's pretty

02:27:24,021 --> 02:27:27,440
healthy oh that is gonna be seven points

02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:32,640
of damage

02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:36,899
yikes and it regains that health Oh

yeah good skill that yeah it ain't that

02:27:36,898 --> 02:27:47,639
the other one also descends on you

02:27:40,318 --> 02:27:50,010
what is your AC 1414. This dagger cuts

02:27:47,639 --> 02:27:53,010
deep and plunges in and it just pulls

02:27:50,010 --> 02:27:58,170
hard out of the side, an arc of blood

02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:59,850
following it. That's six points. That is

02:27:58,170 --> 02:28:01,079
the rest of their turn, because you ate

02:27:59,850 --> 02:28:03,600
the rest of them.

02:28:01,079 --> 02:28:04,949

just down right on the haunch and then

02:28:40,829 --> 02:28:46,020
you pull your teeth away just your mouth

02:28:42,779 --> 02:28:48,870

down even a couple inches into the earth

02:33:24,510 --> 02:33:28,290
below and then how do you how do you

02:33:26,670 --> 02:33:29,819
come on phonetically how do you come up

02:33:28,290 --> 02:33:31,590
and finish this off and take this sword

02:33:29,819 --> 02:33:37,829
like a like turn it on its flat side and

02:33:31,590 --> 02:33:40,439
just hammer this exactly cuz it's it's

02:33:37,829 --> 02:33:42,780
hot up its up so high above Rosie yeah

02:33:40,439 --> 02:33:45,148
you can do that without any danger to

02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:46,680
your party member and it taught me to

02:33:45,148 --> 02:33:50,478
it's already lined up yeah just

02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:59,270
piledrive it and I go for the high five

02:33:50,478 --> 02:34:03,989
exactly so it is it is that it is quiet

02:33:59,270 --> 02:34:08,280
devastation it is yeah it is quiet here

02:34:03,989 --> 02:34:11,219
in the base of it and the shapes and

02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:15,960
images that you thought you saw down

02:34:11,219 --> 02:34:18,840
here are no longer apparent when you

02:34:15,959 --> 02:34:22,679
look up it looks as though this these

02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:26,659
reaching vines are simply doing their

02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:31,050
best to survive in this evil place the

02:34:26,659 --> 02:34:34,879
the hastily manufactured altars and

02:34:31,049 --> 02:34:38,779
constructions from this shattered stone

02:34:34,879 --> 02:34:45,420
no longer have this easily readable

02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:49,560
import where's Oak he is wandering

02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:52,829
around like a lost child trying to find

02:34:49,559 --> 02:35:00,000
Brahma so you see him going behind the

02:34:52,829 --> 02:35:04,680
legs of this statue and he begins to

02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:08,969
just stab his knife into the side of the

02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:14,630
leg as he's going around and looking for

02:35:08,969 --> 02:35:20,639
her down here yeah see if I smell her

02:35:14,629 --> 02:35:24,599
see if I smell some strawberries five no

02:35:20,639 --> 02:35:28,439
i don't i eleven plus an 18th yeah

02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:31,979
there is the faintest hint like that

02:35:28,439 --> 02:35:33,420
presents the memory of strawberries in

02:35:31,978 --> 02:35:38,099
summer

02:35:33,420 --> 02:35:39,030
but it is no longer here okay I had

02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:42,540
where could she have gone

02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:44,370
what kind of exits do we see what's

02:35:42,540 --> 02:35:45,960
going on do it come here I say like does

02:35:44,370 --> 02:35:47,340
he know what's going on say what's

02:35:45,959 --> 02:35:50,069
what's the deal dude it's like why is

02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:56,010
she attacking us yeah yeah she he said

02:35:50,069 --> 02:35:57,809
something happened to her in Scala in

02:35:56,010 --> 02:36:00,960
the fight against it didn't in the fight

02:35:57,809 --> 02:36:03,510
against the Tiamat cult she held out

02:36:00,959 --> 02:36:10,079
longer than anyone would have guessed

02:36:03,510 --> 02:36:15,809
and now I think we know why do we why

02:36:10,079 --> 02:36:19,469
why do you saw that mark yeah you saw

02:36:15,809 --> 02:36:23,399
the temple sure you heard the call to

02:36:19,469 --> 02:36:27,059
attack you think she's an agent of

02:36:23,399 --> 02:36:31,079
Tiamat if she isn't she's doing a very

02:36:27,059 --> 02:36:33,059
good impression all right we got we need

02:36:31,079 --> 02:36:37,728
to get out of here and we need to find

02:36:33,059 --> 02:36:42,209
more leads and we need to get to work

02:36:37,728 --> 02:36:42,389
he's right I don't know okay here's the

02:36:42,209 --> 02:36:45,209
thing

02:36:42,389 --> 02:36:47,039
I don't think I trust Oak I don't know

02:36:45,209 --> 02:36:48,750
why Brahma would attack Walnut but I

02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:50,610
certainly don't trust Oak why are we

02:36:48,750 --> 02:36:53,700
trusting his word plus he just got his

02:36:50,610 --> 02:36:55,409
wild card license revoked so this fool

02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:58,500
might be making it up I go back we go

02:36:55,409 --> 02:37:00,420
back into a one-legged sorry I'm not

02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:02,700

don't see how truthful in sight yeah

02:37:08,939 --> 02:37:12,600
yeah absolutely

02:37:09,689 --> 02:37:16,850

he's saying now that's interesting

02:37:38,939 --> 02:37:43,110
do I detect that there is a madness

02:37:41,610 --> 02:37:46,091
about him

02:37:43,110 --> 02:37:49,421
does it seem irrational

02:37:46,091 --> 02:37:56,081

02:37:49,421 --> 02:38:02,800
