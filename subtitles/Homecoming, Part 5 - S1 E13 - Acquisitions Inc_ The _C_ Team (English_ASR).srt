they'll process my else's sake Oh real

52
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:16,289
some kind of emergence

00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,169
is a great listen to it on a symbol for

54
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,818
Dragon I no longer cough a little that's

55
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,408
right there's something there they do

56
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:27,030
their own way they do it their own way

57
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:28,739
down there yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly

58
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,509
wish you know it's like it's like um

59
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,378
like thing you learn on your own

60
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:36,090
oh yeah or it's like Angelina Jolie in

61
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:39,239
the wanted movie where it's secure

62
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,920
visible like whoa yeah all right anyway

63
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,340
oh well now I'm thinking about that

64
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:49,548
freak a book will come back listen when

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:55,408
last we saw our heroes they had found a

66
00:02:49,549 --> 00:03:00,540
chamber deep below the strange city of

67
00:02:55,408 --> 00:03:02,548
NEMA's ear and this chamber housed and a

68
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:06,750
creature that called itself an elder

69
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:11,150
brain the you know known to be the final

70
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:14,340
stage in the evolution of a mind flayer

71
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,389
but it was quite at your mercy indeed it

72
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:22,620
was sort of suspended on a kind of rack

73
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:24,719
almost like a drying skin in the Sun too

74
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:30,449
clearly diminished from its absolute

75
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:33,810
power but I did have a task that it

76
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:35,459
wanted the party to manage because in

77
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,239
its current state there was distantly

78
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:44,659
things that it cannot do now I am

79
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,799
skipping over a painful moment for some

80
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:49,979
something did happen to the horse

81
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,370
coriander and then when I went on to

82
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:56,698
Twitter people said that I had done it

83
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,489
you did we did do it but I but that's

84
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,290
not true I I am you know what I mean

85
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,120
it's like you're just hard to stop well

86
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,918
think it's into it mystery now here's a

87
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,849
limit I prefer if you're going back it's

88
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,060
like a vision

89
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:11,068
I am simply imagine that I have poked my

90
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,019
head through and I'm just relating these

91
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:15,568
facts to you this is all actually

92
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,009
happening somewhere that's the best way

93
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:18,569
to think of it I'm not arguing with you

94
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:20,339
but I'm also saying that you made that

95
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,228
thing happens somewhere but you don't

96
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,869
like listen think about the fullness of

97
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:27,069
time think about how rich and complex

98
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,110
all these interweaving may be

99
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:32,529
who can say in the fullness of time

100
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:37,900
coriander is dead I can say I know I

101
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:40,539
know I'm not telling you that I killed

102
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:42,129
it I learned in their own group

103
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,970
backdated a word I learned it from

104
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:47,860
watching you

105
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:50,680
alright I'm going there yeah BAM that's

106
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,420
a lot women exactly exactly you know let

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,590
it read on your leisure we've all seen

108
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,800
that movie I know listen

109
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:58,299
um we're gonna talk about the crevasse

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,199
now or later is that well right now

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,410
we've been yeah any no it's not like

112
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,099
that

113
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,689
um oh god that's got to be a Google Maps

114
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,450
plugin that's all I'm saying bare

115
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:15,459
minimum so let's think about it like

116
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:17,620
this you are now before this entity and

117
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:19,709
last time it became a sort of strange

118
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,620
game of 20 questions

119
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:25,930
this entity's intellect is vast and so

120
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,899
the thing that happened at the end of

121
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,389
the adventure last time was that you

122
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:33,789
used it basically to check in on things

123
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,699
that would happen all through your

124
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:41,730
character's careers functionally arles

125
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:46,379
truth Korean beef indeed but now you are

126
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:50,950
all together in it's sort of you know

127
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:54,069
dank fillet and you have a guy need you

128
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:57,550
have agreed to undertake its task which

129
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:59,920
consists of the destruction of what it

130
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,069
calls roots which I think generally

131
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,020
speaking would be a strange a strange

132
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,909
way to describe the foundation of a

133
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:11,709
building but it's never there who knows

134
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:16,720
why there are three of them and he has

135
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:21,299
offered a guide to help you get to each

136
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:26,040
of these places anytime you are ready to

137
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:30,400
explore the undercarriage of Mnemosyne I

138
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,230
don't have an opportunity to rest and

139
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,459
get our going fits all back in business

140
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,930
we just take a nap right in front of the

141
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,719
brain can I tell you guys the name of

142
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,740
the quest I give this across maybe even

143
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,660
though it doesn't have well in the

144
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,430
document sir it's called

145
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:49,510
rootin tootin root busting is stupid I

146
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,730
love it has a light flute implicit the

147
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:55,779
main thing is that you're having it fun

148
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:57,910
no amazing or that everyone at home is

149
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:00,309
having fun he said I'm having fun that's

150
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,200
right that's the key but it also is very

151
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,600
walnut it's just like you know it's it's

152
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,430
her book and she can write where the

153
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,610
she wants to in there who has no

154
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:13,360
consequence but yeah how you manage how

155
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,270
you manage your your time before this I

156
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,600
mean the reality is that if I recall

157
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:22,209
correctly the party is not doing a

158
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,640
hundred percent great know right now is

159
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,899
that what the short-run not I was going

160
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,300
to say why not a long rest

161
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:30,429
why not why not why don't we stay here

162
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,480
as were a great weeks we asked the brand

163
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:37,240

rats and you can you can see them sort

228
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,120
of skittering around even up onto the

229
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:27,170
roots and over the surface dumping what

230
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,629
appears to be thimble sized buckets of

231
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:32,000
moisture just along the servant of the

232
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:35,659

some gaudy brains we all know they're um

but essentially just even while you're

243
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:06,259
having this conversation with it

244
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,690

like inside of a lava lamp just how that

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,039
are constantly just sort of orbs pulling

248
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:19,039
themselves away that's what's happening

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,879
going to send us some good news

314
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,720
can I ask elder Brian if he was

315
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,120
responsible

316
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,490
it was responsible for the wraps that we

317
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,120
had to eliminate as part of our quest to

318
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:35,220
be here were those his wrap my rats are

319
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,129
those you see before you okay my

320
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,629
raspberry portion of myself right so we

321
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:43,799
were hired to come here and eliminate

322
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:48,480
the rat problem but that is that you the

323
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:51,778
problem of your existence I have a

324
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,720
theory about this okay I didn't spend a

325
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:58,439
lot of time observing mayor for Nelson

326
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,550
Gore because he's an idiot and I felt

327
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,290
confident that I would not learn a lot I

328
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:08,579
think that he dealt with the wrong rat

329
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:10,919
problem okay cryptic what do you mean by

330
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:15,150
that I think he was issued a specific

331
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:18,599
directive to manage rats those rats you

332
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:21,860
see in my Nimbus here I think that

333
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:25,019
because he is an idiot he managed a

334
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,539
mundane rat problem okay you are a

335
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,710
separate rat problem from the rat

336
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:32,709
problem that we found

337
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,680
I don't see a problem it's good problems

338
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,360
my opinion would always lovely rats okay

339
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,539
checking just I want to make sure those

340
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,950
weren't it's rat crowd surfing around

341
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,449
like you don't lay on the floor you just

00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,449
grip like you imagine a scenario to

473
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:29,759
imagine a scenario where this serpent

474
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,730

475
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:36,538

heat and he's paid for by the school

485
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:05,960
it's all your IEP so the way that it

486
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:08,240
works is ECL head poked out so you think

487
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,340
under ordinary circumstances a rat would

488
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:16,160
be welcome appreciated but there's

489
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:18,439
something about to use rats but is not

490
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,920

00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:29,389
tongue slip out of a little crease in

495
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:32,000
the pouch it's kind of just kind of

496
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:35,480

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:21,380
just up by the up by the edge of the

514
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:25,250
cloak opens its mouth right by the ear

515
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:28,100
you can feel this in the hot air coming

516
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:31,910
from it and it begins to rattle off and

517
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:35,599
in its whatever its method of

518
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:37,400
communication is and you think it's

519
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:41,379
almost like it's almost like a stream of

520
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,250
data it's just everything that happened

521
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,890
time-stamped from when he was

522
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,809
annihilated just everything he

523
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,500
experienced like every state change

524
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:54,409
that's upset every every every every

525
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,569
medium he passed through living and

526
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,720
non-living every dark dream literally

527
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:02,419
stored on him on the vellum right it's

528
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,579
like playing a record and then and then

529
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:08,450
when he reaches the current moment he

530
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:08,689
withdraws himself that's choice all

531
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,960
right

532
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,679

533
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,200
sleepy

534
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,509

535
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,690

538
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,340
there just like there is basically the

539
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:29,929
dreams that you have are like that you

540
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,970
meet the sorts of people you would meet

541
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:34,100
in a dream and you do everything that

542
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,548
you would do in a normal dream but it's

543
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:40,878
all on your belly and the way that you

544
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:43,308
go from place to place and do all the

545
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:44,689
normal dream things is just by crawling

546
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:48,378
place to place it's like there's some

547
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:51,200
ceiling above maybe a foot or two above

548
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:53,449
the ground that you can't get up past

549
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,519
all your dreams just pushed down yeah

550
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,298
doesn't it deeply compress not that

551
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,038
different for me

552
00:24:56,298 --> 00:25:02,509
yeah she's her own kind of those kind of

553
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:07,398
dreams yes she's just very small I made

554
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:09,440
a bad thing but but I get that way at it

555
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,709
you you get not grown you get your you

556
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,990
feast upon your your full rest I'm

557
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:22,579
feeling you get up.get so you're hit

it's always no it's always a way to get

562
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,839
no okay right like it's noisy on all the

563
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,819
notes during a short rest

564
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:36,888
you can expend these hit nice and top

565
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:38,808
yourself up that's their purpose

566
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:40,939
yeah isn't it short rest every day this

567
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:41,450
is I think a long rest is the right

568
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,190
choice

569
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,808
I mean I need a top-off big-time

570
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,980
breakfast yeah you need to be route of

571
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:51,200
spells and other life okay exactly about

572
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,589
it exactly so you taught back up all

573
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,830
your spell's you ready to go you you you

574
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:59,418
wake back up and there's no alteration

575
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:01,638
in the chamber as near as you can tell

576
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,179
the basic ambient light is the same I

577
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:07,699
mean you have to think for a moment and

578
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:11,119
assess yourself and verify that you have

579
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,990
secured some kind of rest yeah this is

580
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:17,449
this is a timeless sort of strange vault

581
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,019
of a chamber like we all slept at the

582
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,240
same time we're just super trusting okay

583
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:24,980
we're going to get your OPI design evil

584
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,289
brain and rats oh well they won't turn

585
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,500
on

586
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:30,509
either just like yeah evil yeah he needs

587
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,619
us what is evil what is evil in this

588
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:37,740
crazy workaday world we are yeah yeah I

589
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:39,989
mean other than we are the reactions

590
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,670
incorporated I'm not evil read large

591
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:43,859
desperate Valley branch yeah I think

592
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,019
excess incorporated us a thing for Table

593
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:49,559
Talk I didn't know that it was even out

594
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,789
okay okay I'm done done what else all

595
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:56,069
right I got my starter stepping right

596
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:58,289
now we get it we wake right soon so we

597
00:26:56,069 --> 00:27:01,019
were told about a guy are we ready to

598
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:04,230
proceed and who will guide us what will

599
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:08,190
guide us what is one of these is what am

600
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:10,710
i continues okay okay we know what you

601
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,660
want to follow put a little hat on them

602
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:16,640
oh you'll know we should put a hat on it

603
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:21,630
so you can see up above up above adage

604
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:25,800
chamber again like like the rest of the

605
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:28,950
construction here is is non-traditional

606
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:31,139
in shape and texture and it's even

607
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:38,160
stranger the farther down you get

608
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:40,080
beneath Nana's ear so up from as I said

609
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,500
you pass through multiple sort of

610
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,699
illusory walls on the way here along

611
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,029
with the rest of the twists and turns

612
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,390
which of course roseyd singer could you

613
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:53,639
know navigate expertly but you just see

614
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:57,090
sort of holes and passages almost like a

615
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:03,050
honeycomb in the in the ceiling of the

616
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:10,019
of Elder Brian's chamber and essentially

617
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:13,889
you see a mass of his servants the froth

618
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:19,589
and spill over beneath one of these and

619
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:23,720
then you see them form atop one another

620
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:29,099
you see them form a kind of stair that

621
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:30,740
you can use to exit in one place okay

622
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:35,549
like that

623
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:37,859
I'll go first I guess some of you

624
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:39,990
you're looking up this Shasta can I see

625
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,759
the daylight or it turn some other

626
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,740
directions yeah yeah it's just it's just

627
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,740
another place essentially this is a

628
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:52,289
nexus point deep in the guts of this

629
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,769
town

630
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:59,220
I can't stifle my mmm when I step on the

631
00:28:55,769 --> 00:29:00,299
zombies plush rat yeah this some gift

632
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,069
but not as much as you would expect

633
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,569
right and it's like you don't know what

634
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:06,450
what the etiquette is as far as like

635
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:08,129
doing step on the brain right you know

636
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,759
what it's like you know you don't know

637
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,920
like like where you exist in this

638
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:16,049
hierarchy of politeness I step on one

639
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,440
step and it's really unpleasant for me

640
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:23,029
so I look at walnut and like can I ride

641
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,440
I mean I'm fine with this oh you love

642
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:26,970
destroying in my life that's not

643
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,799
entirely true quiet

644
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,269
Rosie is asking her let you like look

645
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:36,329
over and well it's like are you ready to

646
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:38,129
be put on yeah ready backpack okay I get

647
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:40,379
halfway up the stairs I'm watching

648
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,970
Dinaric realizing good I'm at Morty ways

649
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,650
I'm just wondering came through rats

650
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:47,250
like they do why to deal with it see

651
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:51,509
yeah they're like yeah I'm like sorry

652
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:55,609
sorry they died under be consistent on

653
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:57,690
grid' yeah Kevin was a cracker and

654
00:29:55,609 --> 00:30:01,079
apologizing to the rappers they died as

655
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:03,960
I killed them yeah so you wait so at

656
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:07,169
least I can do it step by step as they

657
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,140
as they move up this stair and out into

658
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:11,509
the tunnel proper above you begin to

659
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,120
make your way and it's almost like

660
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,890
stepping on a balloon like you walk up

661
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,359
and then you see like the shape that

662
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,870
they have tried so dutifully to

663
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:24,299
manufacture for you it's sort of

664
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:27,089
distending underneath it and then once

665
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:30,299
they sort of calibrate themselves to

666
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:32,339
your draconic heft and a couple more

667
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:36,240
contingents come over and help bolster

668
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:38,819
the the lowest portions of this you're

669
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,430
able to get out just a couple steps past

670
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:44,879
you can see that that was probably all

671
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:48,000
they were capable of and you see you see

672
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,510
you see just collapse then you see more

673
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,019
fears of rats begin to move out here and

674
00:30:51,509 --> 00:31:02,460
there but there is a tiny rat perhaps

675
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:04,879
the tiniest cranium rat who held on to

676
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,370
the edge and then who doesn't split up

677
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,390
and then he gets out in front of the

678
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:12,409
party

679
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,030
and begins to sort of like hiding bounce

680
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:17,700
okay

681
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:19,710
Rosie's in love yeah yeah listen heat

682
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,740
and he he is ready for that love he is

683
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,779
ready to be a vessel for that look

684
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,240
something you can win us over with a red

685
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:28,500
after what you did or what if it was a

686
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,779
really big round what if I could rig a

687
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,599
real card what if I could read so big

688
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:35,849
what if one of you I couldn't kill it

689
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,549

yeah okay it's very much I know that is

700
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:17,149
Ignasi a ting so you find your way

701
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:23,719
through this tunnel smooth balls nice

702
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:28,950
premium all night okay

703
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:33,240
bizarre mixture of stones and by a dense

704
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:34,740
root mat that clings to the walls that

705
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:42,660
you're traveling through hate that guy

706
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:45,420
yeah just intrude mad rude man but you

707
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:49,170
hear you hear something down the

708
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:51,960
corridor that sounds almost like a wind

709
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,730
chime like imagine if you could make

710
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,480
vision it was possible to make a wind

711
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:59,700
chime out of incredibly large metal

712
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,110
cylinders instead of the ones that are

713
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,650
typically done

714
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:08,039
imagine something like a free-floating

715
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:12,990
pipe organ yeah and you begin to hear

716
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:14,279
these notes sail down the tunnel and

717
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:18,450
then you can see that this towel

718
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,549
ultimately opens up into a room your

719
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,769
best guess is that it's almost an L

720
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:25,169
shape with a long part of the elbows in

721
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:28,799
front of you and then a corner extends

722
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:33,930
out to the right you can see the room

723
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:38,990
itself is loaded with columns and it's

724
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:41,759
also stuffed with a root structure so

725
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:45,900
dense in places and so fine and others

726
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:48,839
that it's almost like a spider web the

727
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:52,830
columns themselves seem to be blanketed

728
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:56,490
in this sort of fragile mesh but that's

729
00:33:52,829 --> 00:34:00,859
coupled with what you can see sort of

730
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:03,750
between a row of these regularly placed

731
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:08,460
columns you can see that there is a

732
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:11,519
thick trunk that extends entirely

733
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:15,269
through the room straight through the

734
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:18,409
middle and it's its construction is you

735
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:22,469
can recall when you were with the Brian

736
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:24,750
you could see that the construction of

737
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:27,989
the roots that have sort of pierced and

738
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:31,849
suspended it in that you know and what

739
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:34,439
must be torment of some kind

740
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:36,329
they have different sort of materials

741
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,200
that make them up one of them almost had

742
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:42,539
a metallic sheen due to its mystic

743
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:46,619
construction so these are not so these

744
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:50,279
roots are not winding around metal

745
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:52,349
columns but I assume have air movement

746
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,140
or they're not like banging into each

747
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:57,869
other like a wind chime no no no there's

748
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,690
to be a stringy mesh that extends out

749
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:03,509
from it so just like a traditional root

750
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:06,360
how once it's once it's defined and

751
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:11,240
established there's that exactly yeah

752
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:13,400
that's sort of that sort of army of fine

753
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:14,929
that come out into the soil so this is

754
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,030
why I'm an idiot

755
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:18,559
this is the real room so these are the

756
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,869
sacred these are the roots we need to

757
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,820
get rid of yeah this is this is you if

758
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:25,240
you have it you have been brought to the

759
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:29,390
live in diameter

760
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:33,349
and there seems to be one central tuber

761
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:36,079
one big boy and it if stretching

762
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:39,460
horizontally toward us it is basically

763
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,860
cutting across the room okay I see

764
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:45,050
imagine this sort of in the middle of

765
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,150
that l-shape that sort of bisects the

766
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,519
corner that's where that root is coming

767
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:52,460
through do we have reason to believe

768
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,289
that this root going to follow the the

769
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,480
core of it would take us to Brian and

770
00:35:54,289 --> 00:36:00,889
Pierce him that seems that seems

771
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:05,119
sensible okay hmm I do a perception

772
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:07,250
check on the this room he's trapped yeah

773
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,000
yeah absolutely you hear another you

774
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:13,940
hear another cascade of these wind chime

775
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,329
sounds sort of bouncing around in the

776
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:20,960
room and then commingling themselves

777
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:23,469
into tunnel that you're in a 16-time

778
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,369
that's great you're trying to assist I

779
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:27,108
kinda want to make sure that this room

780
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,780
is safe to enter so I'm looking for

781
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:34,069
obvious dangers you don't yeah you don't

782
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:35,480
you don't see any obvious means there's

783
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,640
nothing there's nothing clear from the

784
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,130
from what you might call the dark foil a

785
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:44,150
okay

786
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:46,789

787
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,950
opportunity to Safeway yeah could we

first oh yeah we feel it's a great just

791
00:36:54,108 --> 00:37:00,650
to set up all the traps yeah exactly

792
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:03,579
hey you didn't like these damn landline

793
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:07,099
okay fine it's got it on the head here

794
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:08,710

00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:43,390
freer purposes cartographer the initial

807
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:47,480
room the leftmost part of this L shape

808
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:51,048
you can see six of these columns at

809
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,759
regular intervals basically two four six

810
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:55,219
okay

811
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:57,349
and then beyond in the rest of the L

812
00:37:55,219 --> 00:38:01,038
there is another four back there but

813
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:04,749

Rose one no this this when you extend ei

832
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:10,130
even into the real world

833
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:15,739
I'm the zone between the two columns on

834
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:17,480
the right you you you move in expert

835
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:20,630
lessly not even a creak from the leather

836
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,498
straps you place your hand against it

837
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:29,180
and then you look back you look past and

838
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:32,929
you are there immediately when the

839
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:34,279
denizen of this place clearly on some

840
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:37,409
kind of

841
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,280
has just is just now passing out a

842
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:49,129
vision he's not looking this way this is

843
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:55,320
a that it is essentially like a massive

844
00:39:49,130 --> 00:40:01,380
angry metal statue hmm my favorite kind

845
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:05,190
of message angry mob is I'm like yes

846
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:08,400
should we go okay what do you see Phoebe

847
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:13,050

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:16,200
Arizona you graduated anyway it I can

849
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:19,769
you fit that halfling Carmen oh I don't

851
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:24,780
for that anniversary so they eat your

852
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:27,210
Pacific near the speed it defeated

853
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,640
something this is clearly if it is made

854
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:35,550
of what it looks you made of this is

855
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:37,619
this is an incredible piece of work even

856
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,900
standing absolutely still without a good

857
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:41,759
night player down them yeah even

858
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,360
standing absolutely still it would be an

859
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,490
incredible work but it is it is

860
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:49,740
ambulatory and you can see Kohl's sort

861
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:54,059
of burning in the math how tall are we

862
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:55,859
talking oh it's very very tall underdone

863
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:58,049
it is fifteen feet tall

864
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:01,320
alright towering that's a big boy you

865
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:03,480
see that already look at least 100 feet

866
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,330
at all yes anything taller than me is

867
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,940
100 feet it's like skeleton is got to be

868
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:10,980
like in our size six stories no it's

869
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,990
dinner size and then there's people yeah

870
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,099
and then there's anything bigger and

871
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:19,529
that includes everything from an

872
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:21,539
alligator to a god yeah absolutely so

873
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:26,490
you put a business a so it's strangely

874
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:29,400
the feet from this device don't make any

875
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:34,739
sound as they move but you still hear

876
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:36,930
this this musical clamor just come in

877
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,569
who knows what is generating it but it

878
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:40,568
seems to be generated specifically by

879
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,619
this

880
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:46,719
ah instrument mm-hmm and it's or it's

881
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:49,059
originating from this metal file it is

882
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:52,749
in fact and as it passes you can see you

883
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:55,959
can hear that music just sort of playing

884
00:41:52,748 --> 00:41:58,629
off there off the rest of these halls

885
00:41:55,958 --> 00:42:01,088
and off of the columns and is it seem to

886
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:05,489
be patrolling this room it is it is in

887
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:07,838
fact it has just moved past the route

888
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:10,088
that is hang that it's hanging under has

889
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,608
to duck slightly and it's going to that

890
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:15,038
shape press passing left okay they're

891
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:17,018
moving into the top of the L okay got it

892
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,880
could I see your map cartographer you

893
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:20,428
can but I'm not very don't that's very

894
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:26,380
good let's thank you

895
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:29,559
very good ma'am great map so all right

896
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,630
um so you're did you sneak back in or

897
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,640
are you just like yeah crouched in the

898
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,959
in the entry didn't see me before so

899
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:39,338
well I'm fine where I am

900
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:41,438
okay uh uh I think we need some stealth

901
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:43,239
yeah you think you know he's away

902
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:46,509
writing around the corner yeah they're

903
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:48,309
like you closest clear yeah we got to

904
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:49,809
destroy this route before he gets but

905
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:51,130
like without him detecting that's right

906
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:56,798
cuz he looks like he could kick our butt

907
00:42:51,130 --> 00:43:00,209
right yeah mmm all that you say is

908
00:42:56,798 --> 00:43:06,489
murder him we're very good at one thing

909
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:10,978
apparently there's okay get work very

910
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:10,978
okay one thing we do it alive

911
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:17,679
okay I'm gonna advocate we stealth in

912
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:21,728
here I give you a path up trace darkness

913
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:24,099
combo if half of that traces the way go

914
00:43:21,728 --> 00:43:26,649
for now but if it comes if goes

915
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:30,818
down then I can darkness and hopefully

916
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:32,798
it will go this can I perceive the route

917
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:34,418
like I want to look at this but what do

918
00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:36,909
you what do you want anime in Ruth yeah

919
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:38,558
I want to see if it's like go for it if

920
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:41,019
it rectified it's going to require a

921
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,798
team effort or one person can get in and

922
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:45,248
sabotage it

923
00:43:41,798 --> 00:43:48,849
I am all about this let's see it Graham

924
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:50,828
eight it's a route yep definitely

925
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:53,199
organic matter it's stick I mean it's

926
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,829
this I mean it's nice you saw you hate

927
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,818
too

928
00:43:53,829 --> 00:44:00,818
to cease thanks so as you're looking at

929
00:43:57,818 --> 00:44:02,498
it you can see from around this edge

930
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:07,058
it's actually what happened that's how I

931
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:10,828
got sprung sound let's take a true it is

932
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:14,528
the winter listen listen if there's not

933
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:15,369
incredibly hot route fanart after this

934
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:18,190
yeah

935
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:22,088
listen how do we destroy this room this

936
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:23,200
is like this is almost like that I got

937
00:44:22,088 --> 00:44:25,869
it you seen around the edge I mean over

938
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:29,739
on the right side it's sending out but

939
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:31,358
this is like a tree trunk okay like this

940
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:34,208
this root coming down like you don't

941
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:37,869
know what building this sustains but

942
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:40,989
this is this is not you don't know if

943
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:42,670
two of you could do is this organic and

it is we're going to let out palak one

945
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:49,358
yeah yeah this is in general the

946
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:52,719
materials that make up newest areas

947
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:56,348
construction our bizarre hybrid of

948
00:44:52,719 --> 00:45:00,699
metals and stone okay okay that's it has

949
00:44:56,349 --> 00:45:03,640
it has it has a machine concrete it has

950
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:05,949
a metallic sheen to it and is also

951
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:09,219
incredibly thick what could burn away

952
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:11,079
what could dissolve ja I bought really

953
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:15,009

a head I mean this is this is intimate

984
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:50,110
this is gonna be an intimate venue for

985
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:53,170
stealth maneuvers okay we can hide

986
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:56,220
behind the column when and when when

987
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:59,950
john-boy comes back what if we did uh

991
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,080
ready okay so guys that she citizen

992
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,539

00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:16,000
thank you so far okay that's him and

995
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:18,069
then this is the route and this is us

996
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,380
and we're like ah but you can't get us

997
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:22,420
dinner so something annoying Sizzlin off

998
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,760
and then he's like oh I'm gonna kill you

999
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,579
but actually he hits the roof yeah yeah

1000
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:31,150
although I did just cast across that

1001
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:34,929
tree yeah so if you can dispel it well

1002
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:36,639
so it really is just a +2 stealth you

1003
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:38,649
know check I promise that if you jump

1004
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:39,969
around oh look at the rest of us could

1005
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,610
be stealthy and then the other person

1006
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:46,239
could delenn but I'm not gonna use this

1007
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:48,340
word but be sure we good I can kick in

1008
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,439
the back I'm not the most agile though

1009
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,500
but mad most agile person should jump

1010
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:59,889
out of the way right yeah and I direct

1011
00:47:53,500 --> 00:48:02,500
velvet to to run out and make sure you

1012
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:04,239
keep an eye on this thing when it starts

1013
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,090
to walk back this direction come back

1014
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:09,339
give me a tunnel okay so we'll know give

1015
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:11,740
me a gentle rise on cheeks even more one

1016
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,240
caress other kind of kisses yeah you

1017
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:15,279
call him velvet but you doesn't have the

1018
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:17,409
velvet real well with it don't

1019
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,540
yeah that's what it is the day by happy

1020
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:23,799
for the soft gray five kisses if he's

1021
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:26,679
coming so Laura people yeah so that's

1022
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,150
five you did we could get more cooks you

1023
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:31,509
might want to get you might want to get

1024
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:35,019
a piece of fabric just to maintain this

1025
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:37,510
or no in my mind I took that fabric from

1026
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:39,429
the blood even a pen yeah it's not buy

1027
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,380
anymore Eve I make sure you clean a room

1028
00:48:39,429 --> 00:48:43,000
good especially I thought employers keep

1029
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,820
it pulled eyes closed and when we need

1030
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,550
to see them yeah with my laundry right

1031
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,800
now he doesn't see no this is a super

1032
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,690
cool plant is also a gamble therefore

1033
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,280
noncorporeal therefore he could distract

1034
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,829
them sing and run right there

1035
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,950
that's true yeah why put us in the way

1036
00:48:56,829 --> 00:49:00,880
yeah every time I give any alizarin

1037
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:02,199
abilities like where you could like I

1038
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,039
have I mean I've got a manifest

1039
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:05,169
something in front of I have

1040
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,029
prestidigitation I could we could light

1041
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:09,909
a torch or something I have found that

1042
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:11,950
Andy hold it yes I've minor illusion as

1043
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:13,599
well a kid we could hide behind these

1044
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,339
columns and manipulate this without even

1045
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,460
showing up well he kind of far away

1046
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:20,829
right now we all just go hang on we'll

1047
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,179
see we'll see what happens you or we

1048
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:23,199
could just stay hidden the whole time I

1049
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:24,730
guess there is there is

1050
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,919
wow you are interesting let's see if you

1051
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:29,050

staying hidden and try to do this from

1059
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,219

00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:47,349
do that in a Frank and then bangarang

1083
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:53,440
can write go bang clang clang go high

1084
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:56,679
why my trial depressed I like it all the

1085
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,440
way back to yeah so you saw the crew the

1086
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:03,639
crew this is sort of huddled in this

1087
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:07,869
side corridor while the music is growing

1088
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:12,309
louder as this contraction is beginning

1089
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:16,779
to move toward the foyer mouth you have

1090
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:18,099
sent young velvet out dude of leaving

1091
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:22,510
through I'm busy

1092
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:26,139
yeah why you as soon as soon as young

1093
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:30,360
velvet is sent forth to sort of navigate

1094
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:37,299
this pac-man maze through these columns

1095
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:42,280
the music substantially increases in

1096
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:45,789
volume and the lethargy that you saw to

1097
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,900
melts away it this is not a slope this

1098
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:49,719
is not a slow frame

1099
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:55,630
excellent this is not a fine size and

1100
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:58,209
the oak drops so big whoa whoa so so now

1101
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:00,369
the footballs are heavy behind velvet

1102
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,409
you are sending velvet out with the

1103
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:05,019
cover and the torch yeah little flower

1104
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:07,500
blossom has the eye but you see

1105
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:12,759
something strange as velvet goes out

1106
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:19,210
between the columns and beneath the root

1107
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:24,970
torch held aloft you see the you're you

1108
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:29,980
know mechanical interloper stop turn and

1109
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:34,000
then you hear what sounds like a like a

1110
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:35,740
furnace door creeks open and then you

1111
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,608
can see from behind

1112
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:47,608
even this mass

1113
00:52:38,608 --> 00:52:52,048
of emerald gas that floods out and then

1114
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:54,449
you can you can see Velvets tiny cape

1115
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:57,869
sort of billow and you can see the flame

1116
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:59,848
on the you can see on the flame the

1117
00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:03,450
flame of the torch become a green flame

1118
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:06,630
um as it as it is exposed to whatever

1119
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:09,659
this compound is okay and then yttrium

1120
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:11,999
Burgess it okay I have a fine click onto

1121
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:14,518
the dragon date I would like this no

1122
00:53:11,998 --> 00:53:16,498
listen so the bit of green flame what

1123
00:53:14,518 --> 00:53:18,508
was once it burns out of this compound

1124
00:53:16,498 --> 00:53:21,659
yeah it returns to its original color

1125
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:24,960
and then you hear that Creek closing

1126
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:29,009
again and then it begins to take off

1127
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:32,639
toward velvet okay so it knows the drill

1128
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:35,159
he's going to run over to which part of

1129
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,618
the relief did you like just whatever is

1130
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:41,969
the best in a stereo first no papers on

1131
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:45,660
it Dixon what Big Daddy see yeah so he

1132
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:48,778
got to get turn up the mouth done it

1133
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:50,778
kind of weird there um so yeah yeah you

1134
00:53:48,778 --> 00:53:53,608
remember that sorry

1135
00:53:50,778 --> 00:53:56,670
he's just tantalizing himself yeah

1136
00:53:53,608 --> 00:53:59,518
like well flam is near this route is

1137
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:03,059
that bad do you not like that to put it

1138
00:53:59,518 --> 00:54:05,608
out stamp it out you see you see but

1139
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:08,369
velvet is low yeah velvet is low to the

1140
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:14,848
ground and you see your mechanical

1141
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:16,890
interloper kick straight through you see

1142
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:19,079
the foot come back and then just go

1143
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:22,440
straight through and then there's just a

1144
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:25,079
cloth at the end of the foot and it

1145
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:28,499
brings down he stomps on a couple times

1146
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:30,180
trying to get it off of his boot but I'm

1147
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:32,548
good though I don't know I might have

1148
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:35,190
got involved over just still

1149
00:54:32,548 --> 00:54:38,159
instantiated but the cloth is gone um

1150
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:42,720
but as a target velvet is very low yeah

1151
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:44,639
okay your illusion okay what kind of

1152
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:46,108
illusions are we are we going forward do

1153
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:46,498
we want to distract him back into the

1154
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:47,940
room

1155
00:54:46,498 --> 00:54:48,988
or do we want to have him do it well

1156
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,849
these right here's a route right now

1157
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:51,278
okay what do I put something like all

1158
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:54,338
over

1159
00:54:51,278 --> 00:54:55,958
root like oh yeah he's on the roof okay

1160
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:58,208
really no backlash

1161
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:59,948
you ever see the most what looked like

1162
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:03,938
he's going to go after anything that

1163
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:05,139
moves do some dancing was law everything

1164
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:05,828
was there doing about the little

1165
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:08,679
sparkles

1166
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:11,798
yeah the sparkle try dancing lights or I

1167
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:13,689
could do a minor illusion I could put

1168
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:16,119
another illusion of velvet even up

1169
00:55:13,688 --> 00:55:17,858
higher on the on the branch and as

1170
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,380
though to say haha you didn't get much

1171
00:55:17,858 --> 00:55:20,558
we got was making extra angry yes all

1172
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,689
right

1173
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,369
okay wait let's do it what's that again

1174
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:25,328
I'm going to just do a minor illusion

1175
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:27,189
okay I love it

1176
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:29,559
higher up and it hopes that we'd get a

1177
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:31,989
hit that's okay I see like of a cloth

1178
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:34,509
like yeah man that's around us it yeah

1179
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:35,588
yeah that acceptable absolutely okay I

1180
00:55:34,509 --> 00:55:38,079
will do that

1181
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:42,909
that is nothing range they're talking

1182
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:46,929
about misery yeah yeah a little people

1183
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:49,749
are like middle finger right at yeah

1184
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:53,679
yeah yeah that's not your nose got real

1185
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:56,738
king whoa I love it oh yeah it is driven

1186
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:59,439
mad excellent I mean in the manner of a

1187
00:55:56,739 --> 00:56:03,938
bull was exactly where I was going to

1188
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:06,699
exactly listen this wriggling cloth

1189
00:56:03,938 --> 00:56:09,188
which seats the class up here looks down

1190
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:12,338
and sees the cloth down there it looks

1191
00:56:09,188 --> 00:56:14,828
up and sees this cloth and then in a

1192
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:16,900
motion it reaches up it could have been

1193
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:19,269
a stove pipe or something like that off

1194
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,880
the back to handle the massive sword

1195
00:56:19,268 --> 00:56:25,478
yeah then tilts out and in one motion

1196
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:29,499
pulls forward slices forward and it

1197
00:56:25,478 --> 00:56:33,968
probably catches half its half stuck

1198
00:56:29,498 --> 00:56:34,448
tank in this route okay okay well we're

1199
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:36,039
halfway there

1200
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:38,318
well I don't think it can destroy my

1201
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:40,479
illusion so I think I'll have to work

1202
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:43,208
pretty hard yeah I think I think the

1203
00:56:40,478 --> 00:56:45,788
illusions just gonna stick around the

1204
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:47,228
quickie chance our yeah yeah yeah look

1205
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:48,579
so good I look like a dodged and came

1206
00:56:47,228 --> 00:56:49,418
told me to to give the middle finger

1207
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:52,289
whoa

1208
00:56:49,418 --> 00:56:52,288
this robot

1209
00:56:55,150 --> 00:57:05,619
Yahoo it is this working mightily to get

1210
00:57:01,028 --> 00:57:10,650
your sword out of it it begins to adopt

1211
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:14,259
a series of behaviors that are bizarre

1212
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:17,349
like it's a scenario that that maybe it

1213
00:57:14,259 --> 00:57:20,230
doesn't have a good answer for it parent

1214
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:23,528
grab it interested give it half way and

1215
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:27,490
then it in and that pipe opens it emits

1216
00:57:23,528 --> 00:57:29,318
a blast working workers to work on it

1217
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:32,108
again he's the one hurting the root yeah

1218
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:34,568
busy counsel so and you don't think you

1219
00:57:32,108 --> 00:57:37,239
don't think that it you don't think the

1220
00:57:34,568 --> 00:57:39,909
root is getting any better by the act of

1221
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:41,889
removing the sword you think this you

1222
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:43,690
think of this root you sort of it's like

1223
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:45,730
thinking you're like chewing on a carrot

1224
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:48,429
like you're chewing around to carry and

1225
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:51,068
it's basically like it is it is lacking

1226
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:55,509
like those vital the vital part of this

1227
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:58,058
root have seen better days at this point

1228
00:57:55,509 --> 00:58:00,489
but you can see that the edge around the

1229
00:57:58,059 --> 00:58:04,150
damaged this is that it's like peeled up

1230
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:06,608
in a way like bark um right around the

1231
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,920
edge is it like it like it died around

1232
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,659
the time you don't know about that you

1233
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,940
just think that it's not any type of

1234
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:15,759
root that you know about okay but it's

1235
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:19,059
not like healing and no no you don't say

1236
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:21,369
anything like that okay dummies yeah I

1237
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:24,420
always make a selfie lemonade yes let's

1238
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:27,730
just face it it's a neuron there you go

1239
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,930
uh I need zombie king city the city of

1240
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:31,119
the journey I'm going to you so much RG

1241
00:58:28,929 --> 00:58:36,608
to make the sound of hideous laughter

1242
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:39,579
come out of my illusion oh I hate robot

1243
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:41,558

you I bet you totally can't pull the

1246
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:50,348
sword out and hit the fruit again it was

1247
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:54,329
lame is what why that's like Jesus

1248
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:57,759
Christ like the robot seven solvers yeah

1249
00:58:54,329 --> 00:59:02,019
it is it is now slice another second

1250
00:58:57,759 --> 00:59:03,849
part of the route I yeah yeah it is now

1251
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:05,469
sort of moved its attentions over here I

1252
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:09,039
mean and this time it doesn't get stuck

1253
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:14,709
but it is continuously trying to go at

1254
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:18,550
this immortal ghost yeah

1255
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:20,199
Rosie is very very very quietly laughing

1256
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:22,090
her ass off by the way watching this

1257
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:27,789
this is the this is the most delightful

1258
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:30,400
thing when I are eating popcorn just

00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:32,170
like it's good as it's happening this

1260
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,789

have done mention that route to I was

1262
00:59:33,789 --> 00:59:38,199

00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,090
thank you have you a nicer make him sing

1264
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:42,730
cute that he got an edge of it so he

1265
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:44,860
doesn't live up to past um I think I'm

1266
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:47,440
saying that he's like tug tug all chummy

1267
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:49,599
just it yeah okay so I you want to

1268
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,940

to do that do you want to weld it still

1270
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:57,280
out there you want to do anything with

00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:59,559
velvet to get up there um but he could

1272
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,870
put the thing back on I guess so but I

1273
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:04,210
don't want to cause he could but I don't

1274
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:06,400

01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,840
um yeah I don't have I have anything

1287
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:39,579
else to great at the moment but are you

1288
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,650
saying but you're trying to deliver yeah

1289
01:00:39,579 --> 01:00:43,449

1293
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,390
extent of minor illusion can you still

1294
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,179
manipulate it or have you just said make

1295
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:57,849
a make a dancing cloth and then that's

1296
01:00:55,179 --> 01:00:59,139
the end of it it is the sound image of

1297
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:01,389
an object in range the last of the

1298
01:00:59,139 --> 01:01:03,400
duration if a creature needs action to

1299
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:06,039

lot of looking in books and obviously

1325
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:12,460
that's the best this is this is what you

1326

1370
01:04:24,108 --> 01:04:30,828
scintillating up on that yeah just like

1371
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:35,088
a crouched figure like did you see the

1372
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:37,130
you see VA making it absolutely oh yeah

1373
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:39,588

you see V it's like a nope I love life I

1376
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:50,298
mean look at the young man reform nice

1377
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:51,199
so all of the units of light populated

1378
01:04:50,298 --> 01:04:54,710
Laxman's

1379
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,899
you see the you can hear the furnace

1380
01:04:54,710 --> 01:05:00,528
door creeks open again you see another

1381
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:04,028
emerald blast go over the top when that

1382
01:05:00,528 --> 01:05:07,400
has no effect right you see him

1383
01:05:04,028 --> 01:05:10,759
hunker himself underneath the root and

1384
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:16,490
then try to swipe at it from the back

1385
01:05:10,759 --> 01:05:18,588
okay and when it connects you can see it

1386
01:05:16,489 --> 01:05:22,250
the the part where it's almost like

1387
01:05:18,588 --> 01:05:25,130
where you cut that wedge out of a tree

1388
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:26,809
and then you let it fell basically we

1389
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:30,048
have a lot of damage here and then some

1390
01:05:26,809 --> 01:05:32,240
damage here and then when he swipes he

1391
01:05:30,048 --> 01:05:36,440
clears out the rest of the back of the

1392
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:39,219
root and it sort of dangles there and

1393
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:46,338
then you see it look down at the root

1394
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:49,548
and then try to lift the root back up

1395
01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:51,619
but the vital SAP makes it a challenge

1396
01:05:49,548 --> 01:05:54,469
oh yeah and so it's sort of slipped out

1397
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:57,469
and then it puts itself up underneath it

1398
01:05:54,469 --> 01:06:02,358
and tries to hold it up with its

1399
01:05:57,469 --> 01:06:04,188
shoulder feel so bad now I did all the

1400
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,538
help a brain that's list a little bit

1401
01:06:04,188 --> 01:06:07,159
and then he moves over a little bit like

1402
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:08,900
this and tries to hold it like this and

1403
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:09,679
you think that this might go on for

1404
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,298
quite some time

1405
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,088
what's that SAP look like tell me about

1406
01:06:11,298 --> 01:06:18,228
spinal fluid but the SAP is actually not

1407
01:06:14,088 --> 01:06:24,380
a hundred percent unlike mr. glowing man

1408
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:29,018

01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:46,519
uh like I sensed that that velvet is

1435
01:07:42,588 --> 01:07:48,739
looking at me in whatever ways it's like

1436
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:50,568
it's completely you just impede all the

1437
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:52,699
properties however you feel about

1438
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:54,708
whatever you're doing is how we can

1439
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:56,659
velvet feel we can do it so the genuine

1440
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:57,909
like what I believe is the accurate way

1441
01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:59,108
which is I can't

1442
01:07:57,909 --> 01:08:00,940
actually communicate with it when it's

1443
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:02,798
apart from me right it has no mind for

1444
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,510
me to speak to right so it does come

1445
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:06,099
back having finished its work yeah now

1446
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:08,470
once back I said go back out there and

1447
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:13,660
visible scoop up some neck green goop

1448
01:08:08,469 --> 01:08:14,529
until it's like think that glop in your

1449
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:16,920
belly

1450
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:19,750
yeah come back with a full tummy and yes

1451
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:23,289
before Hawkins oh he's corporeal I

1452
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:27,579
thought that allocation he can do that

1453
01:08:23,289 --> 01:08:28,689
because everything he could bring unlike

1454
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:30,369
if you if you couldn't do it it'd be

1455
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:33,849
like if there was an imaginary friend

1456
01:08:30,369 --> 01:08:35,738
really good job by this one yeah so he

1457
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:38,920
tells you yeah oh yeah you know I was

1458
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:44,198
serving you guys I told you see very

1459
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:45,730
romantic Canadian and Susur chariot was

1460
01:08:44,198 --> 01:08:47,169
I'm sorry get me something that stuff

1461
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:49,000
she doesn't like the anti Canadian

1462
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:50,588
rhetoric and we need a training my

1463
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,829
great-grandmother's Canadian so I can

1464
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:56,500
say whatever I want most for that's true

1465
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:58,960
so you so you so he slips out you can

1466
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:02,198
sort of see slight disturbances in the

1467
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:05,350
dust for strength and then you can see

1468
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:07,528
that this this vital SAP has just begun

1469
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:11,819
to it's flowing freely through this

1470
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:15,370
injury and then this it begun to coat

1471
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:17,319
this mechanical interloper virtually

1472
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:20,048
from head to toe keep it up nothing yet

1473
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:22,900
nothing anyway I mean I really got a

1474
01:09:20,048 --> 01:09:24,909
really good and so engine so you see but

1475
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:29,259
the flow is rich man it's like a tapped

1476
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:32,198
maple and you can see it pooling just in

1477
01:09:29,259 --> 01:09:34,779
space you can see it sort of following

1478
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:37,869
pooling here and then that pool sort of

1479
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:41,799
winds in the way back to the party I

1480
01:09:37,869 --> 01:09:44,798
want to get a little like I have like a

1481
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:46,899
wine but not like a wine skin might have

1482
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:50,319
a wine skin like a water skin can't be

1483
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:52,059
entered on and I dump it out and like

1484
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:55,600
put it out for the unseen server and I'm

1485
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:57,969
like yeah nobody just put in there and I

1486
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,110
see I see I see like a mouth like takes

1487
01:09:57,969 --> 01:10:02,710
I'm out of the thing

1488
01:09:59,109 --> 01:10:04,479
citizen yeah they're like oh I don't

1489
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:06,390
know if I just drop it dick look in

1490
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:10,868
there and I crooked my ticket

1491
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:12,699
absolutely it even it's even inside the

1492
01:10:10,868 --> 01:10:14,859
container there's a stoppered bottle or

1493
01:10:12,698 --> 01:10:18,250
is it a skin the skin okay

1494
01:10:14,859 --> 01:10:19,329
um it doesn't sit still in there oh it's

1495
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:21,130
movin

1496
01:10:19,329 --> 01:10:23,139
yeah it doesn't it doesn't sit still no

1497
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:27,039
interesting um yeah

1498
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:30,609
restless is listener what it man gonna

1499
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:34,779
let it are less bad talk to talk to your

1500
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:37,539
doctor about our Oh SSO huh my doctor

1501
01:10:34,779 --> 01:10:39,460
yes I need some help I need you're fine

1502
01:10:37,539 --> 01:10:42,279
just like sitting on the beach in a

1503
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:46,329
bathtub flus right because Chicago so

1504
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:49,630
you make you make your way back through

1505
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:51,460
the tunnel having satisfied the

1506
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:55,389
objective laid out before you buy the

1507
01:10:51,460 --> 01:11:00,399
older brand and then as you as you get

1508
01:10:55,389 --> 01:11:03,069
back your little pop hop friend beat you

1509
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:05,618
to the edge it looks down and chitters

1510
01:11:03,069 --> 01:11:10,238
and then you see this staircase form

1511
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:13,089
itself back up to your level and you can

1512
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:15,399
then take that down through the through

1513
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:17,949
the hole the tour going back to see the

1514
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:19,809
brain going back to Bobby so Bobby the

1515
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:22,178
brain my question is though before we

1516
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:22,840
left we I mean we had a look at this

1517
01:11:22,179 --> 01:11:24,789
thing

1518
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:27,069
do we have reason to row Boyd yeah the

1519
01:11:24,789 --> 01:11:28,840
robot do we have reason to think that my

1520
01:11:27,069 --> 01:11:32,559
life isn't is it the same metal and

1521
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:35,260
stone constructs no are we waiting - you

1522
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,440
didn't sense anything that was unified

1523
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:42,340
about that okay I would addict are we

1524
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:44,319
able to what might help us determine its

1525
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,880
origin like every single thing built

1526
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:46,948
like that before I be heard of something

1527
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,210
like that before

1528
01:11:46,948 --> 01:11:53,799
well you've you've heard of different

1529
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:55,960
types of automata okay um golems of

1530
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,520
various kinds but you you haven't heard

1531
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,560
of something like like this in

1532
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:02,469
particular okay I just want to see if

1533
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,389
there was any like we see if there's

1534
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:07,739
more of these we have just keep in mind

1535
01:12:04,389 --> 01:12:11,139
if you ever if for whatever reason

1536
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:13,448
during this adventure even now you might

1537
01:12:11,139 --> 01:12:16,179
see another one very soon okay I don't

1538
01:12:13,448 --> 01:12:16,598
know clearly spend more time you're

1539
01:12:16,179 --> 01:12:17,859
welcome

1540
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:21,460
each time you're going to go we're gonna

1541
01:12:17,859 --> 01:12:24,339
sell the out of this - robe lights

1542
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:28,810
so I guess this would be for ruling yeah

1543
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:30,340
I went down to Justin yeah Cervantes

1544
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:31,719
Reina all right now let's go to the

1545
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:33,520
brain because we're gonna I wanna make

1546
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:35,158
sure you we did it we're supposed to do

1547
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,369
I want to do you feel better there

1548
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:39,658
friend

1549
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:45,698
yeah yeah exactly so you can you can see

1550
01:12:39,658 --> 01:12:49,000
that down from this from that direction

1551
01:12:45,698 --> 01:12:53,379
much as you would see ur eyes you can

1552
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,340
see the root itself withering this is

1553
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:58,719
not a natural level of decomposition

1554
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:02,260
this isn't this is not how it works it

1555
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:04,448
takes a little while but you can see

1556
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:06,400
that it's almost shuddering with its

1557
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:09,158
collapse

1558
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:11,198
and you can see it shrinking in the

1559
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:13,779
wound of the brain and because you

1560
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:18,519
there's still there's still a

1561
01:13:13,779 --> 01:13:21,460
substantial cavity yeah inside the elder

1562
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:23,520
brain but it doesn't express pain or

1563
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:26,230
discomfort or anything like that

1564
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:30,489
alright asking about how asking about

1565
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:34,468
the GU gonna hold up the bag I don't say

1566
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:38,468
Brian what's in this Brian

1567
01:13:34,469 --> 01:13:45,750
sorry Bobby I misspoke um elder Brian

1568
01:13:38,469 --> 01:13:50,020
elder Brian yeah brain actually yeah I

1569
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:52,000
say this was flowing through the roots

1570
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:56,080
that keep you bound here yes we're

1571
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:59,050
talking to this um what would it be what

1572
01:13:56,079 --> 01:14:01,658
do you make it if shows him sure you'd

1573
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:04,210
know more than I would and then I look

1574
01:14:01,658 --> 01:14:12,848
at it and then possibly roller survival

1575
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:15,069
check yeah say how would that be figured

1576
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:15,400
out amigo many forests do they have down

1577
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:18,460
there

1578
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:22,779
I don't know 30 I can't map what's that

1579
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:25,539
parsecs yeah 13 it's still I mean it's

1580
01:14:22,779 --> 01:14:29,319
even inside the skin it's still full of

1581
01:14:25,539 --> 01:14:32,439
potentials and action okay

1582
01:14:29,319 --> 01:14:35,079
may I have a bright future yeah keep

1583
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:36,219
going got away ideas warming in suburban

1584
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:37,429
and it's a part of an after-school

1585
01:14:36,219 --> 01:14:41,060
program for

1586
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:43,190
fluid great um and it submitted its

1587
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:46,219
delivering results that's clearly I

1588
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:48,769
quark it and then I queued back I also

1589
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:51,890
make sure not to put it in the bag next

1590
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:53,659
to the snake very concerned so what if

1591
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:55,520
you tell that would be you don't want to

1592
01:14:53,658 --> 01:14:57,109
get James the Giant Peach scenario yeah

1593
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,760
we end up with a bunch of like normal

1594
01:14:57,109 --> 01:14:59,359
ass bugs but now these bugs are

1595
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,610
to you actually

1596
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:04,099
do you want attention actually you know

1597
01:15:01,609 --> 01:15:07,460
what yeah I miss better than area yeah

1598
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:09,890
so great ask him any time if you feeling

1599
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:14,649
better I mean noticeable difference yet

1600
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:18,520
as well as can be expected I expect that

1601
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:22,339
the process of healing from this

1602
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:23,179
inconvenience to take a hundred to two

1603
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,429
hundred years

1604
01:15:23,179 --> 01:15:26,989
sounds good kind of anyway get a little

1605
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:28,609
better right out the gates and us some

1606
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:29,718
be able to annihilate you had a little

1607
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:32,119
stronger so I can help us something

1608
01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:36,739
that's it you could like Triangulum yeah

1609
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:42,559
give a little kiss like an actual uh on

1610
01:15:36,738 --> 01:15:45,609
that whole healthy yeah I get there uh I

1611
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,409
appreciate the gesture I don't think it

1612
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:50,779
would you appreciate somebody walking

1613
01:15:48,408 --> 01:15:52,908
inside of you to heal you I think it's

1614
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:55,130
understanding I mean like lately John

1615
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:57,408
little brain or out here let's go inside

1616
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:59,090
and I get 100 annoyed you have yeah I

1617
01:15:57,408 --> 01:16:01,960
mean like used in my head one for names

1618
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:04,789
in that's what I imagine the multi-angle

1619
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:07,850
probably I'm gonna be a weirdo about it

1620
01:16:04,789 --> 01:16:10,279
how do you feel something uh why don't

1621
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:12,320
you ask if you would like it yeah it

1622
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:13,729
would like it I go up like this and go

1623
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:18,049
give me a touch you know a little touchy

1624
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:21,319
little touch you see you see a shudder

1625
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:26,360
just sort of kind of good the gelatinous

1626
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:28,759
surface of the Beltre bad yeah he's good

1627
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:31,819
he's very good not ask me about my Bush

1628
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,199
so like I got something to get lost in

1629
01:16:31,819 --> 01:16:36,439
translation this will make you feel good

1630
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:38,750
and I go like this I can touch you until

1631
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:39,428
it's I could touch you until if you feel

1632
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,800
good

1633
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:44,719
wraps begin to congregate in front of

1634
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,090
you between you and the brain began to

1635
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:49,859
form themselves into sort of Gears of

1636
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:52,289
War style half wall and

1637
01:16:49,859 --> 01:16:54,389
I think you likes it maybe a massage

1638
01:16:52,289 --> 01:16:56,519
table couple off I go find your lost

1639
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:59,070

magical in the club well then I didn't

1646
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:16,020
need to hold one thing you can assess it

1647
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:20,159
you know I mean it'd be like maybe like

1648
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:22,860
assessing um you know ascetic wisdom

1649
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,609
from a anthropological perspective right

1650
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:24,809
yeah

1651
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:26,579
I just want to see if I can little

1652
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:27,990
vibration up yeah what was it what's

1653
01:17:26,579 --> 01:17:30,239
that oh it's it's seven seventeen

1654
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:33,090
seventeen yeah this is this is a

1655
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:36,420
profound fluid I mean do you think you

1656
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:40,829
think just with your basic assessment

1657
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:43,140
your basic conception of it I mean it

1658
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:48,119
could be a potion it could be a healing

1659
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:50,630
potion straight uh-huh nice I won't try

1660
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:53,159
it but that's nice to know she had a bug

1661
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:54,539
shaft come up to Gundam the other the

1662
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:57,329
big old robot up there defending that

1663
01:17:54,539 --> 01:18:00,090
thing ya know anything about that

1664
01:17:57,329 --> 01:18:00,439
Bobby in case we encounter another one

1665
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:04,020
of these

1666
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:07,859
automata can you give us any advice on

1667
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:09,330
how to defeat them I that's the only

1668
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:12,179
automata that I know of

1669
01:18:09,329 --> 01:18:13,769
okay the iron golem right seems like it

1670
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:16,230
yeah it's the only one that I know in

1671
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:23,970
Chinese found I feel like you will you

1672
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:25,979
will meet other presences yeah what can

1673
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:29,940
you tell us about where we're going no

1674
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:33,029
maybe a little prep info oh there's like

1675
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:35,609
a there's like a noticeable pause he

1676
01:18:33,029 --> 01:18:38,189
hadn't considered it I could see yeah

1677
01:18:35,609 --> 01:18:40,589
it's like you think it's like um like

1678
01:18:38,189 --> 01:18:43,409
imagine if you had gears on your brain

1679
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:45,779
like a ten-speed bike and so he doesn't

1680
01:18:43,409 --> 01:18:48,149
he can't tell quite which of those gears

1681
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:51,149
is the appropriate one yeah he doesn't

1682
01:18:48,149 --> 01:18:53,699
know which knowledge is universal and

1683
01:18:51,149 --> 01:18:55,529
which knowledge is local of course but

1684
01:18:53,699 --> 01:18:58,149
we point on the iron golem what ready

1685
01:18:55,529 --> 01:19:02,789
yeah which was a glowing

1686
01:18:58,149 --> 01:19:02,789
they are Kannan he says there are

1687
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:13,269
counters obviously the master of this

1688
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:18,369
city doesn't would prefer that these

1689
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:21,040
routes exist their countermeasures on

1690
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:26,939
all of the greatest trunks I require

1691
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:26,939
only these three right you will meet a

1692
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:42,580
distraught Minotaur let's try okay and

1693
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:50,650
another creature from our own home meat

1694
01:19:42,579 --> 01:19:52,769
boy gross got them nice I I don't know

1695
01:19:50,649 --> 01:19:56,710
if it's even capable of taking offence

1696
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:59,350
but I try I do my god damn dude hey dumb

1697
01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:04,569
brain nice we're getting stuck in a tree

1698
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:07,810
I say I say a Wow like a happy

1699
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:09,969
underground yeah yeah Wow good job yes

1700
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:10,990
another great tree we've got idiot yeah

1701
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:12,940
I said that

1702
01:20:10,989 --> 01:20:16,840
do is not have some a growth for you

1703
01:20:12,939 --> 01:20:23,339
three times in the toilet so but I do

1704
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:25,659
ask is what AK what I do ask is um

1705
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:28,239
question why didn't you need our help

1706
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:30,699
you have these minions could you not

1707
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:34,359
have sent these these rats up to do this

1708
01:20:30,699 --> 01:20:35,889
work brass oh you know just just feel

1709
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:39,339
what you need from the city above and

1710
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:41,590
dissolve or saw through the rest would

1711
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:43,420
never been able to manage the iron golem

1712
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:45,220
and they wouldn't have been able to

1713
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:48,279
manage the route even if they had their

1714
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:50,860
in my ordinary capacity these would be

1715
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:52,960
trivial matters okay and then realize

1716
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:58,839
how bad of a shape use I would entertain

1717
01:20:52,960 --> 01:21:02,980
a scenario by which I leveraged chrono

1718
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:07,539
Mansi perhaps the more in my ordinary

1719
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:11,589
state this is embarrassing

1720
01:21:07,539 --> 01:21:14,529
I apologize it's gotta move

1721
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:16,420
up there yeah this doesn't usually

1722
01:21:14,529 --> 01:21:19,359
happen what's the easiest way to break

1723
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:24,460
these routes each of the routes has a

1724
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:26,079
distinct methodology what are the

1725
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:28,569
methodologies of the remaining two but

1726
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:31,539
this thing's not prima guys like yeah

1727
01:21:28,569 --> 01:21:34,000
like yeah exactly leave a little mystery

1728
01:21:31,539 --> 01:21:35,800
why don't I and hey I'm all about

1729
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,810
efficiency

1730
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:43,929
what button do I match the other the

1731
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:46,869
other routes have no iron sheath okay

1732
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:49,270
that's good no like that

1733
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:52,089
alright let's go to the next one yeah

1734
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:53,020
I'm ready make sure this guy's full

1735
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:59,279
strength yeah

1736
01:21:53,020 --> 01:22:07,090
mr. pop hop uh skitters out of his oh

1737
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:11,229
yeah it's like I'm yeah and then where

1738
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:14,319
he where he comes to rest is sort of

1739
01:22:11,229 --> 01:22:18,069
like the seed crystal upon which another

1740
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:24,130
staircase is built into another cavern

1741
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:26,109
that peels off into the right oh let's

1742
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:28,359
do it and then I realized that

1743
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:30,939
everything must be in a bad way because

1744
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:33,009
he could easily provided us with a rope

1745
01:22:30,939 --> 01:22:35,109
of rats that were like a rung we just

1746
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:38,230
hold on and it pulls us back so we have

1747
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:39,759
to climb stair a rack or yeah oh yeah

1748
01:22:38,229 --> 01:22:41,500
now they may be a mystery is all gone

1749
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,869
for you you're like no way they make a

1750
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:46,270
lazy boy of rats then I just kind of sit

1751
01:22:43,868 --> 01:22:48,519
in and just take me ready to go no it's

1752
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:52,199
look like a clawfoot tub yeah yeah boom

1753
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:56,500
boom like a mini clawfoot tub exactly so

1754
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:59,579
you make your way up this spiral rat

1755
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:02,770
staircase incredibly tasteful in a way

1756
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:04,569
you can that are done railing do you do

1757
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:06,869
yeah it's just like but some of the

1758
01:23:04,569 --> 01:23:10,539
ratchet is posing just like oh yeah

1759
01:23:06,868 --> 01:23:16,569
right around the edge you make your way

1760
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:20,969
up into this next corridor and you feel

1761
01:23:16,569 --> 01:23:23,399
cold breath of wind the breath of wind

1762
01:23:20,969 --> 01:23:27,659
that tells us

1763
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:31,349
that a commercial break is upon us by

1764
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:32,639
which I mean a restroom break don't go

1765
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:33,120
anywhere unless you have to go to the

1766
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,300
bathroom

1767
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:38,189
in which case do that and then come back

1768
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:39,890
and then we'll finish just ground to the

1769
01:23:38,189 --> 01:23:43,859
seating

1770
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:46,650
hello i'm jennifer cail our camps when

1771
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:51,359
last we saw our heroes they had emerged

1772
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:54,960
up a rat staircase into another tunnel

1773
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:57,359
toward the second of three routes that

1774
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,359
they need to destroy for an elder brain

1775
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:01,439
it's a complicated story but but that's

1776
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:06,389
that's where we left our here Taylor

1777
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:09,359
hose is one of the seven Greek classics

1778
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:14,490
a point yeah they're subtle yeah all

1779
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:15,929
right about that yes okay so we are yeah

1780
01:24:14,489 --> 01:24:17,789
we're on our way now through the

1781
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:21,780
corridor it is to determine the second

1782
01:24:17,789 --> 01:24:26,519
humid day and it is yeah this is the

1783
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:30,090
other one had a very natural bent it was

1784
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:33,330
very very you know circular almost like

1785
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:36,860
a direct human oh they went out very

1786
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:40,260
efficient this is the all right angles

1787
01:24:36,859 --> 01:24:43,259

01:32:46,849 --> 01:32:52,130
times yep like it is as much of a

1966
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:54,559
recurring gag I have on this share back

1967
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:56,389

1968
01:32:54,559 --> 01:32:56,570

okay so walnuts in there and we're all

1971
01:32:58,998 --> 01:33:04,849

yeah is go free

1973
01:33:04,849 --> 01:33:08,150
but also I know the kisses can see

1974
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:09,739
through the guy decision so I'm feeling

1975
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:12,288
like a little like in the weasel for

1976
01:33:09,738 --> 01:33:15,888
most waited like the little weasel

1977
01:33:12,288 --> 01:33:18,948
dances but that's it right no this thing

1978
01:33:15,889 --> 01:33:23,230
is just lifting ahead and by you staying

1979
01:33:18,948 --> 01:33:25,399
with me used to be panic come on yeah

1980
01:33:23,229 --> 01:33:27,259
but it's like only only cuz there's no

1981
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:28,339
feels like a tiny tiny goofy side so

1982
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:32,210
it's what you're trying to dish up I

1983
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:34,219
want to first let's try and smell and

1984
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:38,779
see if I can smell where that fresh air

1985
01:33:34,219 --> 01:33:40,760
is coming from Oh big money no I had

1986
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:44,389
advantage on those rolls alright good

1987
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:51,219
job okay ah and so then that would be a

1988
01:33:44,389 --> 01:33:51,219
plus phone so 17 yeah this is breath

1989
01:33:52,538 --> 01:33:58,309
okay and so I said that and I go what I

1990
01:33:56,029 --> 01:34:01,429
thought was fresh air is actually fresh

1991
01:33:58,309 --> 01:34:04,449
breath sorry I was like oh sorry

1992
01:34:01,429 --> 01:34:07,399
what doesn't sound right who is this

1993
01:34:04,448 --> 01:34:10,219
what I thought was this person it's

1994
01:34:07,399 --> 01:34:13,339
actually fresh breath yeah it's bad

1995
01:34:10,219 --> 01:34:18,309
enough smell aside my Sultana I feel

1996
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:23,420
comfortable together no one else can I

1997
01:34:18,309 --> 01:34:24,619
say it smell that nothing I what's funny

1998
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:26,430
is that I can only go through the

1999
01:34:24,618 --> 01:34:30,359
whistle with the hat

2000
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:34,110
oh yeah this is this is breath it's

2001
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:36,750
cooled substantially by the stone that

2002
01:34:34,109 --> 01:34:39,000
all that it's all filtering through but

2003
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:41,819
this is this is definitely breath can I

2004
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:48,899
spank outwork come from oh really

2005
01:34:41,819 --> 01:34:51,420
okay okay go which way uh it is directly

2006
01:34:48,899 --> 01:34:53,699
forward and to the right

2007
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:56,850
okay like through that Eastern passage

2008
01:34:53,699 --> 01:35:00,989
indeed okay so Eastern passage I don't

2009
01:34:56,850 --> 01:35:04,560
know um it was a check check at urban

2010
01:35:00,989 --> 01:35:08,250
dictionary I like it like a D and I give

2011
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,720
a little the nose swizzle over that way

2012
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:11,970
I was checking to see whether or not a

2013
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:13,460
native poisonous snake gets anything

2014
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:15,600
good but he ain't good

2015
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:16,770
there's a couple of there are some bull

2016
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:20,310
and there's a couple reasons that this

2017
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:21,930
is the best campaign of all time one of

2018
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:24,360
them is that you guys still have your

2019
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:26,460
fingers in your head yeah you know yeah

2020
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:30,089
yeah we've been doing this every time no

2021
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:31,980
I love it's our group call yeah if I if

2022
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:34,739
I had had Stan she ate him as a rat then

2023
01:35:31,979 --> 01:35:36,209
he'd have a keen smell okay be but

2024
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:40,319
there's a another great show how he's

2025
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:42,750
jetting up them okay he's a cool tackle

2026
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:45,000
he's rad good grab maybe I like him for

2027
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:51,770
other reasons aesthetically yeah you so

2028
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:56,729
arm brand you please me uh you sweetie

2029
01:35:51,770 --> 01:36:00,740
we're not doing the fleshlight oh no

2030
01:35:56,729 --> 01:36:00,739
more merchandise opportunity

2031
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:09,399
yeah what no checks start coming in okay

2032
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:13,929
all right so yeah I mean was that Darwin

2033
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:17,529
yes are you proceeding Hey yeah I sell

2034
01:36:13,929 --> 01:36:18,969
it yeah and then we come to as you is

2035
01:36:17,529 --> 01:36:23,050
used to basically you hit like the back

2036
01:36:18,969 --> 01:36:26,859
wall and the left you can see goes 20

2037
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:30,309
feet and then as a hard stop and just in

2038
01:36:26,859 --> 01:36:32,380
darkness um and then you can see to the

2039
01:36:30,309 --> 01:36:35,770
right that that basically you're seeing

2040
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:37,989
the back left corner of a room and it's

2041
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:41,110
just a wall between you and that room

2042
01:36:37,988 --> 01:36:43,750
you can go right around the passage yeah

2043
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:45,788
let's let's go not like you know

2044
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:51,179
barreling in but yeah let's go right to

2045
01:36:45,788 --> 01:36:58,750
the crime in Tegel you can see as you

2046
01:36:51,179 --> 01:37:03,639
enter I got to do a roll but as you

2047
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:08,260
enter you can see kneeling in front of

2048
01:37:03,639 --> 01:37:11,260
wha what you assume is is this region's

2049
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:12,909
root structure this one does not cross

2050
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:15,429
the room this actually pierces the

2051
01:37:12,908 --> 01:37:17,589
ceiling and then goes directly down

2052
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:21,520
through the floor almost just like a

2053
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:30,429
column and you can see kneeling in front

2054
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:31,510
of this root is a Minotaur oh that's so

2055
01:37:30,429 --> 01:37:34,210
weird you say

2056
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:36,099
the Minotaur is how how much what

2057
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:37,448
information do you want you should get

2058
01:37:36,099 --> 01:37:40,360
that information from your friends are

2059
01:37:37,448 --> 01:37:43,839
weird yeah we have started with yeah I

2060
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:45,460
want to do a little it connects to a

2061
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:49,750
perception on them to see what his

2062
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:52,689
situation is an emotional based on smell

2063
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:56,500
number just based on my eyeballs our

2064
01:37:52,689 --> 01:37:59,138
wine is to let smells upset that's real

2065
01:37:56,500 --> 01:38:01,029
real good 22 and I can tell it's because

2066
01:37:59,139 --> 01:38:03,069
of his IDs mm-hm

2067
01:38:01,029 --> 01:38:05,288
ask your doctor you don't need a

2068
01:38:03,069 --> 01:38:07,210
perception yeah yeah I like I like an

2069
01:38:05,288 --> 01:38:10,420
insight I'm gonna use it is the insight

2070
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:13,689
as well I do have insight alright I'm

2071
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:15,899

2075
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:31,380

you recall the stories of old not no

2264
01:48:01,238 --> 01:48:08,938
how the our Enclave Ward with the

2265
01:48:04,658 --> 01:48:12,638
elephant in the Underdark

2266
01:48:08,939 --> 01:48:15,189
well it's like having a moment where

2267
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:17,618
she's like I thought my mother told me

2268
01:48:15,189 --> 01:48:19,179
all the stories like no I got I know I

2269
01:48:17,618 --> 01:48:22,118
thought I knew all the tales and she's

2270
01:48:19,179 --> 01:48:23,378
like no it's been so long since I've

2271
01:48:22,118 --> 01:48:29,018
heard the stories you have to tell me

2272
01:48:23,378 --> 01:48:33,309
just why wouldn't she have told you well

2273
01:48:29,019 --> 01:48:38,349
we I don't I was really breaking there

2274
01:48:33,309 --> 01:48:40,899
you get her to the Nana's here as a he's

2275
01:48:38,349 --> 01:48:43,119
trying to build it he's trying to do

2276
01:48:40,899 --> 01:48:49,660
some kind of translation as I'm Emma's

2277
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:55,359
ear is a war root seizure

2278
01:48:49,659 --> 01:48:58,849
against the Underdark 300 are our people

2279
01:48:55,359 --> 01:49:04,639
ward with the illicit for a thousand

2280
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:09,010
years and we ward with them from the

2281
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:13,280
surface we could plant our siege engines

2282
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:15,850
beneath the Sun and their roots would

2283
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:20,319
reach down and destroy their cities

2284
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:23,360
pretty cool clearly extremely conflicted

2285
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:29,449
he has a person and also well expected

2286
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:35,829
just this city is a corruption of our

2287
01:49:29,449 --> 01:49:41,319
mystery what a war room grows down and

2288
01:49:35,829 --> 01:49:48,340
gathers stone and moss and water and

2289
01:49:41,319 --> 01:49:50,929
magic and turns it into a weapon he has

2290
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:53,960
transformed into a seed that grows a

2291
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:58,579
city to what end

2292
01:49:53,960 --> 01:50:03,970
I think he would delight him to plant

2293
01:49:58,579 --> 01:50:03,970
cities like this that he could dominate

2294
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:16,190
and the same clauses well I've heard all

2295
01:50:11,569 --> 01:50:18,590
I need to hear for now we're you know

2296
01:50:16,189 --> 01:50:21,219
we're here to deal with it I don't want

2297
01:50:18,590 --> 01:50:23,500
him to get any farther than NEMA's ear I

2298
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:27,170
want there to be more

2299
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:31,939
Nana's ear just you have one task before

2300
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:35,119
you but you need to know that as soon as

2301
01:50:31,939 --> 01:50:38,689
you attempt to harm this root come on

2302
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:41,930
bud I will have no choice but to fight

2303
01:50:38,689 --> 01:50:47,389
you that is to do my then given what is

2304
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:51,920
the quickest way to destroy this root to

2305
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:52,369
destroy me first dang it I can't let you

2306
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:54,230

2317
01:51:29,538 --> 01:51:35,898
way of the shadow monk abilities correct

2318
01:51:33,408 --> 01:51:39,259
in our conception right shadow obviously

2319
01:51:35,899 --> 01:51:41,628
is a place shadow exists you can shape

2320
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:44,359
it you are identifying you are you see

2321
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:46,809
indeed you led your adept in the use of

2322
01:51:44,359 --> 01:51:50,719
shadow but shadow also represents

2323
01:51:46,809 --> 01:51:53,088
philosophically the unappreciated work

2324
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:55,269
and toils of people in the corners of

2325
01:51:53,088 --> 01:52:00,260
society right right right

2326
01:51:55,269 --> 01:52:03,498
grandma Nancy allows you to seize the

2327
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:06,498
use of a target shadow as many targets

2328
01:52:03,498 --> 01:52:09,708
as are available and have their shadows

2329
01:52:06,498 --> 01:52:11,719
stop so may I describe to you what I

2330
01:52:09,708 --> 01:52:18,010
would like to happen here yes

2331
01:52:11,719 --> 01:52:21,019
okay it seems like this Minotaur has a

2332
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:22,878
personal connection with walnut and so I

2333
01:52:21,019 --> 01:52:26,719
don't want to hurt him but what I would

2334
01:52:22,878 --> 01:52:31,038
like to do is call upon the plane the

2335
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:33,048
deme plane of shadow to snake tendrils

2336
01:52:31,038 --> 01:52:38,599
of shadow out of the dark corners of

2337
01:52:33,048 --> 01:52:42,139
this room and twine up his legs around

2338
01:52:38,599 --> 01:52:43,489
to the arms and binds him in place but

2339
01:52:42,139 --> 01:52:46,429
not hurt him I love it you're going to

2340
01:52:43,488 --> 01:52:48,078
need a light source okay I got three one

2341
01:52:46,429 --> 01:52:51,679
yeah I'm your light source yeah shadow

2342
01:52:48,078 --> 01:52:53,058
shadow exists as an opposite okay where

2343
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:56,199
would it help you so you could go to

2344
01:52:53,059 --> 01:52:58,579
most I think probably directly over like

2345
01:52:56,198 --> 01:52:59,898
give me a give me a long shadow on him

2346
01:52:58,578 --> 01:53:02,599
okay big boy

2347
01:52:59,899 --> 01:53:06,350
I might do it a shot yeah and then yeah

2348
01:53:02,599 --> 01:53:09,090
right right three three two right now

2349
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:11,789
meanwhile are like kicking the axe away

2350
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:13,260
from yeah well yeah my idea is like we

2351
01:53:11,789 --> 01:53:14,550
promise when I'm going to destroy the

2352
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:17,190
root but why don't you take an hour

2353
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:20,789
break and just go over there in a while

2354
01:53:17,189 --> 01:53:21,869
Brian's doing it okay so I'm gonna I

2355
01:53:20,789 --> 01:53:24,800
don't know what I'm doing this though

2356
01:53:21,869 --> 01:53:28,920
just goes right yeah like I'm Cyclops

2357
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:33,690
I'm going to do dancing lights okay I'm

2358
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:36,300
gonna do it low and slow right you're

2359
01:53:33,689 --> 01:53:37,379
gonna get a strong shadow okay no no

2360
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:39,900
it's going to be some distance away so

2361
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:43,260
you guys have to find shadows a crisp

2362
01:53:39,899 --> 01:53:48,659
long shadow that will slide off of the

2363
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:51,960
stone of this of this floor and and sort

2364
01:53:48,659 --> 01:53:54,420
of infect the body of this Minotaur a

2365
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:56,220
painless like I said it is not intended

2366
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:59,190
to cause pain but it is caused it is

2367
01:53:56,220 --> 01:54:00,840
going to bind him in place absolutely so

2368
01:53:59,189 --> 01:54:02,339
that he cannot interfere with our tour

2369
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:05,039
so I'm you're going to kill them right

2370
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:06,480
what consumes you seems cool how long

2371
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:07,019
going to be maintained that's a great

2372
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:09,899
question

2373
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:11,670
there Graham I'm antsy yeah it's going

2374
01:54:09,899 --> 01:54:13,649
to last for a couple rounds you should

2375
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:16,829
you should be you're all working it

2376
01:54:13,649 --> 01:54:18,569
should be okay okay okay wisdom yeah

2377
01:54:16,829 --> 01:54:20,399
stop please not wait this stuff can make

2378
01:54:18,569 --> 01:54:24,710
you anything yeah I could do without for

2379
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:28,949
dinner yeah yeah grapples gosh plan oh

2380
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:31,350
yeah alright alright okay we're good so

2381
01:54:28,949 --> 01:54:34,500
you so you create DC shattered yeah kill

2382
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:35,579
is that is that bad yeah everybody if I

2383
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,149
destroy his mind but he's still just

2384
01:54:35,579 --> 01:54:38,010
standing here

2385
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:40,049
yeah he's okay yeah I think dissonant

2386
01:54:38,010 --> 01:54:42,150
whispering all right well my so you you

2387
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:46,140
you create a so the light source yeah

2388
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:47,969
it's uh it's low and in the corner yeah

2389
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:50,039
he's so we're all lit up and he's got a

2390
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:56,420
long shadow cast exactly he has a long

2391
01:54:50,039 --> 01:55:00,180
shadow cast this brilliant or

2392
01:54:56,420 --> 01:55:03,149
casts light up low and vice so there's a

2393
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:04,980
large version of this Minotaur and what

2394
01:55:03,149 --> 01:55:09,269
do you say

2395
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:11,489
I'm really sorry about this you seem

2396
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:12,840
awesome and it seems like you two have a

2397
01:55:11,489 --> 01:55:14,849
lot of catching up to do but we really

2398
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:18,449
can't let you interfere in what we're

2399
01:55:14,850 --> 01:55:19,739
doing today right he reaches down for

2400
01:55:18,449 --> 01:55:25,139
his axe

2401
01:55:19,738 --> 01:55:29,189
and as he does you can see it's his own

2402
01:55:25,139 --> 01:55:34,520
shadow a larger even than he is reaching

2403
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:37,619
down so now shadow is gripped and

2404
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:40,409
wrapped around arms and almost like a

2405
01:55:37,619 --> 01:55:42,569
vine and if the arms are held up the

2406
01:55:40,408 --> 01:55:45,569
legs are held out you can see that the

2407
01:55:42,569 --> 01:55:47,969
axe itself is sort of been spun and

2408
01:55:45,569 --> 01:55:49,259
flung into a corner and clatters away

2409
01:55:47,969 --> 01:55:49,710
and you have a round let's see what you

2410
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:52,980
can do

2411
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:54,869
I want to grab his axe gas-x

2412
01:55:52,979 --> 01:55:56,638
well first I want to go goose him yeah

2413
01:55:54,869 --> 01:55:58,738
and then grab the axe all right only

2414
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,900
event is important running life is ax

2415
01:55:58,738 --> 01:56:04,559
even with miss hearts in it I'm going to

2416
01:56:00,899 --> 01:56:07,170
use his ax ax ax not going to get to

2417
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:08,550
fish out mmm he can't I want to leave it

2418
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:12,060

2419
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:14,909
you get it for me oh wow boom it doesn't

2420
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:16,199
real dinar move oh yeah yeah say so so

2421
01:56:14,908 --> 01:56:18,509
let's see let's let's get initiative so

2422
01:56:16,198 --> 01:56:21,388
we can manage it I'm going to do it

2423
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:32,579
laughs fair one Henchard okay

2424

work on your out have a movie there

2430
01:56:52,619 --> 01:56:58,559
thank you uh what it is before we get in

2431
01:56:57,149 --> 01:57:00,689
there what is the nature of this route

2432
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:02,850
like how does it look to the differ from

2433
01:57:00,689 --> 01:57:05,039
the other one yes this almost looks like

2434
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:08,699
a this just this almost looks like a

2435
01:57:05,039 --> 01:57:10,560
massive vegetable okay so this is I'm

2436
01:57:08,698 --> 01:57:12,178
not it doesn't it doesn't have that that

2437
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,639
sheep hey all right

2438
01:57:12,179 --> 01:57:16,170
the walnut can do a bite probably yeah

2439
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:18,800
that's my last well truth

2440
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:23,429
oh and is it and how big around is it

2441
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:25,739
the trunk of this is probably four feet

2442
01:57:23,429 --> 01:57:27,600
around also pretty not the same of the

2443
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:30,859
oh no no it's a different light all

2444
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:30,860
right wait a second

2445
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:35,130
I dunno what I wanted to do all right

2446
01:57:33,539 --> 01:57:37,738
you could do it I haven't been decided

2447
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:39,569
on our yammering and then you just push

2448
01:57:37,738 --> 01:57:42,539
me all right I want to know well I'm

2449
01:57:39,569 --> 01:57:46,259
gonna die I'm sorry Tex like we're doing

2450
01:57:42,539 --> 01:57:49,710
this real I'm going to use my mind in

2451
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:53,420
hate and my enhance ability on a dinar

2452
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:56,279
oh and then I'm going to give him the

2453
01:57:53,420 --> 01:58:00,179
give him full strength

2454
01:57:56,279 --> 01:58:03,840
wait so judges so you get a advantage on

2455
01:58:00,179 --> 01:58:07,199
any strengths chick right so that would

2456
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:09,179
help I guess you guys feel good okay

2457
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:10,439
right yeah that's what I got going to be

2458
01:58:09,179 --> 01:58:12,630
doing a strength check when I swing on

2459
01:58:10,439 --> 01:58:14,460
that thing well there's another way you

2460
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:16,380
can get I mean it respects resonance

2461
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:19,050
active already should be a normal attack

2462
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:21,090
role I don't know sure sure the scenario

2463
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:24,029
I would say there is that the best-case

2464
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:27,270
scenario is probably like athletics I

2465
01:58:24,029 --> 01:58:30,569
would think that using axe to chop a

2466
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:32,400
thick trunk is in that continuum I'm a

2467
01:58:30,569 --> 01:58:32,639
great weapon master by those I'm talking

2468
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:35,069
about

2469
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:36,690
Aquarion capacity has now doubled we all

2470
01:58:35,069 --> 01:58:40,649
like everyone up in my shoulders and I

2471
01:58:36,689 --> 01:58:43,259
say we around the Maypole there's nobody

2472
01:58:40,649 --> 01:58:45,539
to do would you permit me to use shatter

2473
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:50,420
or is that something that's for

2474
01:58:45,539 --> 01:58:52,710
creatures only no it's for creature self

2475
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:54,809
because it has to make this target as a

2476
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:57,029
creature as a creature that's America

2477
01:58:54,809 --> 01:59:01,800
today we grow yeah it's getting bigger

2478
01:58:57,029 --> 01:59:04,259
you look at it yeah let's see yeah see a

2479
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:05,880
lot of the stuff I get is creature so

2480
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:09,059
it's like I'm not going to hex a root

2481
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:11,639
it's not a creature it could be a little

2482
01:59:09,059 --> 01:59:13,050
even non-match mind a non-magical object

2483
01:59:11,639 --> 01:59:14,789
that isn't being worn or carried also

2484
01:59:13,050 --> 01:59:16,500
takes damages in this those areas no I

2485
01:59:14,789 --> 01:59:17,969
think that Network I think that those

2486
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:19,618
are the rules for creatures in terms of

2487
01:59:17,969 --> 01:59:21,539
like can they saving from damage and

2488
01:59:19,618 --> 01:59:23,189
things like that but I think that I

2489
01:59:21,539 --> 01:59:25,679
think that in general the shattering

2490
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:27,448
force of this is bad right well I'm just

2491
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:29,219

cracking crab leg like yeah exactly yeah

2646
02:06:53,329 --> 02:06:59,199
it's just twisting it and prying it open

2647
02:06:55,510 --> 02:07:02,900
and that that the damage rolled is

2648
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:05,420
sufficient to absolutely sever this root

2649
02:07:02,899 --> 02:07:08,509

I had a nectarine in my lunch when I was

2653
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:19,849
in junior high and I'm very excited

2654
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:22,940
about them because they're great and I

2655
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:26,329
opened it and the seed was full of

2656
02:07:22,939 --> 02:07:27,919
earwigs like I opened it and so whenever

2657
02:07:26,329 --> 02:07:29,689
I eat one now I'm always afraid what

2658
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:31,909
it's going to be like that yeah now

2659
02:07:29,689 --> 02:07:33,619
you're not all scared of it now they

2660
02:07:31,909 --> 02:07:36,979
give them another chance never like

2661
02:07:33,619 --> 02:07:39,250
we're getting so many up all the

2662
02:07:36,979 --> 02:07:42,469
way through like there is nothing but

2663
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:44,829
these worms and then down through the

2664
02:07:42,470 --> 02:07:49,369
rest there's nothing but worms just

2665
02:07:44,829 --> 02:07:52,750
boring it out from top to bottom and at

2666
02:07:49,369 --> 02:07:57,729
the moment that it splits the Minotaur

2667
02:07:52,750 --> 02:08:01,550

nearly in the spaceship and they bring

2802
02:14:01,039 --> 02:14:04,279
out the face and they keep missing the

2803
02:14:02,689 --> 02:14:06,199
space like that's what I'm picturing yes

2804
02:14:04,279 --> 02:14:08,929
that I can't that's good okay perfect

2805
02:14:06,199 --> 02:14:11,869

2806
02:14:08,930 --> 02:14:13,130

02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:22,460
yeah yes yeah that's it um actually

2811
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,319
moistening is vital I know but it is

2812
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:26,449
pulled up and suspended out ordinarily

2813
02:14:24,319 --> 02:14:28,399
there's a you know you can even see the

2814
02:14:26,449 --> 02:14:32,000
remnants of the pool rather be the

2815
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:36,289
ordinary domicile of this sort of entity

2816
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:38,449
okay and kind of negate I think exactly

2817
02:14:36,289 --> 02:14:40,750
it sort of it is again like a like a

2818
02:14:38,449 --> 02:14:46,309

model it's just they're just sort of

2828
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:13,430
moving around each other

2829

another group goes over

2830
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:19,300
and in the southern part of the room

2831
02:15:15,579 --> 02:15:23,619
manifests itself up into a new staircase

2832
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:27,470

02:15:47,750 --> 02:15:49,789
nothing I'm just laying down is very

2844
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:52,699
real

2845
02:15:49,789 --> 02:15:58,250
building so I'm dying to get returned

2846
02:15:52,699 --> 02:16:03,380
real life is finally ha these are very

2847
02:15:58,250 --> 02:16:09,409
small passages that allow only a single

2848
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:16,819
person at a time through them it's ok

2849
02:16:09,409 --> 02:16:20,840
don't like it now and as you wind slowly

2850
02:16:16,819 --> 02:16:22,369
around you can see that it opens up into

2851
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:23,529
a small room sort of like a

2852
02:16:22,369 --> 02:16:26,029
kidney-shaped

2853
02:16:23,529 --> 02:16:30,139
room and you can see that this path

2854
02:16:26,029 --> 02:16:33,579
continues on into darkness but these

2855
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:39,399
areas are actually relatively well lit

2856
02:16:33,579 --> 02:16:46,219
by mushrooms of varying colors nice mmm

2857
02:16:39,399 --> 02:16:50,090
and in this place you can see there is a

2858
02:16:46,219 --> 02:16:53,829
sort of like a stream of sewage you're

2859
02:16:50,090 --> 02:16:59,120
almost certain and you can see several

2860
02:16:53,829 --> 02:17:03,709
shapes perfectly still just with their

2861
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:06,920
feet planted in that sort of trickling

2862
02:17:03,709 --> 02:17:12,169
river and they are standing completely

2863
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:15,319
Stockstill so from head to toe up near

2864
02:17:12,170 --> 02:17:19,280
the top and see a traditional like a

2865
02:17:15,319 --> 02:17:22,430
mushroom cap the rest of the body is

2866
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:25,400
like a is stalks of various kinds so

2867
02:17:22,430 --> 02:17:27,590
imagine stove pipes that come off and go

2868
02:17:25,399 --> 02:17:30,319
up to other

2869
02:17:27,590 --> 02:17:38,299
caps of mushrooms around but they have

2870
02:17:30,319 --> 02:17:41,019
something like a bipedal form and these

2871
02:17:38,299 --> 02:17:43,939
are definitely bipedal mushroom people

2872
02:17:41,019 --> 02:17:45,739
like that one Japanese movie how in

2873
02:17:43,940 --> 02:17:47,059
Japanese monster movies in 60s really is

2874
02:17:45,739 --> 02:17:49,909
like an island of mushroom people

2875
02:17:47,058 --> 02:17:52,489
mushroom people like my favorite piece

2876
02:17:49,909 --> 02:17:54,349
Oak Island yes yeah that's it that's it

2877
02:17:52,489 --> 02:17:56,808
for me to see any evidence of the trunk

2878
02:17:54,349 --> 02:17:59,120
in here not in this not in this

2879
02:17:56,808 --> 02:18:02,268
particular room okay this this appears

2880
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:04,729
to be just how they get down here

2881
02:18:02,269 --> 02:18:07,179
alright and as I say they're almost

2882
02:18:04,728 --> 02:18:11,529
completely still they don't they don't

2883
02:18:07,179 --> 02:18:15,379
respirate and classic since they are

2884
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:16,790
napping or feeding or some what that's

2885
02:18:15,379 --> 02:18:20,839
poor density what's going on under the

2886
02:18:16,790 --> 02:18:24,139
hood yeah there's you can work there you

2887
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:28,429
can eat in the in the light of the

2888
02:18:24,138 --> 02:18:33,199
cavern you can absolutely see that the

2889
02:18:28,429 --> 02:18:36,349
air is adulterated here I spores

2890
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:39,920
do I like it is that something that or

2891
02:18:36,349 --> 02:18:41,889
am I so dryer yeah yeah I mean there's

2892
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:46,519
not a lot of cohabitation between

2893
02:18:41,888 --> 02:18:47,058
strands and my candids but um what are

2894
02:18:46,519 --> 02:18:49,819
they called

2895
02:18:47,058 --> 02:18:51,468
like in it yeah you don't hate it you

2896
02:18:49,819 --> 02:18:54,349
don't hate it it's definitely like its

2897
02:18:51,468 --> 02:18:55,968
home adjacent Yeah right if I got in

if we don't see the trunk yet yeah I

2913
02:19:28,579 --> 02:19:32,510

2914
02:19:30,679 --> 02:19:34,040

2929
02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:21,530
pull around this corner you can see that

2930
02:20:19,129 --> 02:20:26,358
that that sort of river trickles off in

2931
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:30,979
one direction you hang a right down into

2932
02:20:26,359 --> 02:20:37,550
a more people area there's a much larger

2933
02:20:30,978 --> 02:20:41,959
cavern here and in this in this context

2934
02:20:37,549 --> 02:20:44,779
the mica dens are not stock still and

2935
02:20:41,959 --> 02:20:49,728
there and they do not have their feet up

2936
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:52,609
to the you know ankle in sewage trying

2937
02:20:49,728 --> 02:20:56,179
to derive minerals they are actively

2938
02:20:52,609 --> 02:20:58,609
moving about from place to place and so

2939
02:20:56,180 --> 02:21:01,670
to vary degrees you are trying to be

2940
02:20:58,609 --> 02:21:03,530
sneaky but there is something about this

2941
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:06,850
there's something about their home and

2942
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:11,780
something about where they live that

2943
02:21:06,850 --> 02:21:14,479
makes your position clear okay that it's

2944
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:16,880
there none but they don't care we're

2945
02:21:14,478 --> 02:21:19,849
just placing my us force and I know a

2946
02:21:16,879 --> 02:21:21,500
placement exactly like you'd like they

2947
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:23,329
don't have any beefs at all

2948
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:25,909
okay don't think they don't they're not

2949
02:21:23,329 --> 02:21:29,059
they're not angry in any way so good

2950
02:21:25,909 --> 02:21:30,770
well mushroom a walk job no no no

2951
02:21:29,059 --> 02:21:33,170
exactly a you see me you don't know if

2952
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:34,790
it's something like a family group we do

2953
02:21:33,170 --> 02:21:36,799
you don't know how it functions you

2954
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:42,530
don't know how it operates here but you

2955
02:21:36,799 --> 02:21:47,750
see groups of these creatures actively

2956
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:51,710
shaping their environment navigating

2957
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:53,899
navigating space making for things or

2958
02:21:51,709 --> 02:21:57,079
they don't yet this is this day

2959
02:21:53,899 --> 02:22:00,681
live here okay um and you see you kill

2960
02:21:57,079 --> 02:22:05,601
all that a that is for the society so

2961
02:22:00,681 --> 02:22:08,870
there is a as you're sort of passing

2962
02:22:05,601 --> 02:22:11,329
through this this mystical chamber off

2963
02:22:08,870 --> 02:22:14,511
to the left you can see a group it's

2964
02:22:11,329 --> 02:22:18,431
very they're very tightly packed in this

2965
02:22:14,511 --> 02:22:22,069
room I mean almost almost body to body

2966
02:22:18,431 --> 02:22:26,390
and you can hear them all sort of just

2967
02:22:22,069 --> 02:22:30,079
like humming like their home tree yeah

2968
02:22:26,390 --> 02:22:32,239
just like waving around don't have a

2969
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:33,709
congregated around the trunk uh you

2970
02:22:32,239 --> 02:22:35,360
don't know I did that's dude that just

2971
02:22:33,709 --> 02:22:36,859
seems to be the right place that they do

2972
02:22:35,360 --> 02:22:38,870
it you guys like that I got right up

2973
02:22:36,860 --> 02:22:40,940
yeah they're gonna so they can kind of

2974
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:42,200
see us but haven't really cared we

2975
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:44,271
haven't done anything you haven't done

2976
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:46,221
in agra at all of them let's go check

2977
02:22:44,271 --> 02:22:47,480
out an iconic cluster okay yeah let's i

2978
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:48,529
guess if we're going to talk to him i

2979
02:22:47,479 --> 02:22:50,479
think we're gonna have to be

2980
02:22:48,530 --> 02:22:52,400
now let's recon first as much as we can

2981
02:22:50,479 --> 02:22:55,039
yeah yeah we have whatever minor

2982
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:59,841
advantage we have yeah so as you enter

2983
02:22:55,040 --> 02:23:02,181
this room as they are just sort of

2984
02:22:59,841 --> 02:23:06,860
existing together there's certain that

2985
02:23:02,181 --> 02:23:09,230
they're moving like one creature oh like

2986
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:11,900
like yeah i'm a Giunta they're all sort

2987
02:23:09,229 --> 02:23:13,459
of swaying around a central point like

2988
02:23:11,899 --> 02:23:16,880
gravity is being altered for each of

2989
02:23:13,459 --> 02:23:18,439
them in the same way simultaneously you

2990
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:21,039
don't see anything projecting from the

2991
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:23,329
roof you don't see anything projecting

2992
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:24,860
horizontally through the room they don't

2993
02:23:23,329 --> 02:23:29,030
appear to be standing around anything

2994
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:32,569
but each other okay Oh God come on man

2995
02:23:29,030 --> 02:23:34,909
they are the root of Jesus yeah the

2996
02:23:32,569 --> 02:23:36,739
murder of town and the other the edge of

2997
02:23:34,909 --> 02:23:38,181
perception check to see if maybe there's

2998
02:23:36,739 --> 02:23:40,610
something invisible that they're

2999
02:23:38,181 --> 02:23:41,511
clustering around sure yeah yeah you're

3000
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:45,681

yeah yeah just it just smug you can see

3054
02:26:21,351 --> 02:26:26,360
it's sort of like Nestle and resk trying

3055
02:26:24,171 --> 02:26:29,751
to find that exactly this is trying to

3056
02:26:26,360 --> 02:26:32,240
find exactly the right place to be on to

3057
02:26:29,751 --> 02:26:35,149
be on these horns it's like I got to

3058
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:38,601
find the place that's right for me smell

3059
02:26:35,149 --> 02:26:42,200
good forgot that back around back around

3060
02:26:38,601 --> 02:26:44,081
the the corner it just toddles off with

3061
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:46,310
a little one like that yeah yeah yeah

3062
02:26:44,081 --> 02:26:49,161
here they're they're doing their meld

3063
02:26:46,310 --> 02:26:51,950
dance around it back and around the

3064
02:26:49,161 --> 02:26:55,729
corner you can see that there is a final

3065
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:58,609
chamber at the end of what they're sort

3066
02:26:55,729 --> 02:27:02,831
of their Great Hall and you can see that

3067
02:26:58,610 --> 02:27:04,610
this room is entirely ensconced with

3068
02:27:02,831 --> 02:27:07,640
dance which is like the most kind of

3069
02:27:04,610 --> 02:27:10,400
mushrooms you'd find on the on the trunk

3070
02:27:07,640 --> 02:27:13,040
of a tree so leather goes flat certainly

3071
02:27:10,399 --> 02:27:15,880
I was very lucky it's a combination I

3072
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:21,460
mean it's a combination of flat

3073
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:25,760
mushrooms and what you perceive as eyes

3074
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:30,850
and then they congregate and all gaze

3075
02:27:25,761 --> 02:27:33,411
upon a central structure that is itself

3076
02:27:30,851 --> 02:27:39,171
covered with mushrooms okay

3077
02:27:33,411 --> 02:27:41,931
and eyes that is all the time that is

3078
02:27:39,171 --> 02:27:45,021
