certainly now let us like let's roll

50
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:20,099
back when last we saw our heroes

51
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:25,650
they had busied themselves trying to

52
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:28,079
ferret out a an interlocutor you know of

53
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,870
some kind in their midst

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,360
it turns out that some tea flings are

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,110
bad

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,360
occasionally evil horned people you know

57
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,070
it's a stereotype right but at the same

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,890
time like this is definitely a dangerous

59
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:51,329
assassin on top of that they party

60
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:53,519
busied itself managing the surplus of

61
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,940
rats quest that they had received from

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,930
Mayor Fran Elsa gorf here in the city

63
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:05,879
the cursed City of NEMA's ear you'd

64
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:09,260
manage some activities at the ironbark

65
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,329
in we're able to manage their rat

66
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:13,530
infestation heading north to the next

67
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,290
place that had been identified

68
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:20,849
you caught made the acquaintance of a

69
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:23,489
Dragonborn alchemist Talia chief

70
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:28,439
the bat murder large men's room they do

71
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:32,180
large Benjamin he reps it and their rats

72
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:36,569
had gotten into a delicious supply of

73
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,540
mystical potion rhe now exactly right

74
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:41,129
lightning wraps you know obviously well

75
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,409
represented in the fan art from last

76
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:47,310
week three guys they were just another

77
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:50,519
good just a friendly tuft a very strong

78
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,890
large rat also and then very fast rats

79
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,750
to Conway exactly but it added muscle it

80
00:03:52,889 --> 00:04:01,500
had destroyed the stairway up and in an

81
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:04,590
effort to secure a rope ladder from the

82
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,599
Attic while not dog grass has looked out

83
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:12,590
of a portal window and was able to see

84
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,569
the entirety of the city of Mnemosyne

85
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,540
and determined something novel perhaps

86
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:21,478
something that she had not expected

87
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:25,650
which is that the town itself appears to

88
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,729
reflect a natural shape the town appears

89
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:31,750
to be

90
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:35,610
constructed you know summoned created in

91
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:40,750
some mechanism to you know reflect

92
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:44,650
exactly the shape of a leaf and not the

93
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:51,040
hated icon of maelys as some might have

94
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:55,899
thought erroneously twist yeah but

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,150
anyway we'll find out no but that that

96
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:02,109
is don't write it that is the very

97
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:05,379
moment that we find ourselves walnut Don

98
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:10,420
grass absorbing this fascinating new

99
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:13,029
data um so I'm not here with a yak Cal

100
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:16,180
yak I keep thinking is impale yurt and

101
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:20,589
I'm like tell you but um some of the

102
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:23,550
hell yeah uh can I take this I want his

103
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:28,359
arms are just full of sure a rope ladder

104
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,040
then I go on I go can I ask you one

105
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,840
question

106
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,010
you can ask me many questions perfect

107
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,869
because it's probably where this is

108
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:39,909
going um I go what do you know about how

109
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:44,889
did members here come to be do you know

110
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:48,880
anything about this Hein city that were

111
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:51,060
in well the tower that we find ourselves

112
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:55,389
in now is not a part of the original

113
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,240
construction I have a means by which I

114
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:01,899
can move the tower from place to place

115
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,120
wherever business is best for someone of

116
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:06,250
my talents wherever the Benjamins are

117
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,199
not large enough that's right there you

118
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,480
go my judgment yet don't go changin

119
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,469
pendulum case it's all about lesser yes

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:17,819
yes lesser Benjamin there's a hole

121
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:24,580
obviously as a range of Benjamin he says

122
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:33,360
it is a strange town but not without

123
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:37,339
coin and it has a statistically average

124
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,879
level of strange herbs

125
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:43,659
stranger spices eleven herb since my

126
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:47,418
hello what what kind of strange herbs

127
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,410
secret the numbers are not the numbers

128
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:54,379
are not correct there are plants here

129
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:57,320
that generally speaking must be secured

130
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:01,089
at great expense from the Underdark

131
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,649
oh no I thought I smelled something

132
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:09,109
interesting and familiar well homey yeah

133
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:10,159
nice um where where when I if I were to

134
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,050
look at these strange plants where would

135
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:19,939
I go whose well like it is peddling

136
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:22,370
these I I secure them myself you do okay

137
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,379
and you get them from the Underdark and

138
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,079
sell them here and there's a market no I

139
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:30,168
need not a decent it just wrote as I

140
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,990
suggested you know ordinarily one would

141
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:37,459
have to secure them a great price I see

142
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,449
some of them are not legal in the

143
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,879
traditional sense

144
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:45,050
sure nor are they legal in the legal

145
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:48,290
sense okay yeah they're not legal plants

146
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,180
I don't think you could put legality on

147
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,350
plants anyway but let me try - sure

148
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,240
you'd be surprised

149
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,289
yeah they're probably legal in the

150
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,060
Underdark so I'm going to come up with a

151
00:07:56,288 --> 00:08:02,659
list of ones I might request and see if

152
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,139
you ready Howard them go ahead and spit

153
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:09,110
them out oh I like fancy pants it's a

154
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,639
it's a private discussion okay

155
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,788
these are from my youth that I've I

156
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,620
missed them yes when I was about 14 is

157
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:18,439
the first time it's called under cronic

158
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,939
have you heard of it under dank that's

159
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,719
it Johnny

160
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:28,219
okay okay in there and I'm I want to say

161
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:34,070
uh Olivia do you have any idea why they

162
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:36,918
would be flourishing here when this just

163
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,860
yet meh Monsieur doesn't show up on many

164
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:43,009
maps because it's a relatively dis

165
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:48,019
attend is of a relatively recent vintage

166
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:50,059
sure I do have questions as to how it

167
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:52,639
was able to be created

168
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:55,099
so soon and so far off the main roads

169
00:08:52,639 --> 00:09:00,769
that's the question on everybody's mind

170
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:04,580
I think that I think that myself and my

171
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:08,210
little tower are not long for this town

172
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,550
and then so I'm like around the other

173
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:14,089
party but I look at him just like I

174
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:19,219
think that that probably a smart idea

175
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:23,080
this makes to be made hmm

176
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,160
he turns around lowers himself down the

177
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,639
down the ladder that goes up to the

178
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:31,730
attic

179
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:35,120
throws it down down to the second floor

180
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:38,810
nails it into the top and you should be

181
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,759
able to get down from this area oh we

182
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:45,379
get down so do you ah all short you have

183
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,189
to roll to get to all those rubies just

184
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:52,700
Rosie um okay so we've essentially

185
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,260
finished the rep yeah you haven't you

186
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,290
have said you have satisfied the letter

187
00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:01,189
of the law on the surplus of rats quest

188
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:04,370
I have some thoughts about the fact that

189
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:09,020
it was glowing under the one red place

190
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,940
that ate our nemesis is fitting body

191
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,500
hood yeah I mean there's a couple of

192
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,810
spins there's that there's a dead body

193
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,580
we left in an alley right well she I

194
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:23,469
didn't kill everybody in budge I was

195
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:26,480
attacked by her so it was okay she's

196
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:29,060
still I feel listen I feel guilty

197
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
leaving a rotting body I did murder her

198
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,269
a heavy door restaurant I heard that

199
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,490
they have people probably healthy no

200
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:36,620
take care of that oh yeah they said I

201
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,350
did murder her but she was me

202
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,810
right yeah yeah yeah she said new things

203
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,450
well yeah she just kind of took a swipe

204
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:46,579
at me but I mean yeah city slickers you

205
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,190
know parents it was her dialectic right

206
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,670
I mean so if you were attacked - and

207
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:56,720
this was like a concerted effort by some

208
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:59,419
dark agents of this weird town to do me

209
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,160
in and you that's what I'm wondering is

210
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:03,809
I who would have known and if Sunday's

211
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,610
were like sea quality at best I did

212
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:07,559
to point you that's like the atom attack

213
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,169
see our does I mean technically fast and

214
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:13,729
great yeah who's really under assault

215
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:16,439
yeah what did you expect my taste buds

216
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,778
I'm nothing along the lines of what you

217
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,089
guys experienced you know that I did

218
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,639
there wasn't very disappointing halfling

219
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:26,310
named mark I knew it was gonna come back

220
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,490
so that's that just pretty effective for

221
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:31,649
me so you guys just had a good time

222
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:35,580
well right so at the time I told you to

223
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,838
see at bad bets sorry at best a thief do

224
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,710
you still have the birthday hat on right

225
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:44,300
now on the horse hire time I never took

226
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,379
it off yeah I think partially my vision

227
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:50,519
moving it do you quickly have to like

228
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:51,950
look over it in different ways I'm the

229
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:59,129
victim here

230
00:11:51,950 --> 00:12:03,150
um yeah like that's this this is the

231
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:05,309
city that we're in right now I it I know

232
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:06,539
this place and this has not been here

233
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,069
forever

234
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:11,120
I don't know how do you know the place

235
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:13,170
because I'm familiar with the area Rosie

236
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,120
because I'm familiar with the area

237
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:19,199
just care I've been this way once or

238
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,049
twice well how old is it can't be more

239
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,300
than like 50 60 years old right now

240
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:30,629
overnight camping more than 20 25 years

241
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:30,959
maybe last all this takes together all

242
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:34,230
right

243
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,540
oh that's what I'm saying is that so

244
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,879
they built a city to murder us and then

245
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,559
give you a bad restaurant experience

246
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,600
this is a lot of trouble I know every

247
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,669
bar sitting in the trap maybe it's just

248
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,050
a shitty thing I don't think that yeah

249
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:48,059
maybe really treat everyone like this

250
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,919
who knows what that banana here did way

251
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:54,088
try to kill YF of every party that comes

252
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,649
in yeah I am concerned that I was

253
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,400
specifically attached to us outside in

254
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:03,179
the alley alone and also the first was

255
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:06,088
maybe specifically attacked when his

256
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:10,469
body was taken over by or I guess didn't

257
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:13,050
was an imposter to him okay and we found

258
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,850
her all the way out in the smallest

259
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:16,709
retinas pieces to go we found her all

260
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,710
the way out in that deep Kronus

261
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:23,790
Yeah right how did she know that we were

262
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:26,220
going to go - she wouldn't fire from

263
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:28,860
here - Lee right right but then we just

264
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,379
happen to that day also get emissive and

265
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,850
then pull out we'll go to the wandering

266
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,529
and I mean this is an official document

267
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,149
to the best of my knowledge can I do a

268
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,120
roll actually to see if it's definitely

269
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,129
definitely an official like a true yeah

270
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,639
job there's a real job now I'm wondering

271
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:47,299
right yeah um yeah altered form if it's

272
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,299
not in the movie

273
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,389
uh oh

274
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:57,150
not it's getting good an 11-4 like a

275
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:59,370
perception check on it uh yeah I mean it

276
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,949
seems to be it's in order to in line

277
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,259
with the other jobs that you have

278
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,520
received okay to the best of your

279
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:10,080
knowledge I'm just in this world I'm

280
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,399
just wondering as in the smell test if

281
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,350
there are coincidences so great as

282
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,889
finding a traitor from a place that we

283
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,509
have a job to go to on the same day that

284
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:23,399
Hoover people are that's right it

285
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:26,970
wouldn't be hard for that person to set

286
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,889
up this rat business and then request on

287
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,330
behalf of the city and the mayor so I

288
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:32,759
don't think it's I don't know that he's

289
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,530
at the top but there is no one wage and

290
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,559
we didn't beat him until until we got to

291
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,480
get that money anyway I have to do I

292
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,189
work out yeah we went back to the cave

293
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,690
that has a deep groan essent because we

294
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,550
believed it was the wandering crypt yes

295
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,410
yes that's a lot of us we thought I were

296
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:48,029
told to go so we went back to

297
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:50,370
investigate the wandering crypt and we

298
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:53,519
found Devine who just happened to be in

299
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:58,259
there and we went back to the crypts at

300
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:01,439
omens bad yep any moment job an omen

301
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:04,279
gave us right but how would Devine have

302
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,680
known that omen gave us that job unless

303
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:09,769
then she must have been spying on Oak so

304
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,789
if there a way that they can be

305
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,529
observing those communications that

306
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:16,469
we're getting from Roman the hologram

307
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,779
who's they whoever who are they yeah

308
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,889
whoever this this Devine character and

309
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,569
this person who attacked you in the

310
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:25,230
alley if they are were a dirt out dirt

311
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,850
okay so we're just Cultus gonna be

312
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,379
darkening we know anything about that

313
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,190
symbol and that's how we know this is

314
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,019
regular occult

315
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,020
once a lot of people are involved we do

316
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:37,120
Hartl security and they luckily within

317
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:39,370
an hour someone attacked like we're

318
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,899
we're sociopaths to an extent right

319
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,639
commit a lot of murder

320
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,529
Oh everyone would become its let him

321
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,610
right here yeah but murder I do it's

322
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,339
okay it's not murder

323
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,990
covered under company policy yes it's

324
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,430
all under the policy on to the polls

325
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,960
okay I'm just saying this isn't anything

326
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:55,359
to act on but it's isn't a keep in mind

327
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,210
I guess strange that Disney would have

328
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,409
known where we were going to be I also

329
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,820
think that's strange

330
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:03,189
I think everything about it is strange

331
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,410
at this point let's go and let's go talk

332
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,170
to the mayor let's get paid because it

333
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:10,089
was a Hester why he won't pass oh hey

334
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:11,889
whose pain is gonna happen there's pain

335
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,960
I guess maybe you know say yes nothing

336
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:17,080
is remodeling that yeah and he's there

337
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,970
and he also like said as much when you

338
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,379
talk historically a payment if you think

339
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,060
back to the last jobs it's true

340
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,860
historically payment comes from the head

341
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,689
office because they take their cut first

342
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,539
right here okay but we want to switch it

343
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,890
so he was making some little promises

344
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:31,209
and yeah how do they any of all it'd be

345
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:35,080
a sweet nice boy when you're talking

346
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:39,070
tram go in there show me I'm a machine

347
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,509
yes okay that's what you want to do when

348
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,160
I just look into his eyes and see what

349
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:45,429
it's all about

350
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:50,289
yes so you make your way you make your

351
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:53,649
way down the rope ladder it's fairly

352
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:56,500
it's a fairly Cirque de Soleil type of

353
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,500
experience we look awesome yeah it's

354
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,259
it's very exciting at about in the

355
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,689
middle of the ladder when you're able to

356
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:07,959
get the rest of the way down and it's

357
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:11,470
quite a it's quite a hike back through

358
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:17,230
that Central Corridor back to the

359
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:21,338
mayor's home the camera moves away from

360
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:24,519
the party well what revenue I've got me

361
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:29,379
well I listening you're doing exactly I

362
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:31,389
get it um cameraman gets bored exactly

363
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,720
it's like see I need excitement he has a

364
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:42,580
time exactly so not be a role it's good

365
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:48,220
so a man stands in the doorway

366
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:50,528
of the mayor's house and enters in you

367
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:55,000
can sense behind him that there are

368
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:57,220
others but he enters the house alone and

369
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,730
as he does you can tell that for no

370
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:05,140
cigar expected to see someone else at

371
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:09,940
thee at the entrance but friend Elsa

372
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:13,778
Gore quickly adjusts his raiment to

373
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:16,720
deliver a facsimile of professionalism

374
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:21,609
the closest he is able to manage at any

375
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:26,769
rate and he seems surprised at this

376
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:29,859
guest and he says world right I didn't

377
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:34,470

inside hands the bottle to his guests

385
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:04,000
and it says Oh glasses goes back into

386
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:10,450
the kitchen it is at this point that the

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:31,059
the man uncork it again pour into each

391
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:33,819
Cup offer for Nelson or a glass he says

392
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:37,240
I understand that we had visitors from

393
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:40,720
an adventuring company and for no cigar

394
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,720
says oh yes we managed the you told me

395
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,538
to deal with the rats and I did so I

396
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,899
went to all the pillars of the community

397
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:53,500
asked if they had rat trouble created a

398
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:56,168
job I did this all myself would be God I

399
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,079
I secured the services of

400
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:01,629
acquisitions incorporated a well-known a

401
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:08,349
respected franchise I'd heard that they

402
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:13,048
had done some work in Westbridge and to

403
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:18,428
to great effect here continues exactly

404
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:21,158
see he says hmm sis did you make any

405
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:26,830
special note of the druid they had with

406
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:31,359
them and Fornell says I drew a daughter

407
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:35,349
of these forests I know that they held

408
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:41,349
sway in these parts for a time takes a

409
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:45,459
sip of his wine and the man the visitor

410
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:50,849
begins to sort of pace like a panther in

411
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:58,569
a cage he says she is a favored daughter

412
00:20:50,849 --> 00:21:04,178
of Maliki of a now-defunct order called

413
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:05,858
The Enclave panax anima now defunct but

414
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,259
they weren't without their trick they

415
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:12,489
weren't without their tricks did you

416
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:16,358
know it's a piece of trivia do you know

417
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:23,159
that they had a spell that would turn

418
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:23,158
the wine in a guests belly into thorns

419
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:33,908
so they have a reputation as being sworn

420
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:37,899
protectors of the natural world this is

421
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:41,499
how they did it with blood there is

422
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:46,298
another way the way you were to help me

423
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:55,358
manage he says what is your primary role

424
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:55,819
as a mayor of Mnemosyne and he says well

425
00:21:55,358 --> 00:22:02,779
to

426
00:21:55,819 --> 00:22:02,779
not to allow that I'm not - and

427
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:09,629
Blackthorn's

428
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:14,759
and blood erupt from his mouth and the

429
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:20,040
guest says I'll help you you were not to

430
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:25,230
allow the preconditions of prophecy you

431
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:30,109
have done so and you have failed me all

432
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:32,370
right so you continue through the tunnel

433
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:36,750
exactly about any of that knowledge yeah

434
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:40,589
yeah yeah Wow you continue through the

435
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:45,299
tunnel cool and as you'll recall the

436
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:49,769
mayor's little house sort of sits almost

437
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:53,329
like a pebble in the shoe of this giant

438
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:57,000
hill that exists in the center of town

439
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:58,909
as you approach the as you approach the

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,710
home you see it much as you did before

441
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:06,150
lights are on inside warm and cheery

442
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,309
compared to most of this place it has a

443
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,110
it's like like the iron bark in like it

444
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:11,099
it doesn't feel the same as the rest of

445
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:14,819

446
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:18,119

way right if you actually see one grow

shreds of robes and breeches sort of

470
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:24,579
suspended in this wriggling mass of

471
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:28,170
black thorns that are growing mouths

472
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:30,789
from a mass in the middle reaching up

473
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:33,220

508
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:21,099

to know if I can discern

559

561
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,650

00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:39,109
like

563
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,250
once it's demerit it's like maybe if I

564
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:43,159

an arrival right that's crazy

568
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:54,019
Gribble and cobbling together your your

569
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:56,899
lore knowledge and your regular

570
00:28:54,019 --> 00:29:01,250
knowledge just of the natural world

571
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:05,420
um it's seeking if it doesn't find much

572
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:07,880
soon that it will probably just shrivel

573
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,800
if this is not it's not grown in soil

574
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:16,010
you know what I mean like it really is

575
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:18,430
just this knot of thirsting roots you

576
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:25,000
better not go near it

it everybody's going to get their love

588
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,780
okay just a really good role yeah

589
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,379
everybody can get their lives so you get

590
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:02,480
set up on yeah camera right here that's

591
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,250
really all right here but that's the

592
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:11,599
real key that's the one thanks little

593
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:17,480
rough there to you there near you you

594
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:20,659
can you can see that someone came in but

595
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,019
never really got past halfway they came

596
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:28,160
in sir walked back and forth and then

597
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:31,339
left very recently you also see a bottle

598
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,190
of a silvery liquid on a table with one

599
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:36,559
empty glass and one full glass okay so

600
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,570
this looks like a case of poisoning that

601
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,940
looks all legitimate to me I would I

602
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:43,129
would agree okay it definitely seems

603
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,950
like that's a pretty novel configuration

604
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,990
yeah yeah yeah and well not just a good

605
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,450
one all that check this out

606
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,069
the the wine

607
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,100
I know that you love to drink than I

608
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:57,799
love my deposit you're a drunkard I is

609
00:30:55,099 --> 00:31:00,799
it it I pause for something I like yes

610
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:02,569
fair fair but this this seems like maybe

611
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,259
this is related to the scene that we see

612
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,829
in front of us

613
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:11,829
someone else was here I feel like at

614
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:16,299
this point why I feel like uh there are

615
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:18,559
stories of certain types of druids who

616
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:23,049
had this power in the past

617
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,669
I mean heroes of legend great protectors

618
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:27,289
the best through its really of all the

619
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,080
driz best huh okay

620
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:31,849
oh great sings violent for a druid well

621
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,710
tell me about this best druids only

622
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:36,199
happens

623
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:42,079
Dragonborn of druids yeah sure I guess

624
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:46,309
uh I want to point to NGOs um this is

625
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:48,289
something that no one has done to my

626
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:50,569
knowledge in a very long time

627
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:53,299
certainly on my lifetime and maybe not

628
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:55,750
in my mother's lifetime and this would

629
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:58,819
only happen if it a person was truly

630
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,549
deserving of punishment a black tender

631
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:04,039
let's start to sniff around your boot

632
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:07,549

00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,710
it with us I'm not gonna drink it okay

634
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:10,879

understand what you're saying really but

636
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,730

I've done is all I've burned is shatter

would you say that these foes are in a

847
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:49,960
20-foot cube because it can this cube

848
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,200

849
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:57,159

taken such care to dress in a spooky Hot

November damaged oh I see you I know I

884
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:25,528
little bit that - yeah yeah at the same

885
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:29,969

00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:43,469
cannot see because I'm going to do I'm

890
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:44,759
going to throw a hex on that fella my

891
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:46,679
understanding is that you're not a

892
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:47,938
missive you cast a spell as your major

893
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,130
the main part of your action you can't

894
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,509
cast a bonus spell did you boys actually

895
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,369
no I don't think so

896
00:44:51,509 --> 00:44:55,079
what that's what I thought that was a

897
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:58,650
bread and butter of this thing you hear

898
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,989
the bonus and then you get the action we

899
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,639
rule in but that's my understand your

900
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,929
secret dips actually the bonus snag

901
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,929
negative power yeah yes

902
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:08,818
in another huh it's a 58 laws of power

903
00:45:06,929 --> 00:45:10,318
my ex is your boss action that's it is a

904
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:11,548
bar section but I think it's a spell

905
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,588
I'll figure it out by the way it's very

906
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:15,958
far - I'm using it as a can trip - I

907
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:17,338
mean I can't use it it's once forever

908
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:19,469
but yeah it's my action because

909
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:21,179
ordinarily I do hex and then oh I know

910
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,880
one of these bad goes I'm trying to

911
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,380
figure out if that's just more rad

912
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,880
trying to decide if you get to do that

913
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,338
and all right well then I do bonus

914
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,989
action first on the one I don't plan on

915
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:32,849
hitting with the other yeah and then I

916
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:33,298
do the action that I always do is that

917
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:34,949
bad

918
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:37,528
yeah no just somebody came up they were

919
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:39,630
talking about on Twitter and you know

920
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:41,369
this one has some guy on Twitter yeah

921
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,019
yeah yeah but I thought I also saw a

922
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:44,640
comment that said that it says in the

923
00:45:43,018 --> 00:45:46,889
official rules that these are just

924
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,598
guidelines and if it's really really

925
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:50,879
yeah you know what I kept all my actions

926
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:52,410
no no no we're not gonna get that okay

927
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,289
you're not going to get that but I think

928
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:58,170
it's I think that's a hex combo I just

929
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:59,249
like how it feels I think I think that

930
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,199
I'm just going to let that happen

931
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:02,669
what that's my understanding for that

932
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,709
what that guy was saying yeah sorry but

933
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,970
this is everybody no no no my

934
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:07,559
understanding was that

935
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:10,889
where is the way I have in which I had

936
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,960
used hex was I I messed up an ability

937
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:14,730
check and then I attacked on that check

938
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,619
but that just has a way that works yeah

939
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,599
yeah I got I can do bonus in action but

940
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:20,460
my hex doesn't actually will be they

941
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,590
came more well in any case in a case

942
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:26,309
that's welcome to the land of rule 0

943
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:29,369
folks yeah yeah I just like that I like

944
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:31,799
that you spit some nasty curse at them

945
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,940
in addition to doing other stuff so

946
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,990
there's this very fire doesn't very far

947
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,539
so you basically you want to ask the

948
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:38,608
person who stayed out who is the person

949
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:40,079
and Bera spell and it doesn't damage

950
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:42,750
them because I didn't do damage to know

951
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,519

little like I'll up that swipe and then

1143
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:49,760

00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:55,039
elder slashguard yeah have our new

1145
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:58,340

out to you and you and strip it away

1147
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:06,309
from you no yes you instruct one of your

1148
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:08,780
attackers with your source cereal might

1149
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:11,480
Rosie be seen part of a complete

1150
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,750
breakfast okay so we have one down three

1151
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,219

dart nimble yep Oh order just to slide

1155
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:27,109

1156
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,450
many creatures that have other size

1157
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:31,579
larger than me and so I believe that

1158
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:34,339
these probably are I'm very small in

1159
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:38,210
there oh yes average yes so I flip out

1160
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:41,090

1430
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:29,389
you're able to distract them for a

1431
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:31,099
moment with that bizarre arc and I get

1432
01:09:29,389 --> 01:09:32,929
behind them and hold the staff against

1433
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:37,130
the against the neck basically it's like

1434
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:38,750
a takedown right blamed a living so

1435
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:40,548
there with using so they're with you on

1436
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:43,939
the ground

1437
01:09:40,548 --> 01:09:46,039
you're mobilized by this okay this hold

1438
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:47,710
all right so I'm going to ask them

1439
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:50,420
straight up first

1440
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:52,329
who they work for and if that doesn't

1441
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:55,489
work then I will try an intimidation

1442
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:58,368
they don't say anything and in fact

1443
01:09:55,488 --> 01:10:00,549
they're struggling mightily to escape I

1444
01:09:58,368 --> 01:10:05,349
tried an Elvish Andrew Connick

1445
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:09,100
well in case they don't speak comments

1446
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:17,380
nothing no okay I'm going to try an

1447
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:23,860
intimidation role that is a sixteen tell

1448
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:25,900
me how you try okay I've got I'm pretty

1449
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:28,059
intimidating as it is I am very small

1450
01:10:25,899 --> 01:10:30,159
but I have pinned them yeah yeah I'm

1451
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:34,420
bullying them with with a coarse ass

1452
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:37,840
right around other necks and I lean in

1453
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:40,020
and I say I suspect you know exactly

1454
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,400
what that wine does to a person

1455
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:44,410
and I want you to know that I have the

1456
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:47,889
rest of the ball you see you see that

1457
01:10:44,409 --> 01:10:51,250
their use their eyebrows crease at the

1458
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:54,160
mention of a wine okay there cuz they

1459
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:57,100
don't understand what's going on okay

1460
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:59,439
yeah I mean you you can mean it's clear

1461
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:01,900
like do to the extent that it's not even

1462
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:03,789
doesn't require like a intuition or

1463
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:06,429
something like that like that's that's

1464
01:11:03,789 --> 01:11:10,090
not connected to I think if I see that

literal in Hanceville some of guys

1560
01:15:39,738 --> 01:15:44,959
research I think you okay it's been in a

1561
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:45,619
circle Karam forever to prosper oh yeah

1562
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,069
good idea

1563
01:15:45,619 --> 01:15:54,738
but this time I do a I speak to the mind

1564
01:15:49,069 --> 01:15:58,969
to mind we don't have to say may without

1565
01:15:54,738 --> 01:16:01,849
loud just look at that she continues to

1566
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:06,649
shriek and scream but you can you can

1567
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:08,840
sense that catharsis is speaking

1568
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:11,839
directly like it and there is his body

1569
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:20,239
language has become conversational in

1570
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:23,569
its way so boy is that you who sent you

1571
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:28,429
I see the symbol you carry thank you

1572
01:16:23,569 --> 01:16:31,939
first oh this one yes you know it's like

1573
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:35,380
if you bear our symbol as well also

1574
01:16:31,939 --> 01:16:40,029
that's it who is this cuz I don't know

1575
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:45,920
it becomes come on I'm also confused

1576
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:51,590
but I am terrified that you would have

1577
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:55,248
that obelisk and not know let me help

1578
01:16:51,590 --> 01:17:01,099
you become less afraid why should you be

1579
01:16:55,248 --> 01:17:04,969
scared of this because it may list

1580
01:17:01,099 --> 01:17:08,869
shares nothing with anyone why would her

1581
01:17:04,969 --> 01:17:09,859
symbol be on that maybe she didn't share

1582
01:17:08,868 --> 01:17:13,069
it maybe

1583
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:16,130
my God took it from maybe you have

1584
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:21,170
adulterated the old ways maybe you

1585
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:23,118
adulterated your ways maybe you're not

1586
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:24,828
the cultivation you're like really sad

1587
01:17:23,118 --> 01:17:29,089
yeah yeah yeah exactly but the bottling

1588
01:17:24,828 --> 01:17:31,340
is just like you're just napping here uh

1589
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:37,340
Rosie beasting yeah I like that I do

1590
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:39,940
this the ER but in like 24 points I want

1591
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:45,590
to get that that vaguely occurred on

1592
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:48,138
television on a rigid etheric feels like

1593
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:49,909
Christmas hats as well in hand and is

1594
01:17:48,139 --> 01:17:59,958
now scanning for the source of the

1595
01:17:49,908 --> 01:18:08,078
crossbow bolt perception clamps na oh

1596
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:08,078
yeah works 21 nice good lord

1597
01:18:08,859 --> 01:18:17,988
there are so many that at first you

1598
01:18:15,069 --> 01:18:25,340
think you must not be seeing it

1599
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:27,169
correctly good run oh I mean Kate

1600
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:28,219
alright like you think you think that it

1601
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:30,979
might be some feature of the

1602
01:18:28,219 --> 01:18:33,439
architecture at first like a

1603
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:36,340
crenellations or you know what I mean

1604
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:39,649

1632
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:54,539
how they all do women by the way that's

1633
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:57,659
your guess just silhouette

1634
01:19:54,539 --> 01:20:00,720
generally speaking you have to make a

1635
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:03,739
more robust got sort of fragments

1636
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,740
exactly exactly

1637
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:13,680
you take three points three crossbow

1638
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:17,219
bolts sail from these roofs and find

1639
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:21,119
their way into this servant of MELAS

1640
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:24,390
if you hear just an exhalation in your

1641
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:28,019
mind just some artifact of the living

1642
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:30,510
the red and most of you you pull them

1643
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:32,220
you pull them back in and then you're

1644
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:36,260
back and the whole crew is immediately

1645
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:38,539
now in the midst of this writhing mass

1646
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,590
near the end of what it can accomplish

1647
01:20:38,539 --> 01:20:46,409
without

1648
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:47,640
feed give it the body what would its

1649
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:49,649
owner die

1650
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:51,600

on the but no jerk that's a me wanting

1660
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:20,040
to do one that was good

1661
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:22,019
which issue it okay so now we have a

1662
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:24,500
corpse so we should check out I want to

1663
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:26,790
look for symbols on it yeah I definitely

1664
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:29,250
immediately as soon as I see that are we

1665
01:21:26,789 --> 01:21:32,039
able to get around some are safe of this

1666
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:36,060
creeping Meza thorns within the room and

1667
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:37,529
the building it lives here okay so we

1668
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:39,510
should act to move this is it's this

1669
01:21:37,529 --> 01:21:41,759
Atlas your now there's no rooms clear of

1670
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:46,440
it well this I mean this this way is

1671
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:47,340
just a new venue for it can we try that

1672
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:48,629
anyway

1673
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:51,090
it's having it having a great time

1674
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:52,650
bathroom video so as so if it as how did

1675
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:59,310
you have firm as you have pulled it in

1676
01:21:52,649 --> 01:22:04,319
as the as the bolt strike your charge

1677
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:06,120
here but as soon as they go limp you see

1678
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,429
the dagger in the hand start to swing

1679
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:10,170
sort of like a windsock I point to it

1680
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:12,000
and I go ah this is about a good thing

1681
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:18,149
it's not really I told you to trust me

1682
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:21,449
look look like a hook oh yeah hold up

1683
01:22:18,149 --> 01:22:24,710
yeah it goes it goes directly in and

1684
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:28,979
sort of sticks in and shivers and shakes

1685
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:30,449
and then goes in and then the symbol of

1686
01:22:28,979 --> 01:22:34,789
male earth gets even stronger on the

1687
01:22:30,449 --> 01:22:37,739
surface and then I look at that and I go

1688
01:22:34,789 --> 01:22:41,340
curious why not I can't explain it

1689
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:46,279
but I don't like anymore now that I've

1690
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:48,900
seen it this this gross thing is

1691
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:51,750
encroaching on my God's territory

1692
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:52,679
oh my focus is it taking over your focus

1693
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,550
is that where you're afraid I thought

1694
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,230
they were just going to hang out

1695
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:58,260
together I thought that the other ones

1696
01:22:55,229 --> 01:23:01,979
would just would get absorbed by the

1697
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:03,840
strength of who I've chosen as my patron

1698
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:06,269
really is not what's happening I see

1699
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:09,170
that happen and I'm like and I take the

1700
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:11,169
dead bodies hands and make it go don't

1748
01:25:21,969 --> 01:25:25,899
the [ __ ] best

1749
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:28,808
now when last we saw her here

1750
01:25:25,899 --> 01:25:33,149
they were they had hold themselves up

1751
01:25:28,809 --> 01:25:38,400
inside the manners humble man's and were

1752
01:25:33,149 --> 01:25:42,158
absolutely 100% surrounded by assassins

1753
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:46,988
the daughters of maelys surrounding the

1754
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:54,098
hovel what do you do in the face of this

1755
01:25:46,988 --> 01:25:56,138
terror so we are trapped between a thorn

1756
01:25:54,099 --> 01:25:58,020
and a gang of mail services that yeah I

1757
01:25:56,139 --> 01:26:00,989
think it was gonna say this is a classic

1758
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:04,989
euphemism right that's one of Rosie's

1759
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:08,229
tried-and-true use mrs. um so veg there

1760
01:26:04,988 --> 01:26:10,479
is there there's a spell that I have

1761
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:12,218
called path without trace now this won't

1762
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:14,678
obscure us completely which is I believe

1763
01:26:12,219 --> 01:26:16,779
how I know exactly using it all

1764
01:26:14,679 --> 01:26:18,849
knowledge I feel like the description

1765
01:26:16,779 --> 01:26:20,500
the description sort of implies that you

1766
01:26:18,849 --> 01:26:22,538
can just do whatever the [ __ ] you want

1767
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,889
but it's not true I was radius from you

1768
01:26:22,538 --> 01:26:25,238
masking you and your companions from

1769
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:26,949
detection and if that ball you read

1770
01:26:25,238 --> 01:26:29,198
you're like ah we're invisible yeah it's

1771
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:32,198
exactly but the best spell ever yeah but

1772
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:34,629
actually everyone within 30 feet of

1773
01:26:32,198 --> 01:26:36,698
creature I choose has a plus 10 months

1774
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:38,710
to Dec 30 subject and can be tracked

1775
01:26:36,698 --> 01:26:40,269
except by magical means so if we want to

1776
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:42,849
try sneaking out

1777
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:44,619
I can buff all of our self checks okay

1778
01:26:42,849 --> 01:26:47,380
look it's me go so it should be like

1779
01:26:44,618 --> 01:26:49,448
passed with some trace just with minors

1780
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:51,069
popular pass without trace unless you

1781
01:26:49,448 --> 01:26:53,888
fail spell check but that doesn't fit on

1782
01:26:51,069 --> 01:26:55,000
the card yeah yeah we kind of go around

1783
01:26:53,889 --> 01:26:56,469
the edge and maybe like on the

1784
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,538
background oh yeah exactly

1785
01:26:56,469 --> 01:27:01,179
do that if that's not good you guys so

1786
01:26:58,538 --> 01:27:03,849

1787
01:27:01,179 --> 01:27:06,069
um here's another one they pretty spooky

1788
01:27:03,849 --> 01:27:07,960
yeah if we get I assume that we're in

1789
01:27:06,069 --> 01:27:09,969

01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:12,698
Vienna there I mean there are there are

1791
01:27:09,969 --> 01:27:14,550
windows but you know this is a like I

1792
01:27:12,698 --> 01:27:17,408
say it's not a it's a pretty humble

1793
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:20,650
abode because I could attempt to speak

1794
01:27:17,408 --> 01:27:23,229

01:30:40,658 --> 01:30:43,829
under the central throbbing core of this

1875
01:30:42,969 --> 01:30:47,020
mess

1876
01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:49,809
even the FEMEN the the friend that you

01:30:52,779 --> 01:30:59,439
gripped it temporarily is completely

1880
01:30:56,020 --> 01:31:01,120
gone it looks like a chainsaw the the

1881
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:02,439
different arms I think it's like I look

1882
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:04,510
at a sea star like it's like one of

1883
01:31:02,439 --> 01:31:08,408

1925
01:32:51,118 --> 01:32:54,969
prestidigitation to just make a little

1926
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:57,010
Kindle little Kindle yeah

1927
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:59,920
right now it's wet wood I mean it yeah

1928
01:32:57,010 --> 01:33:01,690
it takes him good know Patrick Rothfuss

1929
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:03,730
wants us to check for a basement or

1930
01:33:01,689 --> 01:33:05,799
cellar or secret passages or something I

1931
01:33:03,729 --> 01:33:08,109
was actually really good I was thinking

1932
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:09,400
cellar but I also like huh that's like

1933
01:33:08,109 --> 01:33:10,839
last time we went in a basement I don't

1934
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:12,098
want to we're surrounded I don't want to

1935
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,960
entrench morale I'm gonna tell you guys

1936
01:33:12,099 --> 01:33:15,969
this because if I do it then Jerry will

1937
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,489
punish me yeah somebody else good I did

1938
01:33:15,969 --> 01:33:19,750
think of attic what well you don't wanna

1939
01:33:18,488 --> 01:33:23,799
go any attic there's nowhere to go but

1940
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:25,510
it's spooky hey [ __ ] it it is yeah but

1941
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,250
it might be sort of Austin here well

1942
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:28,810
well if there's testing as I mean what's

1943
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:31,810
your problem yeah can I people it up

1944
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:33,400
yeah kind of see like a cursory kind of

1945
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:35,199
like look and see if there's like a

1946
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:38,319
business I'm like I see if this is going

1947
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:40,569
to have any kind of like 18 but there's

1948
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:43,469
there's definitely foes the difference

1949
01:33:40,569 --> 01:33:48,670
between the front and the back is that

1950
01:33:43,469 --> 01:33:51,698
in the back he has cut his garden into

1951
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:55,179
tall hedges oh okay

1952
01:33:51,698 --> 01:33:57,579
male 8 okay okay cool why don't we sneak

1953
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:59,649
out that way so just to be clear if I

1954
01:33:57,579 --> 01:34:02,460
you pass that trace on us and we are

1955
01:33:59,649 --> 01:34:07,658
behind cover we would get +10 dexterity

1956
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:09,899
bonus and advantage on I'm being sneaky

1957
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:11,639
covers exact for anyone come

1958
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:13,979
it would be difficult for them to track

1959
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,929

01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:08,789
consumers at the end of it that way it

1988
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:10,460

except for you yes

2027
01:37:02,298 --> 01:37:06,738
you're like rustle in the hedge okay

2028
01:37:04,338 --> 01:37:08,628
it's like I'm fine but my tail keeps

2029
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:10,268
hitting them it's like why are you more

2030
01:37:08,628 --> 01:37:13,309
time I wouldn't have to decide without

2031
01:37:10,269 --> 01:37:16,009
hair it to you you you sort of sneak out

2032
01:37:13,309 --> 01:37:18,048
and then walnuts it doesn't have art and

2033
01:37:16,009 --> 01:37:20,059
then Chris Chris takes out and the narc

2034
01:37:18,048 --> 01:37:25,788
comes out and says quiet quiet quiet

2035
01:37:20,059 --> 01:37:28,399
quiet [ __ ] back in the corner yes if

2036
01:37:25,788 --> 01:37:30,679
you think you stink typically like the

2037
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:34,338
common goal like this is it but where we

2038
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:36,769
trying to get to the tunnel yeah they're

2039
01:37:34,338 --> 01:37:38,958
away is there a route to the main road

2040
01:37:36,769 --> 01:37:41,029
we want to blend we want to get out go

2041
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:43,668
into the crowd it's near I mean this is

2042
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:45,409
the mayor's house is actually near that

2043
01:37:43,668 --> 01:37:47,988
right that route and that's that's

2044
01:37:45,408 --> 01:37:51,498
specifically where it's placed so you

2045
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:54,918
have so you have gone out into the maze

2046
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:57,918
like garden that he has manufactured for

2047
01:37:54,918 --> 01:38:01,479
himself in the back um he won't be able

2048
01:37:57,918 --> 01:38:01,479
to see it in the spring

2049
01:38:02,078 --> 01:38:07,368
anything strainer

2050
01:38:03,649 --> 01:38:11,869
um and immediately as soon as you leave

2051
01:38:07,368 --> 01:38:15,458
the back door uh first three of you

2052
01:38:11,868 --> 01:38:19,518
looking pretty good and then it's just

2053
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:22,278
poor porcupine DiNardo and RQ kind

2054
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:25,519
yeah next can so but honestly here

2055
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:28,519
that's a 2 and a 4 hmm nice it could be

2056
01:38:25,519 --> 01:38:31,909
way way WAY worse glad I up so these so

2057
01:38:28,519 --> 01:38:32,890
it's so both strike around the frame of

2058
01:38:31,908 --> 01:38:34,779
the

2059
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:38,260
of the house as the door opens and you

2060
01:38:34,779 --> 01:38:41,349
emerge I'm an affordable hit no no no no

2061
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:44,530
no I something I hear good damage I took

2062
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:47,470
no no no these are the D 20s ah these

2063
01:38:44,529 --> 01:38:50,380
means that you do know get hit hmm

2064
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:52,930
sorry so you hear you're trying to sidle

2065
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:56,230
around the back and then sort of lose

2066
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:58,030
yourself in the moment you can't let it

2067
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:59,859
go don't ever

2068
01:38:58,029 --> 01:39:03,609
there's plenty one time you can play

2069
01:38:59,859 --> 01:39:05,529
forever dad's linguini we just want to

2070
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:08,529
get out of the perimeter of this of this

2071
01:39:05,529 --> 01:39:10,029
uh right it's circle mentoring so we can

2072
01:39:08,529 --> 01:39:12,250
get up concrete abstractions

2073
01:39:10,029 --> 01:39:14,289
you can definitely attempt to create a

2074
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:18,100
distraction I want you for a friend say

2075
01:39:14,289 --> 01:39:23,079
yes or yes yes what kind of forest

2076
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:26,440
friends I would like to summon a small

2077
01:39:23,079 --> 01:39:27,550
woodland Bert no actually earth here's

2078
01:39:26,439 --> 01:39:29,679

2079
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:31,029
actually a crow nesting season if you

2080
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,800
get close to their nest they physically

2081
01:39:31,029 --> 01:39:35,380
dive by me this happened me I felt its

2082
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:38,770
claws on my skin for real quite a grip

2083
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:40,720

territorial like try and get them to

2089
01:39:47,859 --> 01:39:50,829
dive on the people that are trying to

2090
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:53,170
take aim at us like even if they just

2091
01:39:50,829 --> 01:39:55,149

2095
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:03,579
little bodies off of really nice get out

2096
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:06,039
yeah well I think it's pretty cool so so

2097
01:40:03,579 --> 01:40:08,680
I do like a whistle or something sure

2098
01:40:06,039 --> 01:40:11,109
wait how do you how do you want it just

2099
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:13,270
that you use your pro whistle um so I

2100
01:40:11,109 --> 01:40:20,859
can't do it but a cool person that can

2101
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:27,490
do the bird yeah yeah air horn of

2102
01:40:20,859 --> 01:40:37,299
whistles no that was and then Fox is a

2103
01:40:27,489 --> 01:40:40,989
lot of air one face the face of the of

2104
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:44,079
the hill that sort of Bluff looks smooth

2105
01:40:40,989 --> 01:40:46,109
but as you call you can you can detect

2106
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:48,899
that it's basically popped

2107
01:40:46,109 --> 01:40:54,239
Oh much like much like the the deep crow

2108
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:58,889
nest it's popped with tiny tiny nests

2109
01:40:54,239 --> 01:41:02,939
and immediately just these sheets of

2110
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:05,369
black bullets leap out and start to

2111
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:07,979
swoop over the roofs oh can I ask my

2112
01:41:05,369 --> 01:41:09,569
flavor yeah absolutely and I say as I

2113
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:13,379

sort of like a little wave it's

2366
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:47,689

2380
01:54:18,909 --> 01:54:20,409

2381
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:22,809
you

2382
01:54:20,409 --> 01:54:24,309
we're taking that statute of bass while

2383
01:54:22,810 --> 01:54:26,830
you guys are doing it I've already begun

2384
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:28,990
to that's all I knew I'm going so that

2385
01:54:26,829 --> 01:54:32,100
it doesn't get angered yeah exactly

2386
01:54:28,989 --> 01:54:36,929
I'm sick okay so this thing basically

2387
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:39,960
like a single creature with with greater

2388
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:42,310
intensity and enthusiasm you see Devine

2389
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:47,130
sort of pushing through always sort of

2390
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:49,930
in the epicenter of this wake of rodents

2391
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:53,560
I'm listen I just I had this I'm just

2392
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:56,770
describing with a Bini so it sort of

2393
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:58,990
rises up almost like a prowl in front of

2394
01:54:56,770 --> 01:55:01,180
the party constantly rats are constantly

2395
01:54:58,989 --> 01:55:02,679
rising and spilling up over it it's

2396
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:05,820
almost like a cowcatcher

2397
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:09,190
right type situation in front of train

2398
01:55:05,819 --> 01:55:12,489
and it's just guiding you through

2399
01:55:09,189 --> 01:55:15,159
streets that you haven't seen yet into

2400
01:55:12,489 --> 01:55:18,579
new parts of this town skirting the

2401
01:55:15,159 --> 01:55:22,840
hammock district sorry says yeah the

2402
01:55:18,579 --> 01:55:28,479
rest you find a you ultimately end up in

2403
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:30,390
a sort of statuary garden there's a what

2404
01:55:28,479 --> 01:55:35,109
should be a fountain in the center

2405
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:37,980
currently dry and you can see a figure a

2406
01:55:35,109 --> 01:55:41,679
cloaked figure with a forced smile

2407
01:55:37,979 --> 01:55:44,439
reaching out toward whoever would

2408
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:50,289
approach this statue and at the base of

2409
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:52,539
it it says Mendez veil and they lead

2410
01:55:50,289 --> 01:55:57,310
they sort of boil up over the edge in

2411
01:55:52,539 --> 01:55:59,890
like a froth of rat and you can see that

2412
01:55:57,310 --> 01:56:05,200
as they approach a grate in the base of

2413
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:07,450
the fountain is raised up and the party

2414
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:09,149
is directed down below this statute

2415
01:56:07,449 --> 01:56:12,868
sewers

2416
01:56:09,149 --> 01:56:16,439
so I love Mendez mail never follow a

2417
01:56:12,868 --> 01:56:19,380
right to a second location like this is

2418
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:21,059
what a1 101 because they say yeah yeah

2419
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:23,039
alright it's like the most common idiom

2420
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:26,610
never know you're a quick perception

2421
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:29,698

yeah he is it appears to be it's not

2431
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:04,679
doing anything odd or strange but you

2432
01:57:01,649 --> 01:57:10,649
notice that this figure is wearing

2433
01:57:04,679 --> 01:57:12,599
something similar can I do perception to

2434
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:16,379
know if I know it's do I recognize this

2435
01:57:12,599 --> 01:57:17,869
at all try the name or the history I see

2436
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:22,829
that's good

2437
01:57:17,868 --> 01:57:24,059
woo-hoo-hoo-hoo 24 paper so totally tell

2438
01:57:22,829 --> 01:57:26,550
me exactly what you're trying to learn a

2439
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:31,619
very good want to know the guys

2440
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:36,690
recognize the person that is like

2441
01:57:31,618 --> 01:57:39,809
personified in this statue get a 24 I

2442
01:57:36,689 --> 01:57:48,149
had eight share 20 I have an 18 plus 6

2443
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:53,760
24 you wouldn't want you don't like what

2444
01:57:48,149 --> 01:57:56,819
you see ok that's it

2445
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:59,730
yeah you what you see it would be easier

2446
01:57:56,819 --> 01:58:03,630
for someone else ok someone who didn't

2447
01:57:59,729 --> 01:58:06,329
have the level of investment that you

2448
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:08,730
have in your own identity it would be

2449
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:11,250
easier for them to see it all right but

2450
01:58:08,729 --> 01:58:16,169
these these features are not alien to

2451
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:18,090
you ok well I want to roll the time

2452
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:19,770
anyone else is rolling by check

2453
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:22,470
something you suck you know

2454
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:26,320
all right the statue guys

2455
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:29,230
that guy I was confirming yeah guy we're

2456
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:32,019
right on the nose wrap everybody else oh

2457
01:58:29,229 --> 01:58:33,129
did you see Emily's reps I said I grab

2458
01:58:32,020 --> 01:58:35,530
the clothes for wanting things have you

2459
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:37,539
killed your friends like a lot of rats

2460
01:58:35,529 --> 01:58:38,619
we clearly haven't taken care of the rat

2461
01:58:37,539 --> 01:58:41,050
problem yeah exactly

2462
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:45,460
if you hear the wrong or greater our job

2463
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:47,619
like guys all right I want to go in the

2464
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:48,970
sewer I get aa plan to study exactly so

2465
01:58:47,619 --> 01:58:51,519
that so they've continued to make this

2466
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:52,990
place for you it just like a circle that

2467
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,570
sort of exists around you wherever you

2468
01:58:52,989 --> 01:59:00,989
go as you find yourself as you find your

2469
01:58:55,569 --> 01:59:04,000
way down this is definitely the sewers

2470
01:59:00,989 --> 01:59:08,039
yeah this is this is definitely in a

2471
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:10,479
sewer Ian context but so they are clear

2472
01:59:08,039 --> 01:59:13,840
basically running through this with you

2473
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:16,479
know absolute you know cartographical

2474
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:18,460
knowledge of this area obviously for you

2475
01:59:16,479 --> 01:59:22,419
it's brand-new but they're leading you

2476
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:26,670
very quickly through a chamber after

2477
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:30,250
chamber and on at least two occasions

2478
01:59:26,670 --> 01:59:33,699
you they walk through walls

2479
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:36,100
I don't like anything about it we're

2480
01:59:33,699 --> 01:59:39,189
very trusting disease right so so

2481
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:43,390
basically there are two places in this

2482
01:59:39,189 --> 01:59:48,399
in this traversal that you go through

2483
01:59:43,390 --> 01:59:50,289
illusory log walls yeah okay I'm making

2484
01:59:48,399 --> 01:59:52,569
a map of this as we go at least mentally

2485
01:59:50,289 --> 01:59:54,329
yeah yeah okay can i because when we've

2486

in their mouth before it hits the ground

2494
02:00:11,310 --> 02:00:16,450
that's why you bought the sack of grain

invigorated corpse mm-hmm just sort of

2505
02:00:38,988 --> 02:00:43,179
shuttering and the head doesn't appear

2506
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:45,860
to really know what it should be doing

2507
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:49,010
it's like not it's like the not it's

2508
02:00:45,859 --> 02:00:50,899
like it's like um playing it like like a

2509
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:52,670
play school of my first body right

2510
02:00:50,899 --> 02:00:55,579
thanks anyway shad with it buy something

2511
02:00:52,670 --> 02:00:57,469
yes and have that is a co-op since yes

2512
02:00:55,579 --> 02:01:02,029
yes exactly it's wonderful scent co-op

2513
02:00:57,469 --> 02:01:03,649
its clock worthy so you after you've

2514
02:01:02,029 --> 02:01:06,170
passed through the second of these two

2515
02:01:03,649 --> 02:01:08,389
illusory walls in addition to all the

2516
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:11,810
twists and turns that got you down into

2517
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:17,289
this zone you enter a chamber that has a

2518
02:01:11,810 --> 02:01:24,520
glow much like the glow from the rats

2519
02:01:17,289 --> 02:01:28,659
except on a massive scale you can see

2520
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:32,570
you know this instinctively it's risk

2521
02:01:28,659 --> 02:01:37,279
the architecture that's here is not

2522
02:01:32,569 --> 02:01:39,738
surface architecture are these places

2523
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:43,119
that I would these are deep either leave

2524
02:01:39,738 --> 02:01:48,319
places and it's in fact it's a low sim

2525
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:51,380
place even to him even I would say I

2526
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:54,139
would say that let me describe the image

2527
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:57,079
and then I will go into why it's

2528
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:59,150
important yeah even beyond the revulsion

2529
02:01:57,079 --> 02:02:04,149
that you would have it's even worse for

2530
02:01:59,149 --> 02:02:07,670
koutris there is something like a

2531
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:11,479
wishing pool or a scrying pool cracked

2532
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:13,819
in places in the central chamber you can

2533
02:02:11,479 --> 02:02:16,129
see it's sort of in a the entire room is

2534
02:02:13,819 --> 02:02:19,849
sort of in a triangular shape and this

2535
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:22,369
is set in a circle that's shattered it

2536
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:24,590
could no longer hold what it should

2537
02:02:22,369 --> 02:02:31,309
whatever was designed to hold and then

2538
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:36,079
you can see shot through by three long

2539
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:37,460
spars of root or what passes for a Rudy

2540
02:02:36,079 --> 02:02:39,289
you recognize it in the sink it leaves a

2541
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:45,130
root but it appears to be made out of a

2542
02:02:39,289 --> 02:02:49,449
kind of stone right it's shot through

2543
02:02:45,130 --> 02:02:54,140
what appears to be a massive

2544
02:02:49,449 --> 02:02:57,439
okay that is giving off the same light

2545
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:59,390
that the cranium rats give off but you

2546
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:03,500
you think that this can't possibly be

2547
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:06,260
the optimal scenario for this so this is

2548
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:10,310
this is stone roots reaching down from

2549
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:13,820
the city and then it looks like a like a

2550
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:18,230
skin on a drying rack like it's held up

2551
02:03:13,819 --> 02:03:23,509
in it's sort of held up on this vertical

2552
02:03:18,229 --> 02:03:29,089
shape splayed out across the roots this

2553
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:32,270
is an elder brain like this this is the

2554
02:03:29,090 --> 02:03:37,250
hated foe like the end point in a

2555
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:43,850
lifecycle of the elephant race the mind

2556
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:48,229
flayer I see just like be the enemy the

2557
02:03:43,850 --> 02:03:52,760
enemy Oh killer no filler yeah and a

2558
02:03:48,229 --> 02:03:55,750
body yeah yeah it did it yeah no and

2559
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:58,250
this brain is how big massive okay

2560
02:03:55,750 --> 02:04:02,689
massive but like I say like a like a

2561
02:03:58,250 --> 02:04:05,020
giant look at like a buffalo skin or

2562
02:04:02,689 --> 02:04:09,589
something on a drying rack like its

2563
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:12,560
massive and strained and splayed out and

2564
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:15,079
edema glow it is it is identical

2565
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:17,770
identical to the rest I bet he's really

2566
02:04:15,079 --> 02:04:20,300
smart good

2567
02:04:17,770 --> 02:04:22,490
is there like a tiny little rat under

2568
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:24,199
there no no you know the other types

2569
02:04:22,489 --> 02:04:26,479
there's a tiny little curtain you open

2570
02:04:24,199 --> 02:04:27,710
up that need to love no there's no

2571
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:28,129
there's message there's nothing like

2572
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:29,930
that

2573
02:04:28,130 --> 02:04:33,050
and in the press in the presence of this

2574
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:36,829
in the presence of this light Devine

did you come to be here

2610
02:06:28,179 --> 02:06:35,469
when the city was born it turned up

2611
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:48,550
great heaps of the Underdark

2612
02:06:39,738 --> 02:06:48,549

people for help

2618
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:21,399
presents certain complexities but I know

2619
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:28,510
without asking that both of us despise

2620
02:07:21,399 --> 02:07:31,210
this city the Spy's is a strong word but

2621
02:07:28,510 --> 02:07:33,460
if I had to choose how long have you

2622
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:34,179
been here oh not as long as you I

2623
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:40,359

that it's like when I live in a balloon

2629
02:07:52,448 --> 02:07:56,198
is flying around the room she's thinking

2630
02:07:55,389 --> 02:07:58,840

2631
02:07:56,198 --> 02:08:02,799
second did you just I mean you take your

2632
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:04,869
place up on the safe up on the top what

2633
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:11,380
what do you what are you looking for us

2634
02:08:04,868 --> 02:08:12,549
to do the roots of this town are grown

2635
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:19,118
through me and they have made it

2636
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:23,679
impossible for me to return why would I

2637
02:08:19,118 --> 02:08:31,000
help you because I can give one of your

2638
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:39,719
number something they did not know still

2639
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:45,429
existed again sweat sweat very stoic but

2640
02:08:39,719 --> 02:08:49,510
sweaty what is required of us the roots

2641
02:08:45,429 --> 02:08:57,269
that bind me here must be destroyed

2642
02:08:49,510 --> 02:09:00,029
closer to their source the source with

2643
02:08:57,269 --> 02:09:02,878
visible from the surface no they must be

2644
02:09:00,029 --> 02:09:09,019
destroyed from below the buildings

2645
02:09:02,878 --> 02:09:17,838
themselves here have roots to the street

2646
02:09:09,019 --> 02:09:22,260
yeah you get your spicy meat-a-ball

2647
02:09:17,838 --> 02:09:30,439
should we decide to do that what becomes

2648
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:30,439
of you I leave and I grant you my boom

2649
02:09:31,819 --> 02:09:37,169
does the city benefit from you being

2650
02:09:34,288 --> 02:09:37,978
trapped here does someone benefit from

2651
02:09:37,168 --> 02:09:40,288
you being trapped

2652
02:09:37,979 --> 02:09:45,298
I think the birth of this city had many

2653
02:09:40,288 --> 02:09:52,878
unintended consequences I'm trying not

2654
02:09:45,298 --> 02:09:57,538
to take it personally then I often yeah

2655
02:09:52,878 --> 02:09:58,979
yeah I'm like real boy 749 they bring no

2656
02:09:57,538 --> 02:10:01,168

2662
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:17,519

2663
02:10:15,748 --> 02:10:18,958

02:10:22,078 --> 02:10:30,658
would like to I can have a deep deep

2667
02:10:28,529 --> 02:10:32,479
knowledge deep thoughts by who we reach

2668
02:10:30,658 --> 02:10:39,448
it further back hmm

2669
02:10:32,479 --> 02:10:44,519
it says one moment when you think a

2670
02:10:39,448 --> 02:10:49,918
thing is that different from saying yes

2671
02:10:44,519 --> 02:10:52,109
yes fortunately yes I apologize do you

2672
02:10:49,918 --> 02:10:56,519
know anything about a thing called a

2673
02:10:52,109 --> 02:11:02,010
wandering crypt Oh Oh tell me more the

2674
02:10:56,519 --> 02:11:04,019
Crypt and it kind of wanders it's a

2675
02:11:02,010 --> 02:11:06,748
living dungeon yes

2676
02:11:04,019 --> 02:11:08,849
it moves any moving so the enemy of 1

2677
02:11:06,748 --> 02:11:11,069
ohm and ran

2678
02:11:08,849 --> 02:11:13,230
I've never heard the name I'm innocent

2679
02:11:11,069 --> 02:11:14,880
have you ever heard have you ever heard

2680
02:11:13,229 --> 02:11:16,888
of a phenomenon like that moving

2681
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:20,520
wandering done we do not call them that

2682
02:11:16,889 --> 02:11:23,489
well you call something else what's it

2683
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:30,750
called was that this is a beast that

2684
02:11:23,488 --> 02:11:35,309
burrows like a mole but is a domicile a

2685
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:39,229
construction this is a question oh yes

2686
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:42,090
yeah seems like they're not unheard of

2687
02:11:39,229 --> 02:11:43,769
all right so this isn't just one because

2688
02:11:42,090 --> 02:11:45,599
it's either a kind of thing where you

2689
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:48,170
can you say the word that you call them

2690
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:50,670
that is it something that we could

2691
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:53,219
absolutely we should even understand or

2692
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:56,359
parse or is it an elephant thing you

2693
02:11:53,219 --> 02:12:03,118
hear a sound that is like a mixture of

2694
02:11:56,359 --> 02:12:05,848
like breaking mason jars and uh parcel

2695
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:08,609
mouths okay hold on just a second oh

2696
02:12:05,849 --> 02:12:09,569
yeah that makes sense cool we were gonna

2697
02:12:08,609 --> 02:12:14,368
try and remember that

2698
02:12:09,569 --> 02:12:17,519
hi got it don't in the bulk her the

2699
02:12:14,368 --> 02:12:21,469
night on my back today was that date I

2700
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:27,179
said why would why would that thing

2701
02:12:21,469 --> 02:12:30,779
leave behind the symbol of the one who

2702
02:12:27,179 --> 02:12:37,469
controls pounds I know realism it's a

2703
02:12:30,779 --> 02:12:42,590
good call random I think I was here from

2704
02:12:37,469 --> 02:12:48,118
the birth of this town and whoever

2705
02:12:42,590 --> 02:12:55,050
planted its seed did not truly

2706
02:12:48,118 --> 02:12:59,359
understand what they were doing okay you

2707
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:59,360
have a name friend

2708
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:08,510
do you meet many elder brains well no

2709
02:13:06,409 --> 02:13:09,949
but it seems so impersonal elder brain

2710
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:13,039
will suffice we have a habit of being

2711
02:13:09,949 --> 02:13:14,500
betrayed by people we we help so I just

2712
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:16,850
want to know who to curse after you

2713
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:19,460
inevitably betray the elder burn yeah I

2714
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:22,250
wanna assign a name to me I'll call you

2715
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:24,789
elder brain one just in case we need

2716
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:28,310
enough I I suspect that a mind like this

2717
02:13:24,789 --> 02:13:32,329
would have we have already been betrayed

2718
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:35,510
if that's what's going on here so other

2719
02:13:32,329 --> 02:13:40,850
than that possibility I don't think that

2720
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:43,329
we have a quarrel we will perform this

2721
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:46,900
task for you

2722
02:13:43,329 --> 02:13:51,319
next one we should write up a contract

2723
02:13:46,899 --> 02:13:53,920

2724
02:13:51,319 --> 02:13:56,569

like it's all the rats gonna sign that

2732
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:23,869
would be sorry I did not a rat

2733
02:14:20,029 --> 02:14:26,840
scurrilous a rat scurries up onto the

2734
02:14:23,869 --> 02:14:29,738
document and then reads it lightly the

2735
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:35,539
whole body the whole head have to move

this to let just yank that from your

2738
02:14:37,970 --> 02:14:44,090

02:19:57,829 --> 02:20:03,649
found it in a deep place show the focus

2839
02:20:01,190 --> 02:20:07,700
and maybe show it to myself so I can see

2840
02:20:03,649 --> 02:20:09,649
oh sure my eyes I found it in a deep

2841
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:15,230
place perhaps not as deep as yours

2842
02:20:09,649 --> 02:20:18,529
it says but if its resonant like a like

2843
02:20:15,229 --> 02:20:20,899
a cello note it can't possibly it can't

2844
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:22,460
possibly fill the room because it's

2845
02:20:20,899 --> 02:20:25,100
completely in your mind but you feel

2846
02:20:22,459 --> 02:20:28,549
your skull vibrating with it and it says

2847
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:31,210
the air hasn't been worshipped for a

2848
02:20:28,549 --> 02:20:31,209
thousand years

2849
02:20:31,870 --> 02:20:37,780
do you serve it I tried my best

2850
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:51,470
his power ceased when he no longer

2851
02:20:42,709 --> 02:20:54,019
answered prayer ah it sounds it sounds

2852
02:20:51,469 --> 02:20:57,369
like a joke but I first thing that I

2853
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:57,370
thought was like agree to disagree

2854
02:20:58,459 --> 02:21:01,909

2855
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:04,340
don't even get true you may not know

2856
02:21:01,909 --> 02:21:07,069
it's true it's true though hey we got a

2857
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:08,840
cruel jobs we got three routes to manage

2858
02:21:07,069 --> 02:21:13,909

2859
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:17,000
