1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,869
time is the enemy the pastor threatens

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,120
the fastest weapon you wouldn't make it

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,830
past a second and that's the question

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,129
play it brash and reckless to choose a

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,320
car solution you saw was prudent in any

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,170
simpler poker to don't become the putrid

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,910
it's that wealth said I pursue in no

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,010
mountain too steep for dungeon too deep

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,929
to send expanded remarks up to the top

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,820
of the peak of beneath they see Yugi

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:25,320
they come like sharks to it while I swim

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,268
in that money build like Carl Barks

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,768

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:44,239
as though Jim is to blame it is well and

60
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,669
canonical canonically Jim is to blame

61
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,489

yeah I just listen I'm just happy to be

73
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:17,988
here so walnut on grass there should

74
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,419
inside your documents yours pouch the

75
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,230
new one with the nice stitching there is

76
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:26,449
also a pouch with a hundred gold pieces

77
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:30,828
in it when I went back and saw the

78
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:32,929
episode I don't believe that Mike I

79
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,939
don't believe that my cohort offered up

80
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,659
the gold that omen said that he

81
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:40,340
convenient indeed that Holman said that

82
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:42,949
he owed you since then we all got a

83
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,739
hundred actually that's a lie apart from

84
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:47,268
the pit of hell yeah did you watch the

85
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,459
whole thing he did say that he said I

86
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,139
got 200 yeah he didn't he said you're a

87
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,329
real handsome yeah that was handsome

88
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,950
he's away right now but when he comes

89
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,780
back I'll do karate onion during during

90
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:59,780
Table Talk he was tell me how handsome I

91
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,789
was real real life Ryan I saw that yeah

92
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:06,620
not the dragon I was not just drinking

93
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:09,798
it yeah yeah he was my daddy be really

94
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,739
proud so when last we saw heroes I guess

95
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,989
technically there's two layers here so

96
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:20,959
when we last saw a parentless they were

97
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:24,399
competing in wizard kart a whole IP that

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,329
is wholly owned by Penny Arcade

99
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,929
completely original it hasn't seen

100
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:29,149
anything like

101
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,129
Oh reflection please I didn't card with

102
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:34,609
the K that's how it's changed yeah

103
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:36,978
exactly we put the script yeah but when

104
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,060
we had seen our heroes before that

105
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:40,930
mm-hmm

106
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,600
there were a couple different scenarios

107
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,660
that I want to refresh the shadow

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:54,500
council on so that they might make their

109
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:59,020
will known so on the Horde a river going

110
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,019
house of chants operated by lizard folk

111
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:07,550
Brahma is performing on the stage I keep

112
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:09,740
singing ami but it's not a me it's not a

113
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:15,668
me it's walnut on grass you're right

114
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:18,860
walnut done grass looking on hard face

115
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:22,310
ready to deal with [ __ ] and very nearly

116
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,129
had to because splooge off on the upper

117
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,740
deck indeed split off the returned had

118
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:29,978
to be got a protect in Deva so to speak

119
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,990
had to be wrestled away from the edge

120
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:38,300
after being dominated by a strange

121
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:41,348
rhythm from Brahmas lute now in the

122
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:46,038
belly of the ship and indeed beyond

123
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:50,990
share be stinger played this afternoon

124
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:53,300
by Jerry Hawkins we tried we tried our

125
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,400
best but she has she can't just come

126
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,360
play D&amp;D with us which is all I want

127
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:02,388
yeah but share and Rosie be stinger as

128
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,848
well as cthis trout had emerged through

129
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:11,269
a strange vault that was controlled by a

130
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:14,870
weird skeletal serpent that longs to eat

131
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:17,629
not creatures but their deaths it was a

132
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,930
very odd conversation but emerging from

133
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:25,430
there you came to a place that seemed to

134
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:29,810
be between worlds half stuck in the

135
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,750
physical plane and then bleeding the

136
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:36,129
other half into a dark and wispy realm

137
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,278
that Rosie be stinger recognizes

138
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,110
instinctively

139
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:43,339
as a place of

140
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,800
mm-hmm so as we discussed before rosy

141
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:48,429
bee stingers

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,860
monastic tradition uses shadow as a

143
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,800
metaphor but you're starting to wonder

144
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,408
if there is a deeper meaning to all of

145
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,280
those lessons if it doesn't refer to an

146
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:05,990
actual place and the denizens that live

147
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:09,408
there seated on a table that sits itself

148
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:14,079
between these two worlds appear to be

149
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:19,788
reflections of one another you can see a

150
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:24,769
lizard royalty a lizard king seated on a

151
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:27,889
throne almost like a but emaciated

152
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,698
almost like a mummy clutching a purple

153
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,918
gym

154
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,050
indeed the gym that it was suggested

155
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,000
would be on this boat and could be

156
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,028
strolling that might be very difficult I

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,819
guess I guess we'll see how it goes

158
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:44,269
across from him is a is a more Hale more

159
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:49,848
Hardy reflection of that same figure and

160
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:55,758
to the shadow Kings left is a woman in a

161
00:07:49,848 --> 00:08:01,870
black and red cloak and by her side is a

162
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:07,460
sword that can apparently kill maim and

163
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:12,680
dismember without visually being removed

164
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:15,769
from its scabbard indeed one of the last

165
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,848
things that occurred when we played a

166
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:23,149
couple weeks ago was that a challenger

167
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:25,699
named dawn lariat who seemed to think

168
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:28,128
that he at long last

169
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:32,269
would be able to test himself against

170
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:36,349
rosy be stinger was in fact functionally

171
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:38,990
speaking filleted in a matter of seconds

172
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:42,169
and then to R and then what was left of

173
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:45,490
him was dragged away by the shadow Kings

174
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:49,789
guards here are the things that you know

175
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:52,399
as you came into this place you saw

176
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:53,000
whoever was you know standing to the

177
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,450
right

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,129
the Lizard King had literally been flung

179
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:04,190
into the sky as near as you could tell

180
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:08,230
you as you approached it was implied

181
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:11,390
that you were some kind of replacement

182
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,210
intercessor someone here to bargain on

183
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:17,120
behalf of the Lizard King

184
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,950
with these strange agents that are

185
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,429
arrayed on the opposite side of the

186
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:25,790
table okay

187
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:28,519
the agents that I can see are the Shadow

188
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:30,860
King indeed and your servant to the left

189
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,079
the cloaked woman indeed and it sounds

190
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,539
like there are guards somewhere hidden

191
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,990
that hauled Dawn lariats pieces away

192
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:43,509
indeed so just beyond you would describe

193
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:46,639
it as you know tastefully beyond the

194
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:49,340
conversational area as clearly that the

195
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:52,460
the remit of this royalty and these

196
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:55,040
intercessors they sort of form a ring

197
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,070
behind that that protects the

198
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,779
proceedings from people like Don Lariat

199
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,160
who think they've it's you know it's

200
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:03,439
their time to shine right

201
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:06,079
and Don lariat came in and made a

202
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,450
declaration against rosy Pete's dinger

203
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,670
indeed um and I've never seen that dude

204
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,650
in my life I don't know who that jabroni

205
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:15,099
was no no no you are not familiar with

206
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:20,120
anyone named Don Lariat now people

207
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:23,870
instigating marshal contests you know is

208
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,629
not unheard of sure you know there is a

209
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,490
there is a hierarchy it's not one that

210
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:31,700
you prize sure but there is a hierarchy

211
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,379
of martial skill right you know for

212
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,860
Rosie I think it's more of a means to an

213
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:37,338
end

214
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,930
right right and I suppose having people

215
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,400
come in and challenge her martial

216
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,529
Authority has been something that has

217
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,199
happened to her in the past so perhaps

218
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,209
it's not completely strange but it is

219
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,680
strange that it happened here yes you

220
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:57,320
did so okay all right so our job is to

221
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,359
look at the notes secured this is this

222
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,390
is some documentation it's gonna be now

223
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,560
some casting for this for them so don't

224
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,399
don't say anything we can't take back

225
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,399
I'll make a map

226
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:14,789
it's a good map the here's what we know

227
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,259
about the the Lizard King he kills

228
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,389
people who displease him he's been the

229
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,100
ruler for 700 years the Shadow King

230
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,629
needs an heir and believes that the

231
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,278
Lizard King needs to provide him that

232
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:27,239
air is that correct indeed and in

233
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,818
exchange the shadow king will reveal to

234
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:32,850
the Lizard King the source of his ale

235
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:35,698
okay you can tell that from even beyond

236
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:41,730
anything else what afflicts the the

237
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:44,068
Lizard King is not a cold okay he looks

238
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,319
pretty dead this is keep this is

239
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:50,278
functionally speaking a mummy right that

240
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:52,889
is clinging to this Jam

241
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:56,338
sure and and again again you'll recall

242
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:58,289
that this gem is constantly sort of

243
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,749
bleeding and leaking this shadow-like

244
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:04,139
substance okay and then on your way into

245
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:07,079
this area you can see energy of this

246
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,850
kind flowing down from the ship right

247
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,668
this was the same energy that I

248
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,499
harnessed with Grandma man see ya to

249
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:15,178
open the vault door that was just a

250
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,939
shadow that was you manipulating might I

251
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:20,608
don't I think in accordance with your my

252
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:23,159
grandma your you're packing okay your

253
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:25,859
classic skills there this is something

254
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:28,379
else and as I said these whispers and

255
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:31,739
wisps of this energy come some is

256
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:35,220
collected in the gym and some is heaped

257
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:39,119
up to the right at his hand and they

258
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,489
appear to be wagering with this energy

259
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:46,379
okay while the intercessors have their

260
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:49,288
conversations okay does he think all

261
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:51,808
that same stuff absolutely he is his his

262
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:54,808
senses aren't as attuned to shadow sir

263
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:59,548
but he is perfectly capable of assessing

264
00:12:54,808 --> 00:13:02,730
it via you know arcane means okay I'd

265
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:06,418
like to speak to the halfling woman in

266
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,199
the cloak um and approach her I can't

267
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,578
make out her face

268
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:17,188
as I recall it's enshrouded in shadow

269
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:17,759
and I'd like to ask her what is the

270
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:21,230
process

271
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:24,750
that we need to follow in order to

272
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,370
secure this transaction how do we find

273
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,360
an heir for your shadow king were you

274
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:33,629
not informed of this process before you

275
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,860
accepted this task uh not exactly no

276
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:38,879
well they're a little light on

277
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:42,360
information and we've had it makes sense

278
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:46,289
to a certain extent we have lost five

279
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,940
today yeah so I imagine the time that

280
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:50,549
might historically have been spent

281
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,470
training them right you know assume we

282
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:53,759
received we've received no training that

283
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,190
seems relevant at all to this situation

284
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,539
and explain to me how we can make your I

285
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,480
just want to make your life easier I

286
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,909
don't want any approach if he has to

287
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,889
qualify actually yes throw men at the

288
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,769
problem right right yeah if you could

289
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,750
make it out you can tell the way that

290
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,699
the voice is modulated that she's

291
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,250
speaking through his smile okay she

292
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:18,650
rests her left hand on the pommel of

293
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:23,460
this sword and says here's the problem

294
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:26,879
we need an air you need information as I

295
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:31,860
suggested before any one of the lizard

296
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:35,159
Kings sons would be a perfectly apt tool

297
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,850
to be used in this situation okay we can

298
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:42,689
we can help them navigate the shadow sea

299
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:46,350
we can bring them into our realm we can

300
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,900
make certain that they are treated with

301
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,990
their with the correct deference and

302
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,819
they will help us to continue our line

303
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:59,399
in the world that we do it where do we

304
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:03,860
find the lizard king funds that the

305
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:08,039
lizard king stirs it's immediate it's

306
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,139
unpleasant to look at the the limbs sort

307
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,659
of Bend incorrectly like whatever is

308
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:16,110
holding them together is not what holds

309
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:18,500
together living things I've got limbs at

310
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,649
that dimension of the Suns

311
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:26,309
he's twists and like clutches even close

312
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:30,528
her own to the gym are his sons in that

313
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:34,729
gem I'm asking this of the halfling

314
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:36,269
when people speak to the Lizard King on

315
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,459
this issue

316
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,438
they are occasionally and when I see

317
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,948
occasionally I mean absolutely every

318
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:46,469
time curled into the sky got it yeah I

319
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:53,929
figured as much do you need do you need

320
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:56,278
time to commune with your power here

321
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:58,138
would you like to speak to the The

322
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,230
Lizard King and perhaps come to some

323
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,120
kind of arrangement yourselves well if

324
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,149
you're advising me there are three of

325
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,818
you here sure I mean he couldn't fling

326
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:12,089
you all at once I'm sure I'm attached to

327
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:14,669
these ones emotionally so I'd rather

328
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:25,699
none of us get flung is this audible -

329
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:29,128
yeah okay that that cuz this goes so

330
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:32,998
okay if we if we so much as mention his

331
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:34,769
size then he's gonna throw us so we have

332
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:36,209
to talk to him without mentioning the

333
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:40,039
fun somehow that would be my

334
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:45,808
recommendation okay great you're back

335
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:48,808
okay can you see that at this she leans

336
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:50,549
over in confidence to her Shadow King

337
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:54,600
okay

338
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:59,399
I would love to enlist your assistance

339
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:02,519
my mate yes um and yours share because I

340
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,068
know that you have a there's a there's a

341
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,578
soothing melody that you play that tends

342
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:10,048
to calm emotions and it does seem like

343
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:13,139
this is an emotional issue for the

344
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:18,648
Lizard King don't know a lot of lizard

345
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:21,600
folk songs I know a couple swampy ER

346
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:23,818
Tunes it's swampy is great

347
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,230
swampy sounds really nice swamp let's go

348
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:29,759
like that we'll go with that

349
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:32,730
can you potentially communicate with the

350
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,529
lizard king in a tongue that he would be

351
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,849
able to communicate back to you because

352
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:38,398
I don't think he's gonna talk to us I

353
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:41,398
think it's just gonna talk at us and

354
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:42,679
your voice you hear in your mind you

355
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:46,609
hear a voice

356
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:50,060
it says I am perfectly capable of your

357
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:51,829
speech intercessor oh I don't know that

358
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,230
I'd call myself an intercessor really

359
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:57,409
here is that an intermediary I'm a

360
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:01,849
mediator come here can we go with that I

361
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:04,730
am just here to settle this situation

362
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:07,730
because we need information

363
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:13,579
I have heard I've been sent down here

364
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:15,259
because your gem is under threat I have

365
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:17,659
heard that there are bandits in the

366
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:19,700
Horde that are here and so I was sent

367
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,400
down by security and I show like

368
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,370
whatever official yeah yeah I I I'm I'm

369
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,890
here to protect the gem so I'm just here

370
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:29,659
to make sure that nothing happens but it

371
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,020
seems like you might be exterminating

372
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:36,560
people so maybe we can settle this

373
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:42,170
squabble out because you are an outsider

374
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:45,319
I will reveal something that the other

375
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:49,820
intercessors did not know great I have

376
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:52,750
not sired a son for 200 years I see hey

377
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:55,970
raise your hand if you're in that Club

378
00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:02,990
sons I think I've sired a lot of them

379
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:07,460
and they're no picnic Julian probably

380
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:14,569
some lizard man the occasional yeah I

381
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:15,950
mean let's get busy let's make one so it

382
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:18,740
seems like you're kind of at an impasse

383
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,380
with this shadow king who needs an heir

384
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,230
from you but you don't have an heir is

385
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,170
that correct correct

386
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:29,120
okay under knows there's no circumstance

387
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,320
in which I can reveal that I have no

388
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:35,149
sons mmm oh so he doesn't know that you

389
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,369
are the only one that knows it okay and

390
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,450
the only reason you know it is because

391
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:44,899
no one would take you seriously why do

392
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,559
you have scales all right I got inner

393
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,560
strength

394
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:55,309
scales right on this heart either

395
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:58,400

00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:01,789
shingles yes the sames close he said he

397
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,420
says we need the information he has to

398
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:08,720
find out why the ritual no longer works

399
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:12,050
I have been resurrected every hundred

400
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,480
years without fail uh-huh for 700 years

401
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:18,470
right and I have led my people to

402
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,650
success sure the ritual no longer works

403
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,809

406
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,110
sacrificed before for this ritual

407
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:35,240
there's a new demand notice there's no

408
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:38,689
sacrifice oh the last 200 years I have

409
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,269

Shadow King needs an heir a son of this

416
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,970
Lizard King but he does not have any

sons will the Shadow King blow up a spa

418
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,220

419
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,900
yeah I don't care

420
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,900

424
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:35,539
shape of the Lizard King just sort of

425
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:37,939
wrap around it almost like a like IKEA

426
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:38,659
has a lamp like this it's like a wicker

427
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,539
orb

428
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:45,140
yeah oh yeah he just wraps himself in

429
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:47,740
around it and then pulls himself up onto

430
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:52,400
the table they're playing the game on

431
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:54,440
okay Dark Souls stuff yeah

432
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,360
this is nightmarish at this point now

433
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,509
hold on now hold on I didn't say this

434
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,309
for no reason is there something else

435
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:02,829
the shadow

436
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:07,990
King will accept in order to lift the

437
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:11,159
curse and continue the ritual the ritual

438
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:14,259
that we have not cursed

439
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,660
the Lizard King okay let's let me be

440
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:18,910
very clear about it's pretty cursed to

441
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:22,870
me but we are not the agents of this

442
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:25,060
curse okay there they're rich will no

443
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:28,239
longer functions okay why does why does

444
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:31,509
that why does why does that reflect upon

445
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,630
our kingdom it's a good question who who

446
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:39,940
cast the curse

447
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:42,070
ritual it is it we never tell our side

448
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,850
of the story first okay this is

449
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:51,700
something we learned from an ancient

450
00:22:44,849 --> 00:23:00,309
circle I'm familiar what's really that's

451
00:22:51,700 --> 00:23:03,420
a good move what else can you offer uh

452
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:13,539
what what does the Shadow King value

453
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:16,060
sons Sons my moons um we got uh we've

454
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:19,359
got sons how long do you need the son

455
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:22,119
force does the Sun go to in their realm

456
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:27,909
forever no who's this is she cost you

457
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:32,069
this that's interesting what's the what

458
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:38,920
are their duties entail we need to

459
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:42,939
expand our line in shadow I mean it

460
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:46,269
might not need to be permanent leave

461
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:48,519
being a shadow son only the worst in the

462
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:51,639
world hey kind of science sounds kind of

463
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,470
off okay but how but I was given to

464
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,380
understand that you had no sons

465
00:23:53,470 --> 00:24:00,930
and this wicker gym ball starts to roll

466
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:07,120
around on the table before calm down I

467
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:10,660

468
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,519
with sons and I'm certain that one of

469
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,308

right here this guy had a mom for a

474
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:37,059
while just curious about the how how

478
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:45,729
would five minutes an art plane it could

479
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,949
be like a like one you are well I need

480
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:56,769
to understand the contours of this this

481
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:58,690
air dumb lizard folk only not drow we

this ships crawling Lucas grab a lizard

485
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:18,339
guy off the deck anyway something um ok

486
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:22,929
I'm a dragon so you just you need a son

487
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:25,629
so a lizard lizard boy and you need him

488
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:26,769
now and then everything is gonna be good

489
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,940
here right

490
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:32,889
may I inquire this may be you tell me if

491
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,799
this isn't an appropriate question but

492
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:39,429
if we're to provide you with premium son

493
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,139
experience of best possible son we may

494
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:43,980
need to understand that such that we can

495
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:49,690
convince them is there anything about

496
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:52,779
being an errand that a given lizard male

497
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,890
you would find unpalatable such that you

498
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:55,569
haven't been able to find one at this

499
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:59,230
point is there something about this

500
00:25:55,569 --> 00:26:02,859
that's unappealing to royalty we need

501
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:07,779
the line not just any son then we needed

502
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:11,919
that line to refresh our own so you just

503
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:13,119
need a shot and pass off yeah I'll try

504
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,130

00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,469

there

548
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:14,678
you can see just like like crisscross

549
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,010
stripes of where you had to physically

550
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,778
restrain yes blue goth you can see that

551
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:27,849
you have let though you have rubbed off

552
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:29,528
this green paint and you can you can see

553
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:32,079
that just underneath it

554
00:28:29,528 --> 00:28:36,890
you didn't occur to you to look closely

555
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:41,809
before yeah there are black sores

556
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:44,750
and lumps underneath and so he doesn't

557
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:46,970
appear to be less spry hmm necessarily

558
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,579
but this is clearly something that he

559
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:52,160
doesn't want people to know conscious so

560
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:56,470
he immediately he immediately pulls up

561
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:59,029
the back of his leather cloak and

562
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,680
basically flees the scene you see him go

563
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:03,319
back to the table

564
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,150
like hunched low okay snaps a couple

565
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:08,779
times and his people come and this is

566
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:11,180
the strange thing to go with him and two

567
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:13,490
others that stood sort of Sentinel

568
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,250
looking away from the table shimmer and

569
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,960
disappear yeah

570
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,970
so you see you see the Moussa going up

571
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,710
the right staircase okay heading through

572
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,370
the golden doors perhaps to the high

573
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,700

all right sort of Stegosaurus things in

575
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:37,549
the back okay potentially towards his

576
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:40,940

00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:42,379

taken out of so specific skills that how

752
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:18,989
much are the the Lizard Men Fe palanquin

they have put on a set of finger cymbals

754
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:25,319
and they're sort of like cleaning them

755
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:28,058
together rhythmically presumably in the

756
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,259
in an attempt state take it dinar on two

757
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:34,528
to lure him yeah can we you don't feel

758
00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:37,599
necessarily very drawn to it you know

759
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:40,498

760
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,509

it's been wonderful but time to go no we

767
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:31,989
are I'm trying I'm trying very hard to

768
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:34,359
on my feet think of a way to do these

769
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:37,929
fools so what I think I want to happen

770
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:41,108
is that you get in that house get it you

771
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:44,380
get in that palanquin and um and then

772
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:47,619
like I'm gonna try to just switch around

773
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:50,170
to yak we build like a paper mache

774
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:53,469
version of you and swap it Indiana Jones

775
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:55,059
it are you asking me that this is not a

776
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:57,219
great thought-out plan what's the

777
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:58,929
downside here I get banished to a shadow

778
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:00,159
universe really hoping that you can like

779
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:02,139
contribute to this plan it's a

780
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:06,458
meaningful way we do have to another of

781
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:09,489
Jarama banished yeah yeah yeah thanks

782
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:12,219
man you know how much it eight tentacles

783
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:15,068
with some shadow is I kind of like a

784
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:19,509
lizard in our ape that is not gonna work

785
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:23,108
um I couldn't use yeah I have my

786
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:25,239
shooting well yeah but what is crazy

787
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:27,009
thought we just leave the gem alone

788
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,449
you just don't do it somewhere you're

789
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:30,579
here Wallace no yeah

790
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:31,719
how that's gonna get really mad oh well

791
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:33,219
that's a shame yeah I probably should

792
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:36,719
just be banished to shadows forever so

793
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:36,719
walnut just doesn't get slightly upset

794
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:46,759
yeah I want to while they're trying to

795
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:50,579
sort this out I want to go over to the

796
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,730
woman the bloke woman and ask her like

797
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:56,400
how are you able to describe the time

798
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:59,670
scale difference what what are we

799
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:04,200
discussing once he passes through the

800
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:06,900
portal and returns it will be as though

801
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:09,389
no time passed here for certain oh boy

802
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,610
yeah that's talking about for him pass

803
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:13,859
is there in the Shadow Realm how much

804
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:16,590
time will that be independent how long

805
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:19,140
they spend there oh I see doing spending

806
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:21,450
they're doing what you okay my guess is

807
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:24,710
you're gonna have to continue the line

808
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:27,989
so I think you're gonna need to clean

809
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:29,880
the Bona lizards yeah I think you're

810
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:31,919
gonna have to but Queen they're clean

811
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,800
yeah you're gonna make a shadow son

812
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,599
royal to yourself huh you're gonna have

813
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,130
a whole family in there that you didn't

814
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:39,719
get to just leave it come back so they

815
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,460
just get to abandon yeah yeah yeah

816
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,639
alright that's a good idea yeah this

817
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:47,220
sounds great

818
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:54,269
this is your first plan okay

819
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:58,349
this was option a here's my proposal you

820
00:42:54,269 --> 00:43:00,809
distract the intercessor halfling with

821
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:03,839
questions as you are so want to do sorry

822
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:07,099
and then I am going to cast

823
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:11,070
accommodation of darkness on you and

824
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:12,750
minor illusion in the litter in the

825
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:14,430
shape of dinar but what is it the help

826
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,860
does that confer you a create a whole

827
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:18,659
creature shape I create the sound of or

828
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,470
an image of an object within range it

829
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:21,629
lasts for the duration

830
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:23,159
that's it if a creature uses its action

831
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,570
to examine the sound or image the

832
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,789
creature can determine is an illusion

833
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,900
with a successful intelligence check but

834
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:29,880
they're not gonna be looking to close at

835
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,880
you because you're royalty and you don't

836
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,530
want them looking directly at you okay

837
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,760
yeah that's your last demands don't no

838
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,519
one the fear no one looked me in the

839
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,160
eyes peons okay yeah let's try this just

840
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,710
right all right that sounds good that

841
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,529
sounds like this is really very tight

842
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:49,670
yes

843
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:51,320
I know this darkness I'm gonna ant I've

844
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,329
met a game this why is it this King

845
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:58,690
giving us this much latitude we should

846
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:58,690
all be dead this is not working at all

847
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,460
you're distracting okay right

848
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,860
distraction duty is that it okay let's

849
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:11,510
try it before I was excusing the

850
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:13,280
attentions friends I wish to inform you

851
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,750
that my son is very precious to me he's

852
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,690
a sweet boy

853
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:19,909
it reminds me of how my own seed was

854
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:24,019
obliterated within that within that

855
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:25,879
royal Buras in which he was carried and

856
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:29,599
I had not treasure him as knowledge of

857
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:32,329
Mike worthlessness but so in his stead

858
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,659
Mary offer a series of different heirs

859
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:39,380
perhaps to please you and tantalize you

860
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:42,879
hurry quickly my children I will have a

861
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:47,630
cavalcade of Sons for these Royals men

862
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:55,940
she says you are an idiot I'm already in

863
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:57,890
process it can't be stopped so I create

864
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:02,150
so dancing lights is the first time I am

865
00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:14,299
out yeah I have raised 300 sons and

866
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:17,000
daughters agreed to legendary martial

867
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:20,030
prowess and every day of my life is

868
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:25,340
marked by their attempts to kill me none

869
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:27,680
have yet succeeded leave this place okay

870
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,370
probably want to leave well he doesn't

871
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,699
look impressed

872
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:33,500
I'll miss U's child every time you call

873
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:41,059
me your child I just like visibly

874
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:44,840
shudder just like this saying you're

875
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:46,159
even a little bit of a drunken boy so

876
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,680
you have you know undertaking your

877
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:52,099
process to disappear here you gotta sing

878
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:54,649
his line yeah so then I hug you I see

879
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:56,719
but okay but in the while she's berated

880
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:58,510
yeah exactly I have produced the the

881
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,730
glow man out of

882
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:03,460
but I've bothered to give it a tail and

883
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:09,820
it's just sort of cavorting like this

884
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:13,389
little asleep it's like a geocities like

885
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:15,100
all the 1998 website I have to think of

886
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:22,029
there's a page counter underneath the

887
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:26,110
shovel is that so

888
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:29,260
when the illusory dinar materializes

889
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:30,220
well I I have to scream yeah nobody oh

890
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,950
yeah

891
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:37,949
all right I'll do it my royal loins burn

892
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:40,809
hot and violent nobody look at me don't

893
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:41,710
I'll do it but so help me God no eye

894
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:57,699
contact

895
00:46:41,710 --> 00:47:02,079
and I make a big scene I'm gonna try

896
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:08,759
really hard I gotta go because I want to

897
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:12,000
kill just yet log into the air for this

898
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,790
okay so then I'm gonna try to cast as

899
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,559
closely together as I can

900
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:19,599
darkness on you illusory dinar in the

901
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:21,420
Linea palanquin yeah there's a stereo as

902
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,159
they pause yeah there is a pause right

903
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:27,940
he's just that great the cymbals is very

904
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:31,589
good the the cymbals are you know

905
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:37,380
withdrawn placed into the pouches and

906
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:39,610
when the lizard men raise the palanquin

907
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:46,690
the leader of them sets it back down

908
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:52,480
again and then he passes his hand over

909
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:56,019
the do it intelligence check its way to

910
00:47:52,480 --> 00:48:03,010
no way is no waste a slender it's fluffy

911
00:47:56,019 --> 00:48:06,480
he's not that slow hot-air dork right

912
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,480
now at the gym you work yeah

913
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:15,990
the into the inter censuses that's

914
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:21,670
enough

915
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:28,539
can you solve this problem or not it

916
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:29,440
would seem not willingly can i there's

917
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:34,088
also an option

918
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:38,650
can I offer an apology you creep back in

919
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:40,690
you're outside you and glow man come in

920
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:45,369
with glow man out yeah that's the way we

921
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:48,280
were informed that some levity was

922
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:52,930
required at this proceeding and clearly

923
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:54,760
that's not the case and had we known

924
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:57,338
that I wish we've been informed of that

925
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,650
first before we came in made a mockery

926
00:48:57,338 --> 00:49:02,380
of this proceeding just me we made asses

927
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:03,730
of ourselves this is clearly not I can't

928
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,760
believe it this is clearly not the venue

929
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:09,699
for art no I should see me I'm in

930
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:16,060
darkness yeah she she draws her sword

931
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:16,689
and the glow man seems to notice it

932
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:20,440
somehow

933
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:24,269
oh okay holds this little glowy handsome

934
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:29,230
the animation stops and he is just

935
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:31,300
annihilated tip-to-tail is cleaved as

936
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,940
soon as the sword comes out he's

937
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:37,060
reacting to this and then it's like a

938
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:42,670
magic trick like where a drape is drawn

939
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:46,809
off of a table yeah dinar is standing in

940
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:50,349

equivalent of that you know you have to

979
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:43,019
put exactly three gallons on the scale

980
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,970
yeah as the jugs yeah you're just trying

981
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:47,849
to three gallons of lizard's semen yeah

982
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:49,379
I'm here doing it I've seen die hard so

983
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:52,230
many times you think I'd be good at this

984
00:51:49,380 --> 00:52:00,030
no yeah I've got a gun taped in my back

985
00:51:52,230 --> 00:52:02,119
nice yeah the list of men are very

986
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:08,940
confused about their palanquin okay

987
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:12,210
guitar will do it for them being a raspy

988
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:14,519
voice scratching their frills dude do we

989
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,420
look heartbroken but yeah I mean they

990
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:19,630
thought they thought they had a good

991
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:21,789
thing going here now look they're gross

992
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:23,950
they're gross monsters just could

993
00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:24,789
improve think think of what you could do

994
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:26,379
for them

995
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:30,730
think of the lives you can improve just

00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:33,160
by being near them I'd say like shirley

is like dinar that's inner I mean I'm

998
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:38,500
not convinced this is what I think to do

999
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:40,659
either but because it's you going I

1000
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,409
think that you should be the one asking

1001
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:46,750
the questions to make that determination

1002
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:50,259

oh yeah and then the shadow king says

1088
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:29,219
that there is a force that has been

1089
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:32,340
unleashed on your world and as its

1090
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:35,669
source is far away from where you are

1091
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:39,930
physically but its power remains and it

1092
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:43,380
knows when a person has a piece of the

1093
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:47,119
grave in them and it makes that piece of

1094
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:49,980
the grave grow until they're consumed

1095
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,549
the old rituals will no longer serve you

1096
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:56,760

01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:33,539
that was wall that's what we needed to

1126
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,520
hear this guy's screw at the end if he

1127
01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:37,739

1129
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:41,250

01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:43,739
you were there and really oh yeah I knew

1131
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:46,900
that I'd have been like

1132
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:47,829
the his entourage the shadow Kings

1133
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:51,430
entourage

1134
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:55,659
sort of provides similar to splooge oz

1135
01:00:51,429 --> 01:00:58,089
provides a tactical cover for escape and

1136
01:00:55,659 --> 01:01:00,460
you can you can you can tell that for

1137
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:02,740
the Shadow King is it's not it isn't a

1138
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:06,690
small thing there's some reflection of

1139
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:11,519
him in this decrepit mummified creature

1140
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:13,720
you know and the culture that he had

1141
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:17,650
that culture that served him for seven

1142
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:21,099
hundred years that has that has now come

1143
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:25,289
to something of an end so as I've said

1144
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:28,389
they are pulling themselves back and the

1145
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:34,690
the halfling woman just watches you for

1146
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:39,279
a while she's the last to leave and you

1147
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:42,579
can tell you can tell as she turns

1148
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,910
toward you you can feel the staff of the

1149
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:47,880
master almost like pushing against your

1150
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:51,449
back hmm

1151
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:54,309
like it is it has some kind of impetus

1152
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:54,969
okay it's nothing it's nothing you can't

1153
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:58,719
handle

1154
01:01:54,969 --> 01:02:03,519
sure but it it is responding to

1155
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:06,368
something okay I take it off of my back

1156
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,090
but I hold it not in not another attack

1157
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:11,769
spinning that pathway yeah and I I just

1158
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:14,980
make eye contact or what I think is eye

1159
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:16,780
contact with your shadowy face and I

1160
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:23,619
don't say anything but I hold the staff

1161
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:28,630
out yeah she says it's not time I have

1162
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:33,130
no quarrel with you in time we could

1163
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:37,900
even become friends but this sword and

1164
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:40,539
that staff hate each other mmm I see all

1165
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:44,650
right I put it away yeah I put it back I

1166
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:46,980
have a lot of respect for that sword who

1167
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,980
are you

1168
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:57,289
not clear you'll have to forgive me this

1169
01:02:53,510 --> 01:03:02,140
is my first time encountering the shadow

1170
01:02:57,289 --> 01:03:05,539
selves but she pulls the cloak back and

1171
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:09,009
to anyone else's perspective it looks

1172
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:13,130
like rosy be stinger different scars a

1173
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:16,760
different life lived but to you it is

1174
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:19,099
just a mass of warping shifting shapes

1175
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,560
there's something of there's something

1176
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:24,259
it isn't like a mirror there is

1177
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:27,320
something opaque about her like this is

1178
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:29,710
a part of you that you don't know and it

1179
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:37,309
is it is not pleasant

1180
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:39,349

1184
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,889
the shadow or what they call the path

music is is clearly reaching its

1201
01:04:41,719 --> 01:04:46,879
crescendo as we're moving into the end

1202
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:49,759
of the performance people have stopped

1203
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,220
doing what they're doing it is it has

1204
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:56,720
ceased to be a casino and is now almost

1205
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:58,189
entirely devoted to a kind of worship a

1206
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:03,069
worship that you understand quite well

1207
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:03,070
um halfway through

1208
01:05:03,338 --> 01:05:11,358
just this this blooming crescendo at the

1209
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:15,739
end she pulls her hand off of the

1210
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:23,269
strings and like it starts to shake her

1211
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:25,848
hand okay that but that's yeah yeah yeah

1212
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:28,548
like like and you can see that her face

1213
01:05:25,849 --> 01:05:37,338
is pained with it hmm you can't get a

1214
01:05:28,548 --> 01:05:39,739

1220
01:05:53,088 --> 01:05:58,940
from an emerald to a ruby stone mm-hmm

1221
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:00,379
and so she is she is like shaking her

touches it so at this point I will um I

1227
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:18,528
see that she's in pain and I see the

1228
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:20,298
crowd is still in the moment where

1229
01:06:18,528 --> 01:06:21,619

1236
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:40,129
to use that as cover to pull a

1237
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:47,239
switcheroo with her and get her offstage

1238
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:48,470

summon from that wild part of yourself

1246
01:07:05,449 --> 01:07:10,608
and then immediately out of every

1247
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:13,429
documents or bag it's just like 20 doves

pulls off the ring and throws it on the

1256
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:40,099
ground and then looks over at you for a

1257
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:43,789
second and then steps back through the

1258
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:44,630
teleportation circle so when the doves

1259
01:07:43,789 --> 01:07:47,269

01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:02,179
anything else that's happening out well

1264
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:05,750
runs and like unceremoniously jumps on

1265
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:10,009
the teleportation circle hmm she does

1266
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:11,929
again she's making that sound and then

1267
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:15,380
at this point she realizes what's

1268
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:17,028
happening and she's like in a panic and

1269
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:21,710
she's just slamming her foot over and

1270
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:23,260
over and over but no one's mellow mellow

1271
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:27,319
for rushes the stage

1272
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:29,239
um do I see the ring yeah uh it's just

1273
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:31,430
it's situated situated just right there

1274
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:33,199
on the right there in the circle um I

1275
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:35,810

1276
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:40,189

you can get you you pick it up fast

1280
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:52,689
enough and then we're able to get into

1281
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:56,359
it as a pouch great and then I um

1282
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:58,039
do that thing where you will see if I

1283
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:00,500
get this fart but you ever do that thing

1284
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:02,479
where you don't know where you're going

1285
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,939
you just need to go and while it just

1286
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:06,949
continued a promotion yeah like I need

1287
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:09,169
to get away from this situation and if I

1288
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:11,329
stop moving for even a second I will die

1289
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:11,810
but if it contained yeah or any have to

1290
01:09:11,329 --> 01:09:16,278
contain this

1291
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:18,289
so she'll leave the stage and then look

1292
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:22,220
like she's gonna patrol whatever but

1293
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:24,409
yeah it's just complete ignoring vision

1294
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:27,199
and heading up the the stairs at like

1295
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:29,599
back to where they like where the the

1296
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:32,840
high-roller Suites had been yes

1297
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:35,090
the golden doors yeah absolutely so you

1298
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,350
you you were able to put all this that

1299
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:38,150
you're trying to put this situation

1300
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,750
behind you you have it completely under

1301
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:41,839
control

1302
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:44,930
you have you have erected a version of

1303
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:47,630
yourself that can manage this situation

1304
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:49,880
obviously not disappointed now you know

1305
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:56,930
what I mean these things happen

1306
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:59,659
so as you the the sort of skeletal

1307
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:01,610
serpent just has a lot of questions as

1308
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:04,069
soon as your splishing your way back out

1309
01:10:01,609 --> 01:10:07,609
we're holding this gem that we won

1310
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:09,469
you cannot get the gym why not I don't

1311
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:12,889
know why he was in it you ever thought

1312
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:13,820
withdraw the gem from him what is that

1313
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:20,600
is that what's happening if you want to

1314
01:10:13,819 --> 01:10:23,479
try to get it what I think we held up

1315
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,800
our end of the deal I just assume we got

1316
01:10:23,479 --> 01:10:26,709
the gym out of that I think it was a

1317
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,239
theft it was supposed to perform not a

1318
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:34,670
reaction of it this wasn't hashed out

1319
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:36,319
before I got here you're casting your

1320
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:52,550
mind back like you don't know how many

1321
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:54,799

a transaction to help you in order to

1412
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:30,420
get that gem you didn't get the answer

1413
01:15:27,779 --> 01:15:34,019
that you liked but that's not my problem

1414
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:36,960
my problem is that gem and you're gonna

1415
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:39,390
hold up your end of the bargain or this

1416
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,100
guy is gonna make you into dusty

1417
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:45,360
sandwiches and then we're gonna eat them

01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:50,190
so what do you think about that what

1419
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:52,619
bargain around a little bit the whole

01:15:54,359 --> 01:16:01,289
bad thief here we we were sent to steal

1423
01:15:58,949 --> 01:16:02,760
this gem that you have apparently

1424
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:05,840
there's some miscommunication

1425
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:10,619
and they believe that it belongs to them

1426
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:14,730
my question to you is is this an

1427
01:16:10,619 --> 01:16:20,069
existence you desire what this this this

1428
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:22,889
resurrection end and oblivion does it

1429
01:16:20,069 --> 01:16:25,519
please you I I'm in that genuine even if

1430
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:31,230
I wanted it to

1431
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:34,860
it's so nice to talk to someone calm for

1432
01:16:31,229 --> 01:16:37,289
a change even if I wanted to I couldn't

1433
01:16:34,859 --> 01:16:39,859
maintain it there's some force that is

1434
01:16:37,289 --> 01:16:46,010
keeping the resurrection from occurring

1435
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:55,399
but I long now but I long for now is to

1436
01:16:46,010 --> 01:17:09,890
rescind the crown and see new places hmm

1437
01:16:55,399 --> 01:17:09,889

1451
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:58,229

01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,060
here looking for us

1456
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:08,520
and you're probably safer up there

1457
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:09,420
anyway get up there and play your songs

1458
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:12,570
fine

1459
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:15,390
yeah you see you see Cher look back look

1460
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:16,469
around the room walk over see hasar

1461
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:18,300
reaches up

1462
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:21,360
and she's like it's just gonna be a

1463
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:26,100
thing and he's like no no no it's fine

1464
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:29,339
it seems like you're friends so she she

1465
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:37,010
peels her way out goes back through the

1466
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:39,180
vault okay he says let's try let's do it

1467
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:41,250
in order to do that we'll have to get

1468
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:45,659
past oh sorry

1469
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:48,149
he says he's in your service he's the

1470
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:54,840
boss I he was asking if you know he's a

1471
01:18:48,149 --> 01:18:56,789
particle about I thought that when

1472
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,539
hussar died that would be the end of it

1473
01:18:56,789 --> 01:19:02,939
I was wrong

1474
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:05,640
see is he being held back from that in

1475
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:09,869
the same way that you are I don't know

1476
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:12,630
what his problem is there's no way to

1477
01:19:09,869 --> 01:19:14,430
like him enough there's no way to like

1478
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:19,199
him as much as he needs me to like him

1479
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:26,550
oh poor guy I'd say that's a shame but I

1480
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:31,349
feel a little closer kinship right so he

1481
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:35,279
he he sort of dismantled himself falls

1482
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:41,220
down off of the chair not crawls over

1483
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:44,909
and then rolls up for easy storage yeah

1484
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:47,310
perfect easy yeah he crawls up

1485
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:50,939
underneath your cloak and sort of wraps

1486
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:55,020

1550
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,460
of different scenarios in which they

1553
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:37,820
especially when you pass a lizard

1554
01:23:35,448 --> 01:23:41,000
lizard' folk guard there's a little

1555
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:47,630

say like I wanted it like it and alive I

1560
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:59,090
think it's such an open net but after

1561
01:23:55,069 --> 01:24:01,789
they come back and they have whatever I

1562
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:07,340
see them I see Rosie and I want to walk

1563
01:24:01,789 --> 01:24:09,109
up to her and her face is like clearly

1564
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:11,750
like she looks like she's a mess like

1565
01:24:09,109 --> 01:24:14,000
sand and it looks like she's been in a

1566
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:15,170
fight like like she's been punching

1567
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,090
something like her knuckles are all

1568
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:20,149
bloody and she just comes up to you and

1569
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:21,679
she goes like where were you we were

1570
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:23,149

1571
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:24,590

1572
01:24:23,149 --> 01:24:26,179
supposed to be part of a team we're a

1573
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:28,100
team we're gonna stick together and it's

1574
01:24:26,179 --> 01:24:29,719
just puffs off and then I would assume

1575
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,489

1576
01:24:29,719 --> 01:24:34,810

walnut done grass is having to ride back

1697
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:18,389
in a cart for about a day and a half she

1698
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:21,420
is on the top they let you do that oh no

1699
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:24,240
they're gonna do whatever she wants um

1700
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:25,890
it's not really designed for it oh no no

1701
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:27,569
this isn't gonna keep you from doing it

1702
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:29,850
it's gonna make her do it even more I'm

1703
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:32,729
sure go ahead it has it has sort of a

1704
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:35,370
more of a convex sort of surface that

1705
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:36,389
water can roll along okay but this is

1706
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:37,800
this is where she does her thing

1707
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:39,090
yes she's like on it and it's like

1708
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,560
arching her back it's always the wrong

1709
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:42,060
it's always the wrong shape a little too

1710
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,180
much and she's just like completely

1711
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:48,920
sitting there and to the untrained eye

1712
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:52,950
it looks as though she has not moved

1713
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:56,010
I can I I'm gonna give the I don't know

1714
01:30:52,949 --> 01:30:58,500
who's driving give it up it's just

1715
01:30:56,010 --> 01:31:01,530
functionaries of the organisation okay

1716
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:03,689
I'm gonna flip up there after about half

1717
01:31:01,529 --> 01:31:06,469
a day because we haven't talked in a

1718
01:31:03,689 --> 01:31:09,839
little while I know you're angry with me

1719
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:14,340
but I pop a Crouch next to you and your

1720
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:15,539
weird splayed out pose and I'm not gonna

1721
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:18,329
say anything I don't say anything for a

1722
01:31:15,539 --> 01:31:20,100
while we kind of just ride along and I

1723
01:31:18,329 --> 01:31:27,659
know you know I'm there

1724
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:28,910
but eventually I ask you did she hurt

1725
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:31,800
you

1726
01:31:28,909 --> 01:31:33,479
well that is just looking up at the sky

1727
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,770
she like refuses to make eye contact

1728
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:39,599
it's like she's not even acknowledging

1729
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:41,840
that you're there and I'm like I'm

1730
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,160
starting to stop a couple times and then

1731
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:47,760
you can see she's like really fighting

1732
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:52,260
it it's like just like her eyes are

1733
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:54,659
getting glassy and she rolls over and

1734
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:57,480
just buries her head in your knee and

1735
01:31:54,659 --> 01:31:59,239
just lets out what sounds like the

1736
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:03,779
weight of just like a thousand sighs

1737
01:31:59,239 --> 01:32:07,559
mm-hmm just pay a high psi yeah just yep

1738
01:32:03,779 --> 01:32:10,769
I guess sign and I got we got I got my

1739
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:12,570
little halfling arms and cut your hair

1740
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:13,020
and I don't I don't ask any more

1741
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:18,119
questions

1742
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:22,970
we ride like that together yeah when you

1743
01:32:18,119 --> 01:32:24,869
get back to when you get back up to the

1744
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:27,270
barge right docks

1745
01:32:24,869 --> 01:32:29,309
just a little bit east of the barge

1746
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:30,600
right in as you might recall right from

1747
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:34,880
from the previous part of the trip you

1748
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:38,430
can see that coriander has almost

1749
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:41,940
collapsed in size Oh huh

1750
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:43,650
so when so for whatever distance you

1751
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:44,729
whatever amount of time you've been away

1752
01:32:43,649 --> 01:32:49,229
this is as long as you've been away from

1753
01:32:44,729 --> 01:32:51,809
coriander since the conversion but

1754
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:55,679
typically you can sort of see the vine

1755
01:32:51,810 --> 01:33:00,600
and bark sinews between the plates and

1756
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:02,610
then when you come back to the place you

1757
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:05,340
can see that the sinews are not visible

1758
01:33:02,609 --> 01:33:07,109
at all it's almost like compacted so

1759
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:09,869
there's no pengie yes yeah exactly so

1760
01:33:07,109 --> 01:33:12,089
there's no there's no access to the

1761
01:33:09,869 --> 01:33:13,890
interior parts I think we should know

1762
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:16,560
what are you and you can tell you can

1763
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:20,039
tell that someone has tried to has tried

1764
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:22,650
to do something to coriander like either

1765
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:25,800
steal the cards or to steal this

1766
01:33:22,649 --> 01:33:28,170
creature I thought and your suspicion is

1767
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:32,010
that they were not successful yeah at

1768
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:33,659
your approach you can see you can see

1769
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:37,289
coriander sort of expand and you can

1770
01:33:33,659 --> 01:33:40,739
hear the vines internal to her structure

1771
01:33:37,289 --> 01:33:41,939
stretch haha and she whinnies and sniffs

1772
01:33:40,739 --> 01:33:45,899
at your creepers

1773
01:33:41,939 --> 01:33:47,339
I I don't think I have much yeah we got

1774
01:33:45,899 --> 01:33:49,349
the wizard Kurt with aliens we got the

1775
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:50,850
gimmies oh yeah oh they oh yeah yeah I

1776
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:54,449
don't care about this medallion I'm just

1777
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:55,980
gonna give that whole thing yeah I feed

1778
01:33:54,448 --> 01:33:57,869
my whole medallion was like this was

1779
01:33:55,979 --> 01:34:02,789
done you're just like an apple like

1780
01:33:57,869 --> 01:34:04,469
multiple bites like yeah yeah and then

1781
01:34:02,789 --> 01:34:06,539
just eaten it serve like and eventually

1782
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:09,569
that you know just start have fun with

1783
01:34:06,539 --> 01:34:12,238
it yeah just the nibbles all around the

1784
01:34:09,569 --> 01:34:14,340
edge and then just BAM right through it

1785
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,138
right through the clasp that holds it

1786
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:19,170
onto the ribbon yeah

1787
01:34:16,139 --> 01:34:21,630
just a few more thoughtful choose shakes

1788
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:28,170
it out and she's ready for the trip home

1789

you like you haven't said much I'm

1867
01:38:25,789 --> 01:38:28,880

up on what's happened since you left but

1870
01:38:30,859 --> 01:38:35,630
it was only like a fraction of a second

1871

every facet of this purple gem you can

1876
01:38:49,219 --> 01:38:55,760
as though it like an animated series of

1877
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:58,610
