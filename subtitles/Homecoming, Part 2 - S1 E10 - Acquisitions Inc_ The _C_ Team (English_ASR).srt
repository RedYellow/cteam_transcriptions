00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
time at the enemies the past threatens

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,819
the fastest whether you were to make

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,740
attacks to second and then the question

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,449
play it flash and records to choose a

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,179
course in solution you thought was

6
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:14,548
prudent in any step of [ __ ] Krypton

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,859
will become the future it's that well

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,300
that I pursue in no mountain to Steve

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,550
but dungeon to deem them expendable

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,890
marks up to the top of the peak of

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,689
beneath maybe they come like sharks you

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,820
wait while I swim in that line again by

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,609
parts included they regret for a cleric

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,890
confessor that did the lessons like a

18
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,659
contending professor but if you speak in

grass 100% right in the middle of it

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,740
ball all night a well not a heavy arc

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,140
hmm by the end of this arc you will be

36
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,239
exhausted by walnut on grass laying with

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,728
walnut you you will say this is enough

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:43,109
hmm not for long I turned down the nut

39
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,709
mmm developing an allergy exactly to my

40
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:45,688
left

Arcade

46
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,509
we also have a organization called

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,399
child's play whose purpose

48
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:10,439
oh yeah it's a bomb whose purpose is to

49
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,379
put games and toys in hospitals and

50
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,389
domestic violence shelters

51
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,349
where hopefully they can make those

52
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:21,169
scary places a little bit less scary to

53
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:24,139
that end we actually auctioned off a

54
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:26,000
seat at the table for what was then a

55
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:30,949
completely unnamed unannounced project

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,939
that became the seating so it is my

57
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:38,179
great pleasure to introduce Devine the

58
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:40,430
teasing sorcerer here with us today

59
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,200
do you reckon with its rifling that's

60
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,430
right yeah at a fling that there's no

61
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:49,459
foreshadowing there and we also have

62
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,920
Chris drought this time who was also

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,480
plays Dungeons and Dragons with us

64
00:02:50,919 --> 00:03:01,750
basically I go actually my over here

65
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:04,129
yeah yeah yeah here four point seven

66
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,699
it's right it's all right that's why

67
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,000
won't Robin

68
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:09,859
I'll probably get all the way there so

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,199
let's see snow when last we saw our

70
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:18,380
heroes they had returned to the site of

71
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:22,729
the burrowing creature that they came to

72
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:26,419
know as the wandering crypt deeply tied

73
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:29,329
in with the CEO of acquisitions

74
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:32,569
incorporated in some way it's sort of

75
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:37,280
his white whale apparently he has sought

76
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:38,419
it and failed to capture it failed to

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,129
destroy it and it

78
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,569
we don't 100% understand all of that

79
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,349
maybe that's what this entire campaign

80
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:49,129
is about Lou knows is over the other

81
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:55,099
having happy not having returned to the

82
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:58,549
cavern prepared ready to you know

83
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:00,500
discover its deeper mysteries they

84
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:04,010
learned that the wandering crypt

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:08,659
had wondered and as I wanted indeed

86
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:10,009
indeed and as a result I mean yeah I get

87
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:17,529
it you got it

88
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:20,389
yes in the deep it strange trails and

89
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:25,719
glassing is though from heat and bizarre

90
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,719
creatures simply left behind in its wake

91
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:35,020
created a truly strange and alien

92
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:38,620
environment up to and including a series

93
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:41,500
of symbols that it is sort of edged in

94
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:44,530
the wall symbols that sort of sit

95
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,589
halfway in the depth of the glass on the

96
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:50,109
stone some symbols we recognize for

97
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:53,679
example the symbol of Carthoris Travis

98
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:56,500
patron the herb which we had seen inside

99
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,319
the creature itself but there was also

100
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,170
another symbol this piece of [ __ ] I've

101
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,409
been thinking about so there was another

102
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:12,400
symbol indeed the symbol of MELAS who

103
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:16,380
has a gruesome reputation in walnuts

104
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:19,599
order by the Enclave packs anima it is a

105
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,930
unrideable symbol children learn about

106
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,169
it

107
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,990
so that they can destroy whatever they

108
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:29,289
see it on and if its entire purpose it

109
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:32,620
is it is the literal icon and symbol of

110
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:40,270
the enemy a betrayer so in the ancient

111
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:44,649
history of the EPA Maliki and maelys

112
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:47,709
both held sway over a vast forest that

113
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:52,179
in the lore of the EPA once covered the

114
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:55,029
whole of the planet now that region is

115
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,939
to be like that it sounds 400 let's

116
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:04,569
bring it back to that one city at a time

117
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:07,478
so now the place where that power is

118
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:09,329
greatest is a region south of the sword

119
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:14,560
mountains called the crypt garden forest

120
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:18,159
still wooded but the power of the EPA

121
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,918
has waxed and it is waxed steadily ever

122
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,040
since this schism between Maliki and

123
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:26,500
bailiff bailiff ceased answering prayers

124
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,950
and became known as Mela the betrayers

125
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,589
so that is the situation we find

126
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:34,269
ourselves in you have laid your eyes

127
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:40,149
upon this

128
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:43,629
this icon of of hate and loathing here

129
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:46,359
in the here in the guts of this cavern

130
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:50,668
where these symbols are continuing to

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:56,410
Sparkle the ten tacular spectacular

132
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:58,959
unleashed by kethry strobe if it's it's

133
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,410
rays that he used to destroy the

134
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:06,129
creature of now withdrawn as though you

135
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,689
know like so many power cords on vacuums

136
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:10,538
maybe that's not the appropriate

137
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:13,180
metaphor no I like a did a weapon in the

138
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:14,649
face guys go to go they on variated

139
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,459
there it's several of them already went

140
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:18,638
through it that's true

141
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:22,269
no they go imagine right mission yeah

142
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,189
yeah yeah no no hit the button katrell

143
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:28,658
is cut at a three thousand pieces

144
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:31,360
wow you got some Devine just go ahead

145
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:34,000
and stretch I check in my space if you

146
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,800
take Michael it's a good one yeah enjoy

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,468
it thank you all sending three thousand

148
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,449
pieces because I take it back together

149
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:42,098
oh yeah anything right yeah I guess so

150
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:47,889
yeah yeah definitely don't you take the

151
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:48,250
bed that's the deepest irony um I'm

152
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,740
ready

153
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,569
yeah exactly so that's abuse this symbol

154
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,519
that should never be written a single

155
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:59,769
time is written by your guests at least

156
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,810
a hundred times a lot of time and

157
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:06,038
there's no way to get it out it's

158
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:08,709
literally suffused even in the glass I

159
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:12,009
mean it would take what what you are

160
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:15,668
required to do is not possible which is

161
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,750
to destroy it absolutely something to

162
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:18,758
challenge yeah I'm ready

163
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:23,259
yeah start talking about this air form

164
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:26,400
so I immediately freeze when trying to

165
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:29,860
like suppress what I'm feeling right now

166
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,228
because one I know that I'm supposed to

167
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,550
get rid of it and two

168
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:37,389
this is definitely the type of thing

169
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:40,389
that I would document but I'm not going

170
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:46,360
to why not why not Amy

171
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:48,159
I mean walnut is dammit um yeah I can't

172
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,620
I so I don't reach from

173
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:56,500
I think it's unreadable and I okay so

174
00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:00,068
please okay that's what I don't say

175
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,078
anything to the party I also purposely

176
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:04,448
look away from as many of them as

177
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:05,828
possible and just fix my gaze down the

178
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:09,128
tunnel and just try and give everyone a

179
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:10,929
like okay let's let's move along um but

180
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,430
you know you guys might be able to see

181
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:15,489
that woman it's like stiffened a little

182
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:18,309
bit if you were everywhere you look

183
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,789
every every place every every place like

184
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:24,818
every like psychic lilly pad you try to

185
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:26,559
find in your visual field eventually you

186
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:29,469
discover it you don't know if they're

187
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:32,049
moving through the glass every place

188
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,579
your eyes rest you start to see it and

189
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:38,979
so you are you are basically trying to

190
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:43,149
find a place a darker place where this

191
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:51,360
is not visible and you come across you

192
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:55,389
come across a heap of shredded wheat

193
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,730
armour-wood if it looks like in that if

194
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:03,068
it matters pump well you imagine imagine

195
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:04,930
if a crow we're very very large think

196
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:07,120
about all the time yes imagine this

197
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,278
imagine the type she's kidding imagine

198
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,429
the type of net that it would create

199
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:16,539
okay so deceptively small nest is

200
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:20,769
actually very its Janice it is robust

201
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:25,360
and in fact there is there is there's a

202
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:28,810
couple eggs in this nest mmm jet-black

203
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,438
eggs and there are also eggs there's

204
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:35,318
also smaller versions of this nest sort

205
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:38,769
of scraped out of the walls the deeper

206
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:42,129
in you get so not obviously not regular

207
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,539
in terms of they're like a distance from

208
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:47,799
each other anyway I mean this is very

209
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:49,838
very natural you know an animal behavior

210
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,539
and so there's clutches and eggs all

211
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:57,000
around but in the nest that is here at

212
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:59,099
the base there is actually a person

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,879
inside this

214
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,870
asked who's whose robes have been

215
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,929
bloodied but you can see that there

216
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:12,000
their chest is still rising and falling

217
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:17,879

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,300
own free will and encountered something

305
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:15,740
and now you are in a nest

306
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:21,379

rush of wind from deeper in the cave

315
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:57,800
blow past the party mm-hmm well I think

316
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:00,919
of it it smells good to me I tend to buy

317
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,509
that like a well previously everything

318
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,839
everything else that you've experienced

319
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:08,419
has been some bizarre new construction

320
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,170
you know what I mean is it like freshly

321
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:15,490
freshly clawed stone the creature that

322
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:19,159
it deposits apparently weird symbols

323
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:21,830
this this smells like the type of deeps

324
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:25,069
that you're familiar with okay okay this

325
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,990
is this is coming from way down this all

326
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,700
there's a million scenarios you can

327
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,240
think of for this that's probably like

328
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,430
20 words there's like 20 drow words for

329
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,149
the weirdest damn underground bandwidth

330
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:39,919
Grove least yeah surely yeah super game

331
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:42,559
the moisture is this there's different

332
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,209
accents and moisture you can employ into

333
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,649
the defense and you want a lot of

334
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:52,730
exclamation points yeah like Danny I'll

00:19:52,420 --> 00:20:03,490
can see at first at first glance it's

390
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:09,250
probably ten eyes but it could be 12 so

391
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:10,660

00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:37,539
lacking in fireballs as you would think

400
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,830
of our magic hurt anyway we would yeah

401
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:41,470
in exchange in exchange for your

402
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:43,210
services in what we I find I'm assuming

403
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,650
change these eyes that are in front of

404
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,250

okay help us anyway but probably jump

410
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,120
into this we have to figure out what

411
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,579
this thing is a lot of stuff from the

412
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:09,699
Underdark is dangerous it gets a bad rap

413
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:15,369
it's just like primarily dangerous like

414
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:17,259
94% 6% good or okay until you fish it

415
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,879
off but I want to figure out what this

416
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:21,190
thing is have I seen it before so all

417
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,630
that good look I'm on board with this I

418
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,990
feel like we kill too many things we run

419
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:29,620
into I don't know I become the moral

420
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:31,420
calm I feel like the ratios [ __ ] yeah

421
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:34,750
forgive me there would this be a nature

422
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,340
I mean for my knowledge are you what I

423
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:40,180
am honored I would I would take it I

424
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:42,939
would take nature or history nor nor

425
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,830
tree and a major leadership in will

426
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,460
church I don't know word plan there that

427
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:51,220
will be asking to be a 13 yes

428
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,079
if you've seen it you think you've seen

429
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,298
something with this particular eye

430
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,259
configuration before but you don't have

431
00:21:55,298 --> 00:22:01,329
to think about it long

432
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:05,110
I take cousin because just a word fired

433
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:08,230

434
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:10,689
see them blinking in some regular

435
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:14,919
pattern so it's not a bunch of whoa like

yes party that was a 14 I'm gonna roll

544
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:17,169
again that was a 5 so I guess a 14 which

545
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:19,269
didn't really do anything insane

546
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,850
everyone I guess I'm not that convincing

547
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:30,220
okay you for your throat in the music

548
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:34,599
plays okay so I go on I would let them

549
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:36,250
pass you shall not and then I go Enix in

550
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,959
exchange for something what could you

551
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,720
want and then I look at Rosie and I'm

552
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,100
like but that may be hocus-pocus a

553
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,650
second oh yeah I'm ready

554
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:48,329
don't that story yes it's continuing to

555
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:54,269
advance now it is sort of exerted itself

556
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:56,859
here near the nest and you have I assume

557
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:59,650
vacated that particular location

558
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:03,399
absolutely yeah yeah um it's rubbing its

559
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:07,810
beak in a kind of madness against the

560
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:11,890
size of the eggs in fact it in fact it

561
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:14,829
is closed its beak around an egg there's

562
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:17,200
a sort of wide serration internal to the

563
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:20,379
beak and you can you can see that it

564
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,330
just sort of adjusting them moving the

565
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,840
eggs around scooting them around inside

566
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:26,859
the Nascars think all over Hey yeah so

567
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,299
you would let them go because you

568
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:30,339
wouldn't want them to hurt any eggs

569
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:33,039
while they're scared trying to run from

570
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:35,079
you because you're so impressive if you

571
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:39,339
a shame if they you know in their fear

572
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:41,980
of thrashing around kill a bunch of x8 I

573
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:44,259
like start see from experience here is

574
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,349
an egg manisha jith it sets yeah yeah

575
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:49,990

their way from their eggs they will be

579

so hungry I'm amazing

580
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:08,859
cool I love nothing about this um she's

581
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:12,339

yolk is will high content good marriage

583
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:15,639
equipment but based on what protein but

584
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,400
they actually had probably like two to

585
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,610
three days ago you didn't understand so

586
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:24,250
we'll say that I related to all of you

587
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:27,519
we you know nothing about deep growth

588
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:29,319
that true I I feel like I've seen it

589
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,690
before but I think I've seen anything

590
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:33,819
lies and we dark I mean it is the kind

591
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,740
of thing you perhaps roll for and find

592
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:37,839
out how I try you know oh I wanted to

593
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,870
see if I could see them at the very best

594
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,000
I've seen boy what I wanted this how

595
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,369
about I try I am yeah now that he knows

596
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,680
what it is cannoli history uh rubber

597
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:48,879
crow can I do a survival check to see if

598
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,830
I know what the natural enemy of the

599
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,150
deep crow is an initial plan to the

600
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:54,909
night I'm doing it if you fail it and

601
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:57,370
doing a history on it okay yeah okay I'm

602
00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:00,670
going to take advantage nice I'm knowing

603
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:03,879
what the natural enemy of rock okay so

604
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:06,640
that it was seventeen and then one more

605
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,310
time that is not good seventeen do I

606
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:15,100
know what is natural and Miss OH these

607
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:18,819
subterranean birds tend to they tend to

608
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:22,389
frequent the larger caverns they don't

609
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:24,339
leave the deep very often okay right so

610
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,820
they're not they're not proponents of

611
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:31,529
the light are we speaking yes okay um so

612
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:34,089
creatures that emit a lot of light okay

613
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:36,190
one of one of their most hated creatures

614
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:40,899
in sort of the middle places that they

615
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:45,610
like as a Remer as which is a kind of a

616
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,620
kind of evil plaited worm with

617
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:49,990
incredible heat and light the only kind

618
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:55,989
the attaches to the bottom of that shark

619
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:57,700
has as I remember hmm a short time okay

620
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,559
so I leaned over to Rosie and I go I

621
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:03,100
don't where they can use can you make

622
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,289
any light yeah so you can do a dancing

623
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:07,500
lights or ferry fire if if you want to

624
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:10,690
in life and fireball and clean again

625
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,190
forget fireball I can also do nitrogen

626
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,269
and we have fireballs I imagined a minor

627
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,279
relations well okay

628
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:17,740
yeah fireballs might be nice that's a

629
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,000
little bit of an offensive act let's try

630
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,829
this more we're gonna let's do an

631
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,519
illusion and then we're gonna light it

632
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:27,549
up nice and I know another thing to

633
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:29,379
notice Alicia's who's gonna pass it you

634
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:32,799
know do that data for ya okay daddy um

635
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,180
and so I said okay on the count of three

636
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,849
and you know a lot of light

637
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,670
and then I want to say simultaneously I

638
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:44,289
use druid craft to make the sound that I

639
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:46,870
know to be a rumor as here okay

640
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:48,609
good ideas I want to spoof it I hope

641
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:50,469
you're absolutely honest when that does

642
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:53,469
it do drink rats just like I can make

643
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,730
animal sounds or I can lose flowers so I

644
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,089
can be like any little Missy in the

645
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,400
trance

646
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:58,599
you're a flower yeah I am what crow

647
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,470
doesn't want to bouquet flowers

648
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:04,329
I can also all crow do an entertaining

649
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,690
it's harmless potentially effect that is

650
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:11,740
following these Oh beautiful I like

651
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:14,730
animal noises I'm unprecedented a ssin

652
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:17,259
for okay for nature [ __ ] got it okay

653
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,630
good alright so we're throwing out a

654
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:21,400
bunch of light yes

655
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,470
am i involved in this light you want me

656
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,930
to just hang on to it unless you have I

657
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:28,450
can put those dancing lights right in it

658
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,039
yeah many eyes yeah the cat want the

659
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,240
path I'm going to flash the lights and

660
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:35,889
then the dancing lights and the sound

661
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,359
and the normal maximum I even to go I'm

662
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,740
assuming running deeper in all right

663
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,669
running deeper in what I'm that kill it

664
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,769
is that what we're looking for

665
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:49,180

in all of this so we've come upon like

685
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:44,259
the scraped out zone right with the nest

686
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:46,750
in it however they can be here but

687
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,679
there's still a clear like it continues

688
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,019
on which

689
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,450
would have done and we not encountered

690
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:54,159
this tiefling in a nest right we didn't

691
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:56,558
come to a like I'd like at Google yet

692
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,480
we're just like it's it's it's

693
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:01,599
definitely starting to loosen when you

694
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,760
can see that the the caverns like the

695
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,369
glassing yeah you saw there is starting

696
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,690
to sort of break down oh it's a visit

697
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:09,160
apparently if maybe it's a period of

698
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,650
time I know I'm not sure you'll

699
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:14,949
investigate it but the stability of the

700
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,858
cavern the farther you get is is not it

701
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:19,689
wasn't it was not like dwarven made you

702
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:21,308
know like it wasn't it wasn't intended

703
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,690
I just thought your Dark Lord could like

704
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:25,960
you know make a good cavern or something

705
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:27,608
weird but no angle or stroke him could

706
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,108
use the necklace to choke him he's not

707
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:32,348

is and there's actually so there's a new

957
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:20,338
a new challenger like if we were playing

958
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:23,579
the street fighter version of the c-team

959
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:26,880
do that you would see a bar that came

960
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:30,119
across and said here comes a new

961
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,239
challenger oh I want to look in at the

962
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:35,039
window just be like yeah

963
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:39,420
so you see you can hear the music even

964
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:41,099
outside on the what what kind of music

965
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,920

00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,999
instrument does it sound like oh no I'm

967
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,278
not thinking I'm thinking something else

968
00:47:44,998 --> 00:47:49,139
yeah no oh it's a it's a lute it's a

969
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:51,179
pretty traditional huh that's a pretty

970
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:52,498
traditional scenario over on the small

971
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:53,548
stage that has heretofore been

972
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:56,308
completely empty

973
00:47:53,548 --> 00:48:01,230
Tom stage yeah yeah you can see uh you

974
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:08,880
can see a woman dark skin

975
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:12,210
red red robe definitely in command of

976
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:17,910
this in um and you can see you can see

977
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:20,338
some very idle cup drying happening at

978
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:23,009
that I just gonna say my is profit

979
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:27,088
really yeah yeah yeah you can see you

980
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:29,190
can see that just you're not sure this

981
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:32,179
glass is being dried at all like you

982
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:34,230
think it is probably still wet and

983
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:36,779
occasionally someone will come up for a

984
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:39,030
drink and then she won't look at them

985
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,089
and she just kind of waved them away you

986
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:43,440
can tell that this is this is what this

987
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:46,019
Inn is about at the end of the day

988
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,289
imagine two points in this continuum

989
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:53,608
imagine just complete unfettered

990
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:56,279
creativity and then strength and

991
00:48:53,608 --> 00:48:58,219
discipline over here and then there the

992
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,849
weird battery that makes this place work

993
00:48:58,219 --> 00:49:03,659
hmm interesting

994
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:05,730
okay well I won just make note I'm like

hair with a single red streak on the

1083
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:24,059
front um she is a she's playing it

1084
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:27,720
left-handed which is statistically

1085
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:29,700
speaking novel but mildly interesting

1086
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,298
yeah but it's it a lot more inning it

1087
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:35,548
isn't a left-handed Luke's it is um

1088
00:53:32,298 --> 00:53:38,309
she's just playing it she's playing it

1089
00:53:35,548 --> 00:53:42,929
backwards facing mm oh just to show off

1090
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:46,019
we're learning who knows yeah a keytar

1091
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:48,690
yeah nice Sheena Farrell close this is

1092
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:51,798
great and prophetess is a very big fan

1093
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:55,619
bewitched how crowded is that is the end

1094
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:58,889
it's good okay it's good I mean you've

1095
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:00,599
had to take a steep and one of the one

1096
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:02,730
of the tables at the very edge near the

1097
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:05,068
near the bar I decided this place is

1098
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,150
this place is jumping okay but if this

1099
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:08,278
is the first time you've seen this

1100
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,809
performer so yeah it may be that that is

1101
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:13,289
the explanation or maybe they just

1102
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:17,190
haven't been here nice okay where now

1103
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:19,769
where are you that um I feel like my I'm

1104
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,900
in our little common room with the door

1105
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:23,669
open so I can hear everything but I'm

1106
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,180
just like love that lost in my thoughts

1107
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,380
thinking about via the symptoms I don't

1108
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:29,608
want to speak up so I like I have

1109
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,778
parchment out like I'm supposed to be

1110
00:54:29,608 --> 00:54:32,309
writing and I'm just not doing anything

1111
00:54:30,778 --> 00:54:35,369
so I have

1112
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:37,259
sought you out and before you can do

1113
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:42,659
anything on a corner of the parchment I

1114
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:44,310
draw the symbol I say thank you and I

1115
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:46,199
scribble it out immediately without

1116
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:48,929
thinking of course not that's ridiculous

1117
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:52,460
never seen that what is that let some

1118
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:57,389
drow garbage men to my knowledge but I

1119
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:59,400
mean if you take a closer look at it and

1120
00:54:57,389 --> 00:55:02,759
then well it scribbles it out so hard

1121
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:06,000
she rips the like nice vellum that she

1122
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,010
had out and then she's good at since

1123
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,360
ridiculous trades that she's like I got

1124
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:13,770
and then she's like trying to rip it and

1125
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:16,710
she can't rip it and crumpled it up and

1126
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:19,920
I was okay I'm like what are you getting

1127
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:22,500
at what do you know about it all I know

1128
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,570
is that I can identify it and every

1129
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,300
other symbol in that in that space I

1130
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:30,930
couldn't absorb I couldn't see it they

1131
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:37,769
never resolved but that one did but I

1132
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:40,649
don't know what it means um that why

1133
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:42,840
you're bothered by it I'm not bugging me

1134
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,190
I'm not gonna try to said I was bothered

1135
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,650
by it

1136
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,450
you said I was bothered by this is the

1137
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,860
new thing for the father I'm not

1138
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:52,619
bothered yeah I think others straight on

1139
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:57,559
unmindful whipping yeah that's all you

1140
00:55:52,619 --> 00:56:00,380
ah I assume okay I thought that this was

1141
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:03,000
yeah you were bothered sweet little

1142
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:05,160
clarify maybe it's some sort of a

1143
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,909
document something that I'm not aware of

1144
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:13,679
where you rend something that an

1145
00:56:08,909 --> 00:56:15,599
intruder shot I just I'm it's just that

1146
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:16,829
I'm the documentarian I'm supposed to be

1147
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,839
the one that writes on everything if you

1148
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:21,239
write on it's null and void and that's

1149
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:26,280
not what you do this is what I do this

1150
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:29,489
is my thing I'll never write again I see

1151
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:37,440
a pen in your hand filthy guy and then

1152
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:39,899
I'm and then uh so you know I'm well

1153
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,490
that's like I'm sitting there and I'm

1154
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,690
like feeling very trapped like I you

1155
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:45,539
know like someone just walked in on me

1156
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,679
doing something right and um but cut

1157
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:48,509
through it's like being able to

1158
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:51,599
recognize that I feel like there'd be a

1159
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:54,360
moment now where walnuts like okay well

1160
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,429
I can't trust him if he can recognize it

1161
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,329
like maybe maybe he's like part of it or

1162
00:56:56,429 --> 00:57:00,000
something like that

1163
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:00,869

1164
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,150

now we'll remember that yeah - a - yeah

1167
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,730
because now I'm thinking that he can

1168
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,009
recognizes them he must have some

1169
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:17,519

button

1464
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:02,250
absolutely so this is the I think

1465
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,560
everybody has the information but I'm

1466
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:07,010

Westbridge this time there's no there's

happen

1649
01:20:54,829 --> 01:21:00,079
um yeah I think I'm gonna veer around it

1650
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:01,909
I'm gonna give it a wide berth

1651
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:03,380

1652
01:21:01,909 --> 01:21:07,130

standing

1657
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:17,650
yeah at any rate the two people who

1658
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:20,659
lived there yeah exactly at cause I'm or

1659
01:21:17,649 --> 01:21:22,549
then you continue north through West

1660
01:21:20,659 --> 01:21:27,859
bridge and you can see you can see that

1661
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:29,390
vast apron of the Crypt Garden forest

1662
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:33,469
sort of reaching out in the great

1663
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:36,110
distance closer to the road and then

1664
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:38,150
there are there are signs that lead away

1665
01:21:36,109 --> 01:21:40,789
from the main road that you don't

1666
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:45,670
remember going in in the crypt garden

1667
01:21:40,789 --> 01:21:48,800
forest is a place where druids and

1668
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:52,130
ancient elven sorcery holds sway it's

1669
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,210
not a strip mall there's no you know

1670
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:55,039
what I mean like there's there's I don't

1671
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:57,230
know what you mean yeah there should be

1672
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:58,850
nothing in there yeah um there's no

1673
01:21:57,229 --> 01:22:00,319
paradise yeah exactly

1674
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:02,539
sorry it's not again LM only there

1675
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:04,969
aren't great savings on cups believe it

1676
01:22:02,539 --> 01:22:06,800
oh yeah I'm on top of the Carmen you

1677
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:09,260
have like mixed feelings about going

1678
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,539
near the Crypt guarding force yeah now

1679
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,480
also the exaggeration as we're going

1680
01:22:11,539 --> 01:22:18,979
towards it yes so there is so there is a

1681
01:22:13,479 --> 01:22:24,679
sign planted in the road of substantial

1682
01:22:18,979 --> 01:22:27,109
measure wrought iron and wood that says

1683
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:30,800
NEMA's ear and then points off into a

1684
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:33,619
road that you don't remember and should

1685
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,690
not be there so I definitely have like a

1686
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:37,909
sinking feeling where you think that

1687
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:40,309
something is wrong but you are in denial

1688
01:22:37,909 --> 01:22:40,869
and kind of hoping that your be wrong

1689
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:44,260
about that

1690
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:48,439
yeah that everything is actually ok so

1691
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:53,739
the card is is continuing to roll deeper

1692
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:57,739
and darker through this forest and I

1693
01:22:53,739 --> 01:23:03,619
mean you know just from looking around

1694
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:05,659
this is this is your place this is this

1695
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:11,210
place this is the home you couldn't

1696
01:23:05,659 --> 01:23:13,340
return to after the destruction of the

1697
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:16,730
order which you were not able to stop

1698
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:19,360
because you were young and unable to

1699
01:23:16,729 --> 01:23:22,099
help and thought you had a better plan

1700
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:24,619
the wages are that are coming back now

1701
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:26,180
yes as you are as you're continuing to

1702
01:23:24,619 --> 01:23:28,010
press further and further in and the

1703
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:34,400
light from the canopy is getting darker

1704
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:38,300
and darker you see in the middle of an

1705
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:41,420
enclave an axe anima Grove you see a

1706
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:53,270
walled city rise out in the gutted

1707
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:56,230
center of this wood so I like don't

1708
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:59,360
believe what I'm seeing

1709
01:23:56,229 --> 01:24:01,759
like but on the other hand I can't

1710
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,289
believe that this is happen but on the

1711
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:08,060
other hand I can because of like being

1712
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:10,279
Cydia sness of society and I'm just

1713
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:11,480
following my fists and I'm on the roof

1714
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:13,279
of the cart so nobody could see me which

1715
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:15,529
is like tears streaming down her face

1716
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:18,529
and like her nails are like cutting into

1717
01:24:15,529 --> 01:24:22,519
her hands it's like like cannot control

1718
01:24:18,529 --> 01:24:24,739
ourselves just rigid with rage but stays

1719
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:28,280
quiet as much as we get closer there is

1720
01:24:24,739 --> 01:24:30,409
a great gate even at the even at the

1721
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:34,489
entrance at the bottom of Suisse these

1722
01:24:30,409 --> 01:24:38,680
great walls are smooth stone they rise

1723
01:24:34,489 --> 01:24:41,510
up and they bulge out around the sides

1724
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:44,180
you can see them sort of disappearing

1725
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:48,350
into the distance the city widens from

1726
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:50,930
this point and this great gate is very

1727
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:54,650
similar in fact to the sign that was out

1728
01:24:50,930 --> 01:25:00,530
posted at the road where it's a mixture

1729
01:24:54,649 --> 01:25:04,519
of wood and then a vine with leaves that

1730
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:09,529
look like steel meshed through it and it

1731
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:13,460
says men Azir on the sign but it has

1732
01:25:09,529 --> 01:25:15,739
druidic writing in it which I can read

1733
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:16,909
what does it say would you like to read

1734
01:25:15,739 --> 01:25:18,289
the description

1735
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:21,050
or do you have the druidic description

1736
01:25:18,289 --> 01:25:23,359
here uh yeah it's there two sheets for

1737
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:27,529
the for the fans at home um

1738
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:29,479
yeah hang on wait where is it Shh oh no

1739
01:25:27,529 --> 01:25:32,960
don't I have it on this one another

1740
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:34,789
birthday she yeah sorry this is a new

1741
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,920
sheet guys yeah yeah we leveled up this

1742
01:25:34,789 --> 01:25:38,029
is your level four [ __ ] no I don't know

1743
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,369
where I have oh here it is

1744
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:43,219
I know drew attic hidden messages with

1745
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:44,510
it can only be understood by who no

1746
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,430
druidic maybe

1747
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:48,949
yeah it's with anybody crazier than that

1748
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:50,680
because even if you know all languages

1749
01:25:48,949 --> 01:25:54,470
you actually still need a magical means

1750
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:56,420
to perceive it so I can't reason because

1751
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:59,030
if they caught it isn't like a written

1752
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:01,699
language right it's a language of it's

1753
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:03,469
like steganography the data is hidden in

1754
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:08,389
structures in natural structures right

1755
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:14,900
so the it says man is here but plainly

1756
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:17,900
in druidic it's a graveyard I don't know

1757
01:26:14,899 --> 01:26:22,869
I feel like we'll play please really are

1758
01:26:17,899 --> 01:26:26,839

did yes ma district that's a different

1772
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:17,989
it's a different spelling obviously it

1773
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:20,030
has a different derivation yeah the

1774
01:27:17,989 --> 01:27:21,559
apology is usually that means but it's

1775
01:27:20,029 --> 01:27:23,518

weight having the horns right they

laughs apparently the hammock district

1780
01:27:33,269 --> 01:27:40,559
means something to them they you can see

1781
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:44,969
one of them moving up to crank this

1782
01:27:40,559 --> 01:27:47,880
giant wheel and the gate opens up enough

1783
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:49,618
for the car to roll through announces a

1784
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,748
sapling in the gate that's trying to

1785
01:27:49,618 --> 01:27:57,929

NEMA's air it seems like there is a

1806
01:28:44,969 --> 01:28:52,618
great main road that sort of winds

1807
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:54,469
straight from this path and wines as

1808
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:58,799
deep into the city as you can see and

1809
01:28:54,469 --> 01:29:02,550
then a very small almost like tributary

1810
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:06,119
style streets and paths that lead out

1811
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:07,800

what's the best city and you can see

1814
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:14,698
that this main road actually travels

1815
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:16,019
straight through the bottom so in the

1816
01:29:14,698 --> 01:29:20,189
very center there's a corner there's a

1817
01:29:16,019 --> 01:29:22,800
sort of high ridge that exact sort of

1818
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:23,339
sits in the middle of the city and you

1819
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,610
can see

1820
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:28,679
housing of a very different sort okay at

1821
01:29:26,609 --> 01:29:32,689
the top of it that's the realm known as

1822
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:36,420

1824
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,880
of

1825
01:29:36,689 --> 01:29:41,460
round spire but you can see that this

1826
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:46,800
the main road actually travels straight

1827
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:50,039

1973
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:23,400

01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:16,340
here the places that have had the

1992
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:18,539
biggest complaints about rats in town

1993
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:21,810
his feeling is that if you're able to

1994
01:37:18,539 --> 01:37:24,689
resolve these nests then you'll be then

1995
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:26,610

1996
01:37:24,689 --> 01:37:30,619

01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:40,289
we allow you feel about drought are we

2000
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:42,449
like a musical rats that we find but he

2001
01:37:40,289 --> 01:37:43,890
says well I think that if you I think

2002
01:37:42,449 --> 01:37:46,500
that if you would look at the document

2003
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:49,140
that method of disposal is at the

2004
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:52,050
contractor discretion if these rats are

2005
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:57,890
not in them is here then they are not in

2006
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:57,890
my domain I can't count on them for both

2007
01:38:04,609 --> 01:38:09,829

for yeah there's two there's two marks

2011
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:24,400
on the map it should be very very easy

2012
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:26,600
even just the map but you also have

2013
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:29,988

Corey a toy all right I got 18 and it's

2027
01:39:18,289 --> 01:39:23,449
probably nothing but this is a this is a

2028
01:39:21,649 --> 01:39:25,549
weird town like I said it seems like it

2029
01:39:23,449 --> 01:39:26,449
was made like there's some kind of a kid

2030
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:27,920
okay

2031
01:39:26,449 --> 01:39:32,960
you know what I mean like it's art very

2032
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:36,170
very regimented sure milquetoast yeah

2033
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:38,420
highly coughing it's just like a fractal

2034
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:41,869
almost okay like everything that's in it

2035
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:44,029
is all just different sizes of the same

2036
01:39:41,869 --> 01:39:45,649
thing it's like no modular yeah we yeah

2037
01:39:44,029 --> 01:39:47,840
yeah with mayor's cottages a certain

2038
01:39:45,649 --> 01:39:50,269
size on a stand but he attend but the

2039
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,010
other ones are they're very similar in

2040
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:54,470
construction just turn to face a

2041
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:56,180
different way right you know what I mean

2042
01:39:54,470 --> 01:40:00,050
yeah the different size of cookiecutter

2043
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:00,739
um yeah McMansion exactly okay but it's

2044
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:02,000
probably fine

2045
01:40:00,738 --> 01:40:03,409
that's what you're telling me well yeah

2046
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,689
I mean it's you thought you'd notice

2047
01:40:03,409 --> 01:40:08,389
something but this place is just really

2048
01:40:05,689 --> 01:40:10,819
weird like a liquid like the roads that

2049
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:13,820
go off on the sides are very very small

2050
01:40:10,819 --> 01:40:15,319
not really cart worthy you know what I

2051
01:40:13,819 --> 01:40:17,539
mean kind of like really four foot

2052
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:19,909
traffic awesome Oh Eddie's yeah yes

2053
01:40:17,539 --> 01:40:21,800
problem the lorries and other center

2054
01:40:19,909 --> 01:40:23,899
Isle is really the only one that's

2055
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:24,909
appropriate for would it be something

2056
01:40:23,899 --> 01:40:28,448
that might cartel

2057
01:40:24,908 --> 01:40:30,849
prefer a background would allow me to do

2058
01:40:28,448 --> 01:40:32,559
an extra check on like is there

2059
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:34,840
something you need to check a distant

2060
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,670
restaurant it's odd alright you leave it

2061
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,090
I mean you're not you're not wrong way

2062
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:39,369
around

2063
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:41,199
yeah familiar how hot is it you're not

2064
01:40:39,369 --> 01:40:44,170
going to be here with it with a layout

2065
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:47,469
like this oh you would not do this like

2066
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:49,270
okay it's bad city planning yes exactly

2067
01:40:47,469 --> 01:40:52,119
well is there to the top okay so

2068
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:54,670
actually even math and we both go yeah

2069
01:40:52,119 --> 01:40:56,529
it's fine um and then you're going to

2070
01:40:54,670 --> 01:41:00,190
take us to the first of these locations

2071
01:40:56,529 --> 01:41:05,679
okay so the nearest one is the ironbark

2072
01:41:00,189 --> 01:41:08,619
in a few short blocks it is at the end

2073
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:12,060
of one of those is at the end of one of

2074
01:41:08,619 --> 01:41:15,579
these small paths that branches off

2075
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:17,920
branches off to the left again and you

2076
01:41:15,579 --> 01:41:19,809
can see sort of what with a branches

2077
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:24,789
yeah branches yet we go to the murdered

2078
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:27,389
forest hotel yeah I don't like it

2079
01:41:24,789 --> 01:41:30,609
you know why leave me alone Jerry

2080
01:41:27,389 --> 01:41:32,710
hahahaha and you can see it seems like

2081
01:41:30,609 --> 01:41:34,269
they are making I like it if they're

2082
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:35,980
making they're making the best of it

2083
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:38,969
back here like it's sort of ducted in

2084
01:41:35,979 --> 01:41:41,619
the back of this cul-de-sac looks warm

2085
01:41:38,969 --> 01:41:43,840
inviting a little bit smaller than some

2086
01:41:41,619 --> 01:41:45,969
of the surrounding buildings here but

2087
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:49,420
you know not not inappropriate okay

2088
01:41:45,969 --> 01:41:51,698
right not the worst record this is off

2089
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:54,940

2387
01:55:52,229 --> 01:55:56,879
fine alternatively we can all be open a

2388
01:55:54,359 --> 01:55:58,079

2389
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:00,060
friendly creature and attacking a

2390
01:55:58,079 --> 01:56:01,680
creature within 5 feet of you okay you

2391
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:02,970
faint distract the target or in some

2392
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:04,710
other way team up to make your allies

2393
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:06,750
attack more effective if you're how I

2394
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:08,609
attacks the target before your next turn

2395
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:09,960
the first attack role is made to the

2396
01:56:08,609 --> 01:56:11,729
advantage so it there are some

2397
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:13,500
limitations in there okay it has to

2398
01:56:11,729 --> 01:56:17,099
attack right it has to attack your

2399
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:19,890
target right or just or like draw it

2400
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:21,240

sized circle of silver light that

2531
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:35,690

if I were to do a bite on the third yes

2816
02:16:52,819 --> 02:16:57,260
they would have been knocked prone but I

2817
02:16:55,638 --> 02:17:00,049
just want to do the knocking prone

2818
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:02,599

02:17:17,299 --> 02:17:20,449
thing so you basically now it's like

2826
02:17:19,549 --> 02:17:23,179

shoulder just snapping and biting at the

2830
02:17:29,510 --> 02:17:40,540

2831
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:43,750
you're delighted attention toward legato

2832
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:48,790
you notice that there is another rat

2833
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:52,069
sort of observing the proceedings not

2834
02:17:48,790 --> 02:17:56,360
not engaging in aggression of any kind

2835
02:17:52,069 --> 02:17:59,750
just simply observing and you can see

2836
02:17:56,360 --> 02:18:04,670
that there is actually a glow a glow of

2837
02:17:59,750 --> 02:18:08,569
light from the surface much like my own

02:18:04,670 --> 02:18:14,420
