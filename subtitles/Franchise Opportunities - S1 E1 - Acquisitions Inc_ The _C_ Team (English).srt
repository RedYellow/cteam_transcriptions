1
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,119
JERRY: Hello.

2
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,640
I'm Jerry Holkins. I'm also Tycho Brahe and I'm also Omin Dran.

3
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,899
But today I am Jerry Holkins, Dungeon Master of the "C" Team.

4
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,039
It is my great pleasure to introduce the players.

5
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,159
To my right, Ryan Hartman as Donaar Blit'zen.  RYAN: (claps heartily)

6
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,979
JERRY: Which, I'm offended. No-- That's-- None of that.

7
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,719
RYAN: Oh.

8
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,480
JERRY: You're already in character?

9
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,299
KRIS: Solemn, solemn.

10
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:14,239
JERRY: No, don't. No. No, not yet. It's not time. RYAN: Ten? Oh.

11
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,179
JERRY: Amy Falcone as Walnut Dankgrass.

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,780
Which might be Dank-Grass.

13
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,420
JERRY: That's-- we'll investigate it. AMY: Mm mmm. &gt;&gt; KATE: The K is silent.

14
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:27,120
JERRY: Kate Welch as Rosie Beestinger.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,460
The most dangerous grandmother in the Forgotten Realms.

16
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:40,579
Kris Straub as his OC character headcanon fan insert, K'thriss Drow'b.

17
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,519
KRIS: Yeah. The real deal.

18
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,719
JERRY: The actual-- Exactly. RYAN: Slashfic.

19
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,039
KRIS: With myself. RYAN: Yeah.

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,880
JERRY: All right. Well hey, motherfuckers, are we ready to play some Dungeons &amp; Dragons?

21
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,019
KATE: Ready motherfucker. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yes. JERRY: All right, let's do it, let's do it.

22
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:56,560
JERRY: Now, there is something of a surprise that greets you.

23
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,579
You have obviously-- you have your own reasons

24
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,560
for wanting to become a licensor of Acquisitions Incorporated.

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,060
The fastest growing adventuring company in FaerÃ»n.

26
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,560
But the license that you get back has a couple conditions that you weren't expecting.

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,960
And it also comes with a strange object. So what you learn, as fully 40 pages of documentation return to you,

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,439
is that the license that you have purchased, perhaps the only license that is available,

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,000
is for 25% of one license.

30
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,840
AMY: Uh... JERRY: Yeah.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,120
JERRY: You're going over it, you're going over it. Everything seems like it's okay. Very, very, small text

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,000
on the back of the last page, on the bottom, says that licenses of Acquisitions Incorporated

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,099
in the Dessarin Valley, which is the region you'll be operating in, are sold in tranches of 25%.

34
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:09,000
Something like a medieval dating service, they will choose three other licensors and build you into a

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,180
company designed for maximum mission effectiveness based on your--

36
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,400
RYAN: It's like a timeshare? JERRY: Exactly.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
JERRY: It's like a timeshare but for adventuring--

38
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,420
RYAN: Okay.

39
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,800
JERRY: in this particular region. KATE: Wow.

40
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,280
JERRY: It also comes with one other thing. It comes with an acorn.

41
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,560
JERRY: Obviously that gets you cranked up.  AMY: (scoffs) Whoo!

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,840
JERRY: Yeah. Good stuff right?

43
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,659
AMY: (excited growl) RYAN: Her name's Walnut.

44
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,799
JERRY: Fucking reel it in, okay?

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,780
AMY: Sorry. Pornographic. JERRY: We can't have the whole game...

46
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,520
JERRY: just beads of sweat.

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:46,280
Each of these acorns has had the cap dipped in gold, and there is a note that accompanies it that says that

48
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:57,800
you are to enter an inn called the Dran &amp; Courtier noon the next day. So there is a very, very short timeline...

49
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,780
for you to even achieve this objective. Luckily, you're all well within that range. It will not be a difficult process.

50
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:11,079
You are to meet there at noon, and the cap-- the acorn must be with you.

51
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:22,040
K'thriss Drow'b. You were dropped off in this town via the Acquisitions Incorporated airship.

52
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,300
KRIS: I don't remember.

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,060
JERRY: You don't a hundred percent remember any of this. The fact of the matter is--

54
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:36,120
is that your Dungeons &amp; Dragons career-- the very first roll that you ever made was a one. And that was in the

55
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,399
process of you contacting another plane for advice. And what happened instead was that your entire

56
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:49,279
consciousness became transmuted into a kind of madness that made everything absolutely hilarious.

57
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,599
And the amount of hilarity was connected directly to how bad things are.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
KRIS: Right.

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,379
JERRY: It's been a huge problem.

60
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,360
You awaken in a filthy alley.

61
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,500
RYAN: Naked.

62
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,160
JERRY: Na-- No. I'm going to run this.

63
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,960
KRIS: I take my clothes off. JERRY: Goddamn it!

64
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,279
JERRY: Listen! RYAN: Finally.

65
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,119
JERRY: Do you see this? Do you see this screen?

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:22,759
It's like this... You awaken with this note, written in your own hand.

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,740
Your focus, which is a chunk of a dark altar that you found in the Underdark.

68
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,560
As a warlock you have the capacity-- the Eyes of the Runekeeper allow you to read any language,

69
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:45,019
but there were symbols on this altar that you couldn't perceive. And because you could not perceive them

70
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:52,560
they became almost fetishistic for you. It's not normal for you. As soon as you see a piece of text,

71
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,379
no matter where or when it's from, you can perceive it, but these symbols eluded you.

72
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,680
You were able to carve a chunk of it out and you focus your warlock powers through it.

73
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:09,219
It is burning hot in your hand. This note is in your other hand, written in your own handwriting.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,459
KRIS: Ink? JERRY: Yes.

75
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,959
KRIS: Okay. JERRY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Phew.

76
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,160
KATE: You sound disappointed.

77
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,520
(laughter)

78
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,899
JERRY: Your forehead is also hot.

79
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,719
There is a raised welt on it that you can feel with the back of your hand.

80
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
KRIS: Oh I don't like it. Okay.

81
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:30,220
JERRY: The only thing that you know right now is that I had to take your 9th level character sheet away.

82
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,180
You now have this shit-eater 3rd level character--

83
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,500
KRIS: This mess. KATE: Six levels...

84
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,680
JERRY: (laughs) version of the same character.

85
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,819
KRIS: Where's the rest of it?

86
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,960
JERRY: It's all gone, it's all gone.

87
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,599
KRIS: It just started. JERRY: It's true.

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,860
JERRY: But you're now scrubbing it with the rest of them.

89
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:58,319
And you know that you are in the town of Red Larch, where you're supposed to be, but there are many, many

90
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:06,659
other things that you do not know; up to and including the incredible sorceries that you developed

91
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,220
JERRY: over the last six years.  KRIS: Right.

92
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,780
AMY: (laughs) That stinks. JERRY: Yeah.

93
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,559
KATE: That super sucks, dude. RYAN: Everyone's writing stuff down.

94
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,899
JERRY: Exactly. AMY: Don't worry about it.

95
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,240
JERRY: You steady yourself against-- KATE: We're the brains.

96
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,699
JERRY: the stone wall of this-- KRIS: The least filthy wall.

97
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,019
JERRY: Yeah, the least filthy wall you can find. KRIS: I check.

98
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:25,759
JERRY: Here, percep-- No, we're not going to do it.

99
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,560
KRIS: You stick your hand right through. JERRY: Minimally, "Aw it's gross, it's the worst."

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,220
JERRY: Then you step in something. You don't like that either.

101
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,200
KRIS: Naw!

102
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,279
JERRY: You steady yourself against the edge of a wall, and as you come around the corner, you can see a sign

103
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,959
that hangs in front of the building, that reads, "The Dran &amp; Courtier."

104
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,459
KRIS: Oh, this is ideal.

105
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:49,859
JERRY: Yeah, this is an optimal scenario for you. Everything turned out great.

106
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,600
Walnut Dankgrass.

107
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:58,980
You are approaching Red Larch from the wood to the north, near the base of the Sword Mountains.

108
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:06,060
A place that's often been known for druidic goings-on. Your type of shit.

109
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,519
RYAN: Maybe I'll write stuff too.

110
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,160
JERRY: You can sense-- Yeah, you can be a part of this team as well.

111
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,220
Be sure to open that up. Draw funny pictures.

112
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,960
RYAN: Oh.

113
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,199
JERRY: Whatever feels good to you at the time.

114
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:28,579
Walnut, you know even just walking across the soil on the Long Road that cuts right through the middle of

115
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:34,299
Red Larch, you know that a forest was cut down for this.

116
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,019
AMY: Okay. JERRY: You just-- You know. You can tell from the soil...

117
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:48,299
Even your feet on the soil on the way to the town, you know that this was a beautiful red larch forest

118
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:55,679
that the people of this town had the audacity to name it after. There is nothing here-- There is nothing even

119
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,839
remotely larchian about the awful place that they have manufactured here.

120
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,000
AMY: I am internalizing all of this.

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,419
JERRY: Exactly. It's all going to go into your journal.

122
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,159
AMY: (repressed grunt) Yep. JERRY: Right?

123
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,759
JERRY: There's going to be a poem.

124
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,419
JERRY: And you accept that. Right? AMY: Mmhmm. yes.

125
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:18,539
JERRY: But as you cross straight down through-- obviously your mode of dress is distinctive.

126
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:25,639
But the Long Road through Red Larch that goes from Mirabar in the north and Waterdeep in the south

127
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,939
brings all kinds through this village. No one's too surprised by this particular raiment.

128
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:39,819
You have directions that will take you to the Dran &amp; Courtier. It's not quite on the main drag. It's off a bit.

129
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,879
You see wagon shops... places that you make a note to hate in the future.

130
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,379
AMY: Just internally making that shit list.

131
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,720
JERRY: Exactly, exactly.

132
00:09:51,399 --> 00:10:01,019
And as you turn the corner... you can see the sign of the Dran &amp; Coutier and you can also see a drow

133
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:08,379
in blue raiment supporting himself against the front if it. You don't know if he's been here all night.

134
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:14,600
You don't know if he's trying to get back in after a night of drinking. But he clearly is having a difficult time

135
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,019
supporting himself in an upright, bipedal way.

136
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:20,620
AMY: I make a snap judgement.

137
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,879
(laughter)

138
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,179
KRIS: As is your right.

139
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,940
AMY: Okay.

140
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,820
JERRY: Yeah so you're welcome to interact or I can continue with the situation.

141
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,959
AMY: I think Walnut's there for, you know-- I'm just here for my own things I don't need to--

142
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,120
AMY: get involved in whatever that is. KRIS: A door you don't want to open.

143
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,799
AMY: That's not something I want to mess with.

144
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,759
KRIS: Right.

145
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,860
JERRY: You just let that happen. AMY: Yeah.

146
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,220
JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen.

147
00:10:49,460 --> 00:11:00,000
Your dragonborn village is on the eastern ridge of the Sword Mountains. The secrets of that town are held in a

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,139
cavern high up that you are familiar with from your own rite of passage that we'll get into later in this campaign.

149
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,259
RYAN: Oh ho...

150
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:19,300
JERRY: But there's no walking for you. As a relatively highborn person in that-- there is a cart that drives you

151
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:22,299
basically to the gate of Red Larch.

152
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,939
AMY: Of course... RYAN: (laughs)

153
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,620
RYAN: What are you shaking your head for?

154
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,840
JERRY: You step off and the cart raises, substantially, as you've been deposited.

155
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,539
You get the nod from the front and they roll away.

156
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:46,339
You cross much the same path that Walnut did on the way in. You curve over to the left first.

157
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:54,660
You see other shops, you see the town waking up and getting ready for the day. And you approach a...

158
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:08,060
You approach the Dran &amp; Courtier from the north. You can see what is clearly a druid in like a warlike raiment.

159
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:16,579
It isn't the classic robes, there's nobody getting any mistletoe at midnight here. This is a this is a druid that...

160
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,920
It's not your father's druid essentially. This is a druid that protects the natural world via another mechanism.

161
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:37,480
You can see her face furrowed with anger and rage at a drow in front of an inn called the Dran &amp; Courtier.

162
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,539
RYAN: Okay.

163
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,699
Which is where I am supposed to be going.

164
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,396
JERRY: Indeed. That's the document that you have.

165
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,779
RYAN: All right. And you're a mess.

166
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,439
KRIS: Don't look great. RYAN: All right.

167
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,259
RYAN: So I flip him a coin and I say, "Here you go, vagrant." And then I walk into the inn.

168
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,919
KATE: Are you naked?

169
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,719
KRIS: No, I think I... I mean vagrant doesn't imply nudity.

170
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,420
KRIS: I think that it's probably-- RYAN: I don't think-- It wasn't my intention.

171
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:02,500
KRIS: No, no, no.

172
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
RYAN: But I mean, pleasant coincidence... KRIS: I don't have any... &gt;&gt; AMY: Not yet...

173
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,840
KRIS: I wanted to explain. RYAN: I would've given you more coin.

174
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,519
JERRY: "No, nope. Actually, no I'm great."

175
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,579
KRIS: But all I can muster is, "Thank you, friend."

176
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,020
(laughter)

177
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,159
KRIS: (kissing sound) Mwah.

178
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,240
(laughter)

179
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,620
JERRY: Is it-- do you even catch it? Does it just hit you in the chest?

180
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,700
RYAN: It just bounces off your head. KRIS: It hits me right there.

181
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,160
RYAN: Right in the welt. AMY: Right in the welt.

182
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,360
JERRY: But you still have the presence of mind, "Oh great, yeah."

183
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,159
KRIS: Right. "Thank you."

184
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,500
JERRY: "I love those. I remember what those are for. Those are great."

185
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,559
"I want to get a bunch of those if I can."

186
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,319
RYAN: All without looking at him. Without eye contact.

187
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,220
KRIS: I was talking to the coin. JERRY: Yeah exactly.

188
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,759
JERRY: "Good job!" KRIS: "Oh you again, yes."

189
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,279
JERRY: "I love how round you are. I love all of this."

190
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:47,159
JERRY: So Rosie, you are approaching town from the south. Not quite-- Waterdeep is a week south.

191
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:58,280
You were actually in this area for other business already and so getting over here is is an easy jaunt for you.

192
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,240
You can see what you believe to be Red Larch, certainly the map would communicate that to you.

193
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:16,139
You can see it in sort of the middle distance there. You know you'll be there soon, when from a copse of trees

194
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:25,720
you see three young men intersect your path on your way to Red Larch.

195
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,659
KATE: Do these young men look... savory?

196
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,320
KATE: Or not so much? JERRY: Well here,

197
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,840
JERRY: let's grab some intuition and I am going to apply disadvantage to that. The channel has been kind enough

198
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,899
to provide me with bad rolls for players and I'm going to put them to fucking work.

199
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:51,600
KATE: Wonderful, wonderful. Okay so I'm going to roll a d20 with perception?

200
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
KATE: My perception check? What is it. JERRY: Let's see...

201
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,820
RYAN: Ooh. Nice. KATE: What do you got me doing here?

202
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,360
RYAN: I didn't know that were dice in this game. JERRY: No, insight. &gt;&gt; KATE: Insight? Okay.

203
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,939
JERRY: Yeah so roll two of them and take the lowest. KATE: Okay.

204
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,340
JERRY: I actually have your character sheet. KRIS: Mine might be the lowest, but--

205
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,280
KATE: I got a nine.

206
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,000
KATE: Okay and then I also got an eight and I have plus two wisdom?

207
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,679
Does that bonus apply?

208
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,819
JERRY: It does not in this case. KATE: All right, so eight.

209
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,580
JERRY: Yeah exactly. RYAN: I have plus three strength. Does that help?

210
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,759
(laughter)

211
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,600
KRIS: I confer some of my strength... no.

212
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,540
JERRY: So, one sidles into the middle of the road in front of you and the other two edge their way...

213
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,759
JERRY: just try to get behind in the periphery. KATE: Mmhmm.

214
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:42,400
JERRY: And you can see-- I mean, it doesn't require much sophistication to determine that a grandmother

215
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:51,962
walking this road... walking the Long Road outside of a town might represent something like

216
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:56,339
a bunch of juicy grapes hanging off of a vine.

217
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,440
KATE: She is juicy.

218
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:07,780
JERRY: Yeah, oh yeah. Every aspect of Rosie Beestinger to them communicates an easy mark.

219
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,259
KATE: Okay.

220
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,560
So there's one in front of me?

221
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,099
JERRY: One in front and two are edging around behind...

222
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,399
RYAN: Grapples. JERRY: And you can hear--

223
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:26,579
JERRY: You can hear behind you and to the right, you can hear the twang of a hand crossbow being loaded.

224
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,319
KATE: Hmm! Okay.

225
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
JERRY: So the young gentleman in front says,

226
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,100
"Good morning, grandmother."

227
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,060
KATE: "Good morning. Can you help escort me on my way to town?"

228
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,920
JERRY: (laughs) "This...?"

229
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,759
"You'll be on your way very quickly."

230
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,340
KATE: "Oh good." JERRY: "The transaction we have in mind"

231
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,160
JERRY: "shouldn't take more than a couple minutes."

232
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,519
KATE: "Wonderful." JERRY: "If you're smart."

233
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,899
KATE: "Oh I think I can be. How can I help you today?"

234
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,059
JERRY: "Anything you have, "

235
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,479
KATE: "Hmm..." JERRY: "that a shop would want..."

236
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,600
JERRY: "you're going to give it to us."

237
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,519
KATE: "I see." JERRY: "And then you're going to continue on. Upright."

238
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,880
KATE: "Hmm." JERRY: "There's another way it goes."

239
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,420
KATE: "Okay." JERRY: "Right?"

240
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,319
JERRY: He directs--

241
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:23,059
You think he might have had this speech before. You think that he might have leveraged this one.

242
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,700
Maybe practiced it on his mates.

243
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,220
He says, "There's not a lot of you to hide."

244
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
"It's five minutes work."

245
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,460
KATE: "Mmhmm. Interesting." RYAN: (laughs)

246
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,819
KATE: "Well--" JERRY: Are you pleased with yourself?

247
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:40,779
RYAN: Yeah that was good! I liked that.

248
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:47,639
KATE: "I don't have much that I can offer you. So I'm not sure I can be of help to you today."

249
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,220
"If you wouldn't mind just letting me on my way. I'm just here to do some business in town."

250
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,279
JERRY: "No. No, no, no. That's... Grandmother, that's not how this story ends at all."

251
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,079
KATE: "Hmmm."

252
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,279
JERRY: "That's not how this story ends at all" KATE: "Okay."

253
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,819
AMY: This is the most pleasant mugging I have ever seen!

254
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,099
JERRY: It's pleasant for now.

255
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:12,059
KATE: So I think I would like to try to intimidate this young gentleman.

256
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:23,379
JERRY: Now, Rosie, don't forget. You might be able to intimidate quite well with the assistance of your friends.

257
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,880
KATE: Oh that's so true!

258
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,280
JERRY: Of your vast network. Your social network...

259
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,519
KRIS: The social network. JERRY: has conferred--

260
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,554
JERRY: the Stingers, have conferred upon you a certain level of capacity in this.

261
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,059
KATE: My little beehive mmmm.

262
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,419
JERRY: Yeah, so the hive. So don't... KATE: Wonderful.

263
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,100
JERRY: Don't wait. I mean definitely put them to work.

264
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:51,240
KATE: Okay. I would love to use one of my special dice. My stinger bees.

265
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,940
JERRY: Yeah let's do it. All right. Let's see this intimidation. I have a copy of your character sheet here.

266
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:03,360
Let's-- oh shit! Oh wow, so you're a total motherfucker on this sort of thing. Even though you're a tiny grandma

267
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,519
you like to intimidate a motherfucker.

268
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,980
KATE: It's just a pastime.

269
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,180
JERRY: Well here listen, so advantage for you, Rosie Beestinger, means that you roll the d20 twice

270
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,779
and you add four to each of those rolls and you take the best of the two.

271
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,920
KATE: Goodness.

272
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,860
JERRY: So let's get to work. KATE: Okay.

273
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,079
AMY: Big money.

274
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,740
JERRY: Holy fucking... RYAN: Oh wow.

275
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,359
JERRY: All right that is a crit. KATE: That's a nat 20, folks.

276
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,459
JERRY: Let's see what the other one is just for kicks. KRIS: Oh my god.

277
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,240
KATE: Could be a 21. Never know. JERRY: Yeah, I was going say,

278
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,660
JERRY: let's see if there's another dice in there.

279
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,340
RYAN: A one. JERRY: That's a one.

280
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,839
KRIS: Does that cancel out?

281
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,339
JERRY: No. It doesn't cancel it out. So listen, obviously this 20--

282
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:49,559
This 20, it would let you cut this man in half just with a glance, but what does Rosie Beestinger do in this case?

283
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,200
KATE: I think Rosie Beestinger would like to-- Excuse me.

284
00:19:54,059 --> 00:20:02,460
I would like to give this young man a very cuttingly perceptive look and say,

285
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,700
"Don't I know your grandmother? Haven't we gone to some kind of party together?"

286
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:18,220
"Perhaps I've seen her around town? Isn't that someone that I might have encountered before?"

287
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:27,840
JERRY: You can see his hand sort of do this like a leaf in the wind, and he reaches for the dagger.

288
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,659
KATE: Mmhmm.

289
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,660
JERRY: and he unsnaps the top of it and he pulls out the dagger and the dagger falls on the ground.

290
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:44,560
Now, different people are reacting to this situation in different ways. The fellows behind are not in the

291
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:53,759
gruesome cone of the intimidation that you have laid out. And one of them, you think it might be on accident,

292
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,180
pulls the trigger of the crossbow.

293
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,860
KATE: Oh. RYAN: Hmm.

294
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,139
JERRY: So let's get some initiative going. KATE: Okay.

295
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,119
AMY: Watching K'thriss puke at the bar is like-- JERRY: That's a total shithole.

296
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,199
KATE: That's a ten, plus three. 13. JERRY: Yeah that's way better than me.

297
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,080
JERRY: Now don't be intimidated by the tiny vampire mouths. This is not a vampire.

298
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,819
KATE: Thank goodness. KRIS: Yet...

299
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:18,079
JERRY: It would be a very different-- (laughter)

300
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,580
RYAN: I've heard that before! JERRY: Yeah.

301
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,039
KRIS: Let the blood moon rises... JERRY: Yeah exactly, there's--

302
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
KRIS: Crossbow turns into fangs.

303
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,620
RYAN: It turns into a bat midflight.

304
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,899
RYAN &amp; JERRY: (bat squeaks and screeches noises)

305
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,384
JERRY: No no, so Rosie is going go first but that first attack is a surprising scenario,

306
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,740
JERRY: and so it's going to happen right away. KATE: Okay.

307
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,160
JERRY: Is your... AC 16, grandmother?

308
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,220
KATE: No, it is 15. JERRY: Okay.

309
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,019
JERRY: The crossbow bolt sails through the air.

310
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,259
KATE: I would like to deflect missile.

311
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:56,639
JERRY: Would you? KATE: I would.

312
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
JERRY: How does it work?

313
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,220
KATE: I roll a...

314
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:06,279
I believe I have the power to grab anything that is being deflected at me-- or sorry-- to deflect anything that's

315
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:14,180
being shot at me. I also roll a 1d6 plus-- 1d10 plus six, and if that is higher than the damage that would have

316
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,700
KATE: been dealt to me, I can grab the item in the air.  JERRY: Okay. Well...

317
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,860
JERRY: It is three points of damage so let's go ahead and get that dice roll,

318
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:23,779
but I'm pretty sure this is going to end with you holding...

319
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,279
KATE: That's a nine. JERRY: Yeah.

320
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:38,460
JERRY: It comes, and in a moment, in a moment... just a fluid shift, and you catch it over your shoulder.

321
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,620
KATE: I'm going to-- I do have the ability to then use this to throw, but I think that these young men are just a little

322
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:55,439
bit mislead. They've gone down the wrong path. So I'm going to simply hold that crossbow, turn,

323
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,160
look over my shoulder, and say, "Did you drop something?"

324
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,419
AMY: (whispers) Oh my god. RYAN: Yep bite it.

325
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,240
KATE: (laughs)

326
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:09,740
JERRY: He is scooting back. He is scooting way back, as far back as he can go, to the extent that he falls

327
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:16,380
down, and then continues to try to move back even though he's mostly on the ground. When you turn back

328
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,680
to look in front of you, there is-- the young man is now hiding in the bushes he was going to put your body in.

329
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:29,619
The third young man is nowhere to be seen. You see a tiny shape just running back down the Long Road.

330
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:30,939
It could be him.

331
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,700
KATE: I am going to continue on my way, unobstructed.

332
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,660
JERRY: You keep it as a souvenir? KATE: Absolutely.

333
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,720
JERRY: Perfect.

334
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,779
KRIS: I'm so tickled, I'm so tickled. KATE: I always keep them as a trophy.

335
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,740
JERRY: Exactly, it's just nice. It's nice. KATE: it's just nice.

336
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,039
KATE: Can I add that to my inventory?

337
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,899
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Absolutely. One crossbow bolt.

338
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,660
KATE: One... crossbow... bolt. AMY: A little souvenir.

339
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,000
JERRY: Exactly, exactly, so-- KATE: I put a smiley face next to it.

340
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,500
JERRY: Exactly.

341
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:08,599
You enter the town of Red Larch from the south and just off the first curve on the right, you can see loosely

342
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,399
swinging in the wind is the sign for the place that you are meant to go.

343
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:18,079
KATE: I assume I see this sad sack.

344
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:25,799
JERRY: Well you see one sad sack drow still sort of vibrating in place.

345
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:28,240
JERRY: You see... RYAN: Now a little richer.

346
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,259
JERRY: Exactly.

347
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,900
KRIS: Just still (kissing sound). Admiring it. JERRY: Indeed, you see...

348
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:40,839
JERRY: You see an intimidatingly garbed druid alongside. You're not sure what's going on there.

349
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,200
JERRY: And you've already gone inside, correct? RYAN: Yeah.

350
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:53,040
AMY: So as soon as I see Rosie looking my way, I immediately look like I've been caught being in trouble,

351
00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:02,019
and I look to this drow who is, you know, I'm a wood elf out of my element, I see that this is a drow out of his

352
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,139
element, and I walk up to him-- not too close?

353
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,700
JERRY: Not too close. AMY: Like not within like...

354
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,740
KRIS: You don't want-- there might be a scent. AMY: like projectile range, yeah. Yeah that.

355
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,420
KATE: They not looking too fresh. AMY: There's kind of barf situation?

356
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,660
JERRY: Yeah exactly, a cone weapon, obviously. AMY: Away from that.

357
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,080
AMY: But I say,

358
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,279
"Hello, fellow outsider. Can I help you get to where you're going? Can I help you inside?"

359
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,240
KRIS: "Ugh. Yeah you can--" AMY: "Get you some fluids..."

360
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:30,400
JERRY: Hydration. KATE: Rosie's like, "Isn't that sweet? Aren't you a dear."

361
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,699
ROSIE: "What a nice young elf." AMY: "Hello, ma'am."

362
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,380
KRIS: "I would love that, I would love it if we could wait until the sun was not out."

363
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,519
"So I could go inside without being destroyed by those beams."

364
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,920
KATE: "The sun is pretty much at its highest point right now."

365
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,060
KATE: "It's going to be a little while." KRIS: "Oh!. That's the worst thing you could say to me."

366
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,700
KRIS: "I'm just going to-- I was just going to pop inside, and collect myself. Hope they have a washroom."

367
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,400
AMY: "Okay." KRIS: "I appreciate it. "

368
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,360
KRIS: "Actually didn't fare too badly."

369
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,700
"Maybe I'll take up this occupation. I already got a coin out of it today."

370
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,740
(laughter)

371
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,620
"And I was deep in the alley, I didn't think anybody could see me."

372
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:14,459
AMY: "That's great."

373
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,579
KRIS: "So imagine how much better it could be if I'm on the stoop in front."

374
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:20,439
AMY: "I'm happy for you. That is super validating for you."

375
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,900
JERRY: Yeah exactly, you know. Internalize that.

376
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,200
KRIS: "But nonetheless I appreciate it." AMY: "Sure."

377
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,679
KATE: So are you just talking about why you're not going inside?

378
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,240
KRIS: No, I am going to go inside. KATE: Okay.

379
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,660
KATE: After the monologue. KRIS: There's no running water out here.

380
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,220
KATE: I see, okay, okay.

381
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:41,340
KRIS: I'm a dirty man. I mean it could help with the act, with the panhandling.

382
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,059
But I'm just going to go ahead and go inside.

383
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:47,319
AMY: "All right well I'll hold the door for both of you." And then I hold the door.

384
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,919
KRIS: "I do appreciate though that a wood elf would stop for a drow."

385
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,759
KRIS: "Because usually I get..." AMY: "Well."

386
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,779
KRIS: "It ain't the best, on the surface." KATE: "That's very inspiring, very inspiring."

387
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,420
AMY: "Well, we're not all in our element here."'

388
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,819
KATE: "I am." I go inside.

389
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,579
AMY: I say, "After you. Ma'am."

390
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:13,939
JERRY: Exactly. Now as you enter the Dran &amp; Courtier, there's a-- you feel a slight pressure change.

391
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,440
There's a temperature change from outside to inside.

392
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,500
In your inner ear you feel a little pressure momentarily, and then it's gone.

393
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:34,939
As you enter it, this seems like a perfectly serviceable opportunity to get fed,

394
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,920
make acquaintances, stay the night.

395
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,279
There's nothing remarkable about it, really at all.

396
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:51,399
Except that it is almost annoyingly... themed. It's like a theme restaurant.

397
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
AMY: Mmm.

398
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,559
KATE: Oh I love these. JERRY: Yeah, right?

399
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,960
JERRY: Over the...

400
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:04,299
To your right, you can see three chairs that you think might have been had the edges cut out of a cauldron.

401
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,860
So imagine it has sort of a high back and side placed on a stool.

402
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,980
They're radiating warmth from the fire in that corner.

403
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,860
Over the fireplace, which is itself near a very small stage, is a portrait.

404
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:37,899
A lavish, almost like gold leaf edged, portrait of a wizard in a high purple cape with a skull clasp.

405
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,940
And you recognize this person instantaneously.

406
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,799
JERRY: Not a week ago... KRIS: Right.

407
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,440
JERRY: Not a week ago, you were in the company of this sorcerer of some renown.

408
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:57,853
He's known-- he has power, but he's known to be a showman.

409
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:58,819
KRIS: Right.

410
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,399
JERRY: His name is Jim Darkmagic.

411
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,559
JERRY: And...

412
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,080
KATE: (whispers) I'm going to write that down. JERRY: But that theme...

413
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,259
(laughter)

414
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:14,160
JERRY: I mean terribly, awfully, not evilly, but annoyingly, cloyingly, extends even to the staff.

415
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:27,159
So even the staff here are adorned in a way that marks them as acolytes of some kind to this sorcerer.

416
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:38,220
They have an easier to wear, easier to wash version of his raiment. That cape-- the neck isn't quite as high.

417
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,000
KRIS: Right.

418
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:46,340
JERRY: Some of them have a wig that communicates that long black hair.

419
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:57,579
But the place is full of revelers, the bar is open, and the Dran &amp; Courtier is available for business.

420
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:00,079
KRIS: "Ah jeez. I think this is a cult."

421
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,839
(laughter)

422
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,339
KRIS: "I have great misgivings now about this." AMY: I've done it again.

423
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,819
KRIS: "I thought..."

424
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,199
KATE: Wouldn't you be excited about cults?

425
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,500
KRIS: Not this one. AMY: Not this kind.

426
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,440
(laughter)

427
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,779
KRIS: It's very lively and fun and, it's like (non-commital sound)

428
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,460
JERRY: I want a cult that has cool clothes. KRIS: Yeah.

429
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,039
JERRY: Optimally some kind of evil pact.

430
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,899
KRIS: Sure. No flair. JERRY: Right?

431
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,660
KRIS: I don't need that. KATE: I was just saying, does anybody wear flair here?

432
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,640
KATE: Are there pieces of flair?

433
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
JERRY: Some have apparently collected different kinds of skulls. Maybe there are seasonally available skulls.

434
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,179
KATE: Mmhmm.

435
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,839
JERRY: They all seem-- RYAN: I hate Mondays skull.

436
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,480
JERRY: They all seem very excited.

437
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:46,440
You see a young woman-- a young halfling woman take the stool on the small stage near the fireplace,

438
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:56,319
tune the lute very quickly and then sing a song that is entirely about Jim Darkmagic.

439
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,480
KATE: "He sounds great!"

440
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,120
JERRY: From end to end the lyrics are,

441
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:03,519
"Jim, there is only him."

442
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:05,960
"I serve his every whim."

443
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,080
KATE: Jim...

444
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,539
(laughter)

445
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,980
AMY: J. I. M. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Him, whim, got it.  RYAN: Am I writing enough?

446
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:23,640
JERRY: But there is a booth near the back of this... establishment with availability.

447
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:33,080
KRIS: Now, as I-- I'm going to make my way toward that booth being-- I'm imagining it's the only open one.

448
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,220
JERRY: Yes. KRIS: And then I notice...

449
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,200
KRIS: Would you already be seated, actually?

450
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,539
RYAN: I was at the bar. KRIS: You were at the bar? Okay.

451
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:42,740
JERRY: Yeah, and you came in earlier. RYAN: Yeah.

452
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,900
KATE: I spot-- RYAN: And then I see you and I say,

453
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,259
RYAN: "I-- I don't have any more. Guy. "

454
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,819
RYAN: "I already-- I'm sorry." AMY: "I don't need any."

455
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:55,059
KATE: I've identified you as rich, and so I am at the bar next to you just trying to get you to buy me a drink.

456
00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:00,039
JERRY: His golden scales just shimmering in the light inside.

457
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,700
KATE: Yes. Beautiful.

458
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,600
KRIS: I make sure it's not actually a scale.

459
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,459
KRIS: Because that might be worth something. RYAN: It was! That was the trick!

460
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,940
RYAN: I'm not rich at all. That's the game.

461
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,440
JERRY: That's how I do it. KRIS: Well played.

462
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,920
(laughter)

463
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:20,019
KRIS: No, I make my way to the booth and... I assume you do the same?

464
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,559
Like we notice we're traveling in the same direction.

465
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:29,139
AMY: Yeah so at this point... the social awkwardness of I ushered you in and now I feel kind of responsible

466
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,700
because I might have let in a person that's not great.

467
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,220
JERRY: You might be responsible for hauling him out later.

468
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,700
AMY: But I look with pleading eyes at the matriarchal figure of Rosie leaving me.

469
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:43,200
AMY: I'm just like, "Ah." KATE: I lean over to Donaar and say,

470
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,879
KATE: "I'd like a Jim and Tonic."

471
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,640
JERRY: It's literally-- RYAN: Nice.

472
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,080
JERRY: It is literally on the menu. KATE: Yes! Yes!

473
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,599
KRIS: Incredible.

474
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,700
RYAN: And I'll say, "Two Jim and Tonics please for me and the lady."

475
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:04,779
And then I say, "What do you know about... 25% ownership of..."

476
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:06,039
(laughter)

477
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:08,940
KRIS: You just lay is out. RYAN: Just lay it out there. "By the way."

478
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,759
KRIS: "So I don't know you but I got this uh--"

479
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:14,134
RYAN: "I don't know you. Never met you. You're just a bartender. What do you know about this?"

480
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,360
AMY: I got this magical nut. RYAN: Yeah.

481
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,579
RYAN: "I got this magical nut." KATE: "Oh!"

482
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,279
KATE: Rosie brings out her magical nut, "I got one too!"

483
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,600
RYAN: "Well then you and I should talk." KATE: "What do you know?"

484
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,240
JERRY: The person behind the bar in the middle of mixing the Jim and Tonics...

485
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:37,319
says, "Oh yeah, people often meet up. People often meet their Acquisitions Incorporated contacts here."

486
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,480
"Sometimes it's even Jim Darkmagic!" RYAN: (clicks tongue)

487
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,159
AMY: (gasp) Jim Darkmagic (murmuring as an excited crowd)

488
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,900
RYAN: "Who is that?" KATE: "I've heard that name..."

489
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,580
JERRY: "Jim Dar--" RYAN: "Who is that?" &gt;&gt; KATE: "Yeah...?"

490
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:45,599
JERRY: "Jim?"

491
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:48,899
He points over toward the fireplace.

492
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,359
JERRY: "Over the top, over the top." RYAN: "Ah okay."

493
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,559
JERRY: "Not the--" KRIS: He's fire. &gt;&gt; RYAN: "So he's made of fire?"

494
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,899
JERRY: "No, no, no." RYAN: "Oh."

495
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,640
JERRY: "No, no. You've never heard of Jim Darkmagic?"

496
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,940
RYAN: "No, I can't say that I have."

497
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,299
JERRY: "Hang around here a little bit." RYAN: "Yeah?"

498
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:03,539
JERRY: "Yeah. Yeah, yeah."

499
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,659
JERRY: "You're going to learn a lot today." RYAN: "Anyway...ETA on these Jim and Tonics, buddy?"

500
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,560
(laughter)

501
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,619
JERRY: "You're going to learn a lot tonight-- Oh! Oh! Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah."

502
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,399
He puts them together. Pushes them out.

503
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,759
You can hear him humming the same song that the halfling is singing on the bench.

504
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,600
KATE: I'm also singing it now. It's really stuck in my head.

505
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,299
RYAN: "Do you know this guy?" &gt;&gt; KATE: Total earworm. RYAN:"Have you heard of this dude?"

506
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,000
KATE: "No. Never! No, but he sounds great! Look at all these people dressed like him! He must be..."

507
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,739
RYAN: "The drink's named after him taste... tastes all right."

508
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,619
KATE: "It's a good drink!" RYAN: "He's got that going for him. I guess."

509
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:38,315
RYAN: And I'm just casually flipping around my gold nut like, doop-a-doo.

510
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,700
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: Yeah okay so--

511
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:44,059
KRIS: No idea about what its import is. RYAN: No... like the importance is entirely lost on me.

512
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:45,719
KATE: We're visibly-- Can you guys maybe see us

513
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,439
KATE: like having that nut conversation? KRIS: Yeah, I see you flipping that around and I'm like,

514
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,320
KRIS: "Oh," I think, "how many other people have this?"

515
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,440
AMY: And then I go... KATE: I thought it was special.

516
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,220
AMY: "This is a Magical Day." And I pull mine out.

517
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,099
(laughter)

518
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,799
KRIS: "I don't know what that means but..."

519
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,559
AMY: And I go, "Even I know what that means."

520
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,260
KATE: Do you uh, would you say you... busted your nut out?

521
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,100
KRIS: Lame. &gt;&gt; RYAN: There we go. Yeah. JERRY: This is a family show!

522
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,559
KRIS: Lame! JERRY: Rosie Beestinger!

523
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,940
AMY: But I liked it!

524
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,599
(laughter)

525
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,759
KRIS: "I think I'm going to go see what that's about." And I go to the bar. I approach the both of you...

526
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,660
RYAN: "Dude. I said I don't got any more money, I don't know how much clearer I can be." (slurps)

527
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,339
AMY: I'm like in the back, "Uh..."

528
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,800
JERRY: Uh ah. &gt;&gt; AMY: This guy. JERRY: Ugh.

529
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,660
KATE: "I have some money." KRIS: "Are you here about the--"

530
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:32,099
KRIS: "Oh really? Hold on a second."

531
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,940
(laughter)

532
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,739
AMY: Campaign derailed!

533
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,280
KRIS: "I could use a little coin. No, are both  of you here about the franchising opportunity as well?"

534
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,660
KATE: "Yes, as a matter of fact."

535
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:48,199
AMY: I hear franchise and I am immediately up over, looking just very glower but...

536
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,619
AMY: listening intently. KATE: "This nice young dragonman"

537
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,619
KATE: "bought me a Jim and Tonic" RYAN: "I did that."

538
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:54,420
KATE: "Would you guys like a Jim and Tonic as well?"

539
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,200
RYAN: (slurps) "No. I'm good. No more." (laughter)

540
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:00,759
JERRY: Flat. RYAN: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: yeah.

541
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,920
RYAN: "I don't know how much more I have to give this dude in one day but I draw the line."

542
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,120
KRIS: "I don't--" RYAN: Out of coin and stepping over him.

543
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,079
KRIS: "I don't want to drink anything named after a necrotizing man."

544
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,074
(laughter)

545
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:16,884
KRIS: "So I'm good, I'm complete."

546
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:24,060
JERRY: You're starting to see people... groups of people are beginning to leave the establishment.

547
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,339
They're not being replaced.

548
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:34,380
You can see outside the window, it has begin to darken what you would describe as unseasonably.

549
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,559
KATE: What time of day is it?

550
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,360
KRIS: Apparently it was noon. KATE: It was noon.

551
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,680
JERRY: You came in here about noon. RYAN: It's about seven pm.

552
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,739
KATE: Okay. JERRY: It's already begun to...

553
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,320
JERRY: the shafts of light that are coming through the window have already begun to dim precipitously.

554
00:36:53,519 --> 00:37:01,119
The bartender says, "Were you supposed to meet someone here? What does it say in your...?"

555
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,779
RYAN: "Uh..." (unfurls scroll sound)

556
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,619
"I don't think so." (rolls up scroll sound)

557
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,480
AMY: What's it say in your nut, boy? KATE: "Mine says, 'Enter the Dran &amp; Courtier at noon.'"

558
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,480
KATE: "But there's no other details besides that except for this curious little nut."

559
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,000
JERRY: "Hmm." But he says,

560
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:26,279
"The closest Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is in Waterdeep."

561
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:31,619
"And I understand that the roads from Waterdeep are springtime roads right now."

562
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,279
"Which is to say that you could swim through part of them."

563
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,599
"Um."

564
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,280
"We don't have rooms here tonight but it may be a situation where you need to wait in town"

565
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:44,900
"for your contact to arrive."

566
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,460
RYAN: "Okay?" JERRY: "I would rent you a room."

567
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:53,679
JERRY: "But I don't have them. They're already rented."

568
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,500
RYAN: "Right..."

569
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,579
KATE: "Do you know of anywhere that might rent us rooms?"

570
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:04,980
JERRY: "If you head out to the main path, worst case scenario there might be somebody at the--"

571
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:13,300
"Allfaiths Shrine to take you in. But it's not a super busy time of year because of the roads. It should be okay."

572
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:17,399
KATE: "Super busy for you apparently, though. That's pretty nice for you."

573
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,519
JERRY: "Well, we have a reputation."

574
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:22,295
KATE: "I'll say."

575
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:23,759
JERRY: Absolutely.

576
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,900
A cat... perhaps the cat of this establishment-- probably not the owner.

577
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:36,000
You feel a cat sort of curl around your right leg and look up to you.

578
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:43,000
AMY: Well. I look down and I'm immediately pleased to see...

579
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,460
AMY: something not humanoid. JERRY: Some sign of life?

580
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,800
KATE: You're like way more excited to see the cat than any of us.

581
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,720
AMY: Yeah well now that I know we're not getting a room...

582
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:58,739
So I'll kneel down and look at the cat and, you know... offer it a hand like, "Can I pet?"

583
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:05,679
JERRY: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the full meal deal. Right along the side, it goes right for that cheek.

584
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,699
JERRY: Goes for the other cheek. KRIS: Oh yeah.

585
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:11,480
JERRY: People are not paying this cat the kind of attention it deserves!

586
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,119
RYAN: It's a good cat. KATE: (whispers) Cat. Good cat.

587
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,659
JERRY: This is a premium cat. Can I get a perception roll from you, Rosie Beestinger?

588
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:18,299
KATE: Sure.

589
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,519
KRIS: That's not a bad cat. RYAN: You're like...  (laughs) &gt;&gt; AMY: I'm ready.

590
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:25,800
KATE: I got a one. I'm not very perceptive about this cat. RYAN: Wow... You step on the cat.

591
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,400
JERRY: You know what?

592
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,500
KRIS: You cannot see a cat. KATE: Yeah? All right, let's do it.

593
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,619
JERRY: I would use your advantage. KATE: Okay.

594
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:33,199
AMY: Summon your friends.

595
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,000
KATE: 18. RYAN: That's quite different.

596
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,119
KRIS: What is going on with your rolls? JERRY: Now what do you got there on your percep?

597
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,199
KATE: On my perception...

598
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,000
JERRY: On your wis. KATE: I got plus two wis.

599
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:50,039
JERRY: All right. That's marvelous. You notice something odd. The chandelier in the middle of

600
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:58,119
the Dran &amp; Courtier... the pattern of candles in it are a celestial pattern.

601
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:01,559
KATE: Ooh. Is it a celestial pattern that I recognize?

602
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:09,940
JERRY: Yes. You absolutely recognize it. It is called the Homeward Star. And it literally forms a kind of triangle

603
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:16,800
and the candle nearest the door in this configuration is sort of guttering a little bit.

604
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,600
KATE: Okay.

605
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,860
JERRY: Might need to replace that. Something to consider. Something to consider

606
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:35,260
Something else that's strange is that you're used to a certain level of recognition and notoriety from halflings,

607
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:40,340
and that is not being paid to you here. You're trying not to be offended by it...

608
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,880
KATE: Trying to move past that. JERRY: You're trying to move past it but it's not...

609
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:47,559
JERRY: It's...

610
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,620
JERRY: It's uncommon. KATE: Okay. Okay.

611
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:52,839
KATE: How many halflings are in this joint?

612
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,740
JERRY: There are three. There is the performer and then there are two at a small table playing what looks to be

613
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:00,519
like a chess or checkers-type game.

614
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:04,079
KATE: Mmm. Playing game, Okay.

615
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,599
JERRY: K'thriss, I would like to get a perception roll from you as well.

616
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,039
KRIS: I'd love to give you that. I'm going to go ahead and...

617
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,759
KRIS: pop one of mine as well. JERRY: Use your juice?

618
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:14,820
JERRY: Love it. KRIS: Why not?

619
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,840
KRIS: So let's see that's a... RYAN: Heavy.

620
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,420
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. No, it's serious. KRIS: Oh that, that's going to be a 16...

621
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,179
KRIS: plus a... so it's 18.

622
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,119
JERRY: Okay.

623
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:33,699
You're drinking from the glass, and as you drain it, you notice a strange inscription...

624
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,819
through the base of the glass.

625
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,940
KRIS: Hmm. AMY: (laughs)

626
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:40,340
AMY: This place is like just lousy with like, I don't know...

627
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,700
KRIS: Those secrets. AMY: secrets.

628
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,219
JERRY: No. RYAN: I want to Detect Magic but I don't have it.

629
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:45,379
JERRY: It's bizarre. The...

630
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,500
(laughing)

631
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:56,359
the symbology at the base of it, has the Acquisitions Incorporated logo. The sigil that adorns all the papers,

632
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,920
all the paperwork that you have.

633
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,660
It says, Acquisitions Incorporated Test Market. All Rights Reserved.

634
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,060
KRIS: Is it symmetrical around the...

635
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:10,719
AMY: Hmm. KRIS: Hmm.

636
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,780
KRIS: Why conceal this?

637
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:16,300
RYAN: Are you asking me?

638
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,039
KRIS: No that's in my head. RYAN: Oh, okay.

639
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:19,980
KRIS: Otherwise I would say, "I said it..."

640
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
(laughter)

641
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:25,920
KATE: Test Market. AMY: Can I cast Speak with Animals, talk to this cat?

642
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,000
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: Assuming it's still spending time with me.

643
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,039
JERRY: Oh, it's right here. AMY: Okay.

644
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,820
AMY: I would like to do that. So I got ten minutes of quality face time with this cat.

645
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,100
(laughter)

646
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:38,759
JERRY: Exactly. You're going to have a positive experience with the cat.

647
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,000
KATE: A paws... AMY: Stop!

648
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,800
JERRY: Paws-itive experience.

649
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:44,199
JERRY: I want to see this gif.

650
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,480
AMY: Ugh. RYAN: Yeah... &gt;&gt; KATE: Jiff?

651
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,380
RYAN: Love it. KRIS: It is.

652
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,240
AMY: No. KATE: No.

653
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,039
AMY: That's for another time. I'm going to focus on this good, good cat.

654
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:52,759
(laughter)

655
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,400
AMY: Oh it hurts me. JERRY: This jood, jood cat.

656
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,940
RYAN: Yeah, animated gif. AMY: Ajree to disajree.

657
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,259
AMY: So I look at this cat and I go... I'm like, "Hello, my good feline friend."

658
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:09,979
"Tell me about this place. This is a strange place for such a good cat to be in."

659
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:17,740
JERRY: The cat says, "This is no way to become friends." And it dotters off.

660
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,880
Through legs, between tables, under chairs, to the edge of the room.

661
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,400
AMY: I'm crushed.

662
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,440
KATE: You just got big timed by a cat. RYAN: Yeah.

663
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,760
AMY: I did. It can't make time for me. KRIS: Yikes.

664
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,240
JERRY: It winds its way back... AMY: Mmm?

665
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,680
JERRY: with a mouse.

666
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,780
KRIS: Ah...

667
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,360
RYAN: Talk to the mouse! KATE: You're so lucky!

668
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:42,960
RYAN: Talk to the mouse! Can you Talk to Dead? AMY: Oh, in it's mouth or like with him?

669
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,260
JERRY: In its mouth. &gt;&gt; AMY: Gotcha. KRIS: It knows more.

670
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:53,740
JERRY: No, not together. This is not like a... a folk act... that includes a cat and a mouse. This is a gift.

671
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,460
A gift of meat.

672
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,800
RYAN: Jift? AMY: Oh my goodness.

673
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:58,900
JERRY: Shut up! AMY: Jift?

674
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,559
(laughter) RYAN: (self five)

675
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:05,639
AMY: So I reach in my pocket for something...

676
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,219
RYAN: A mouse! Your own mouse. AMY: But I don't have anything a cat would want.

677
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:11,859
RYAN: You give him the mouse as well.

678
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:18,460
AMY: Oh I pull out a feather and I do the little twist thing so it might be like tantalizing for a cat.

679
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:21,079
JERRY: Oh the mouse is dropped!

680
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,860
AMY: Great. I make this exchange and I take this dead mouse... just put it in my pocket for later.

681
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,920
JERRY: Put it in your mouse pouch? AMY: I give it a sniff. Oh yeah.

682
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
AMY: Is that a mouse in your pocket? Yeah. So it is in my pocket. And I say, "Thank you, friend."

683
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,299
JERRY: "Thank you."

684
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,600
It's...

685
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,059
AMY: It's just batting?

686
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,579
KATE: I am watching this whole exchange and nothing about it is striking me as strange.

687
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,159
JERRY: It's fine!

688
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,420
KATE: It's wonderful. AMY: Becoming a cat--

689
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,119
RYAN: I'm watching this and everything is strange and I'm getting more and more irritated.

690
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,019
(laughter)

691
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:52,300
RYAN: Because i don't know what's going on. KRIS: I'm watching it and I lean over and I say,

692
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,539
KRIS: "Are you going to finish that mouse?"

693
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:55,719
(laughter)

694
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:58,899
"You bring enough to... share?"

695
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,260
AMY: "Um..." JERRY: Extra mice?

696
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,240
KATE: You still smell terrible don't you?

697
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,619
KRIS: I probably do. AMY: So I press again with the cat

698
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,900
AMY: because, you know, I only have so many minutes--

699
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,519
JERRY: Right. "Actually cat, listen, there's not much time!"

700
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,599
AMY: There's not much time! No, no no. JERRY: You've got the paws.

701
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,420
AMY: Just holding his little paws. JERRY: Come on!

702
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,360
AMY: And I say,

703
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:25,320
"Friend, is there anything you can tell me about the strange people who inhabit this place?"

704
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,400
JERRY: "I will tell you what I know."

705
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,879
AMY: It's going to be a cat thing, but go ahead.

706
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,039
(laughter)

707
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,740
JERRY: "Whenever I go to the mousehole..."

708
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,019
"the food place..."

709
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,980
AMY: "The good place."

710
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:45,375
JERRY: "there is always a mouse."

711
00:45:46,675 --> 00:45:47,675
AMY: "Hmm."

712
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,260
AMY: Okay. JERRY: "I have no complaint!"

713
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,960
AMY: "Well I'm happy to hear about your pest problem."

714
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:01,119
JERRY: "Every time. I could get you another mouse now. That would contravene... the rules of our friendship,"

715
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,380
"but I could get another mouse very easily."

716
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,460
AMY: "Let me ask you one more thing."

717
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,800
"Is it always a different mouse?"

718
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,139
JERRY: "I've never considered it."

719
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:25,819
Winds its way over... Winds its way back, mouse firmly attached to the craw. Drops it out.

720
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,840
AMY: Okay. I am now examining both dead mice. So...

721
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:34,579
JERRY: So at the bar! Let's be very clear about what's happening here.

722
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:39,579
At the bar you have a dead, crushed mouse,

723
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:40,934
RYAN: She just...

724
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,099
JERRY: in each hand.

725
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,559
RYAN: You're staring at the ceiling.

726
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:46,139
JERRY: There's a very distinct--

727
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,619
KRIS: I'm getting hungrier by the second. RYAN: Yeah.

728
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:52,880
JERRY: there's a very distinct brown marking pattern, sort of on the haunch.

729
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,180
AMY: Sure. JERRY: On both of them.

730
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,179
AMY: Okay.

731
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:59,839
Could I do perception to gain more insight here?

732
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,079
AMY: Or is that all I need to know? JERRY: Yeah go right ahead.

733
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,559
RYAN: You're really drilling down on these mice. AMY: I...

734
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:07,519
KRIS: I'm going to cast Determine Similar Mouse.

735
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,759
(laughter)

736
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,800
JERRY: It's a, it's a 7th-level warlock ability. KRIS: Yeah.

737
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,300
RYAN: (laughing) Detect Mouse.

738
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:16,579
AMY: Oh no. It was a 13.

739
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:18,639
JERRY: Now, now Walnut, you actually have advantage.

740
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:19,519
KATE: Quite a few. KRIS: Yeah.

741
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:22,159
AMY: Oh I would like to use one of Walnut's nuts.

742
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,100
RYAN: So you're going to waste advantage on examining a fucking dead mouse?

743
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,039
AMY: I want to-- RYAN: I want to use all three advantages.

744
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,199
I'm going to really want to dig deep on these mice.

745
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:32,679
AMY: Now Ryan... RYAN: I look in their mouth.

746
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,519
AMY: Now I know that you might be a little newer to D&amp;D but this is the kind of stuff that you do

747
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:41,619
when one is presented with two potentially identical dead mice, you give it a look.

748
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:44,679
RYAN: I'm growing more and more irritated as this happens.

749
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,460
KATE: In real life? Or...?

750
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,159
RYAN: Both. This is D&amp;D?

751
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,099
RYAN: This hasn't been explained to me. AMY: That's fine. I do want to use advantage.

752
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:52,599
JERRY: Exactly. AMY: So what do I-- do I get to roll it again?

753
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:54,059
JERRY: No, no you're good. AMY: Okay.

754
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:55,440
JERRY: Brown markings.

755
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,440
AMY: They're not in like the shape of a skull or anything?

756
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,480
JERRY: No, no no. AMY: Okay.

757
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,099
RYAN: They say, "Open the backdoor."

758
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:06,619
JERRY: But both of these mice are missing the same tooth as well.

759
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,680
AMY: Gotcha.

760
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,934
KATE: This is just the same ass mouse. JERRY: This is incredibly weird.

761
00:48:10,934 --> 00:48:14,195
JERRY: This is just weird stuff. It's 100% weird stuff.

762
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:17,644
You feel a...

763
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:27,300
a set of claws on your shoulder. Nothing strange. It's not like a hellhound or something. It's typical.

764
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:33,500
There's a dragonborn. You see a green dragonborn hand sort of come around your shoulder,

765
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,400
and you hear a whisper in your ear.

766
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,340
RYAN: Okay.

767
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,120
RYAN: What do I hear?

768
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:50,400
JERRY: In your own language you hear a dragonborn woman's voice say,

769
00:48:52,284 --> 00:48:53,855
"I have a room in this inn."

770
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:57,239
RYAN: "Oh!" JERRY: "Do you know why?"

771
00:48:57,679 --> 00:48:59,359
RYAN: "Do I know why?" JERRY: "Do you know why?"

772
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,720
RYAN: "No, I would like to know why."

773
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:05,700
JERRY: "Sometimes... they say Jim Darkmagic comes here."

774
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:10,360
JERRY: "And I want to be ready." RYAN: "I heard about that guy."

775
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,159
AMY: She just wants to tell him this.  RYAN: Yeah.

776
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:16,679
KATE: I think you can get it.

777
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:19,359
RYAN: Yeah... KRIS: I'm Jim Darkmagic.

778
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,220
(laughter)

779
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:23,159
RYAN: That's me! AMY: Why that's my name.

780
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,119
JERRY: T'is I.

781
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,059
RYAN: All right, I turn around and I look. JERRY: Yeah.

782
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:30,940
RYAN: and there's actually a person there, right? JERRY: Oh yeah.

783
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,820
JERRY: Absolutely. RYAN: Okay.

784
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:41,480
RYAN: Got to make sure. A lot of kooky stuff going on in here. And I say, "Look, lady." And I unfurl my little scroll.

785
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,559
"I was told to be here at noon to meet some dude!"

786
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:51,800
And all of this weird crap's going on, and I want know who I have to meet!"

787
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,724
"Here's my nut."

788
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,579
And I go like this, in her face.

789
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,559
And I say, "Someone tell me what's going on!"

790
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:08,260
JERRY: The barman rings a bell for last call.

791
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,820
KATE: Oh god.

792
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,579
RYAN: And I say, "Hey! What's that supposed to mean?"

793
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:15,739
(laughter)

794
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:18,119
RYAN: I'm just getting more and more angry. KRIS: That was a bell code.

795
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,259
KRIS: How many times... RYAN: "Is that more magic in here?"

796
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,000
JERRY: She-- RYAN: And I say...

797
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,039
JERRY: She is like scooting away from you, like navigating the tables and chairs.

798
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:31,699
RYAN: And I say-- KRIS: Hurrying back to your room.

799
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,960
RYAN: I say, "Wait, where are you going? Hold a minute. Wait a minute."

800
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,280
JERRY: "It's-- it's fine."

801
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:40,059
And then once she gets to the bottom of the stairs, the rest of it's a run.

802
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,619
(laughter)

803
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,880
KATE: Oh.

804
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,460
JERRY: The halfling that was playing is no longer here.

805
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,360
KATE: Okay. JERRY: This place is thinning out big time.

806
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,220
KATE: And people are not being replaced because it's closing time.

807
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:54,119
JERRY: Yes. &gt;&gt; KATE: Is that what we presume? AMY &amp; RYAN: It's closing time at noon?

808
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:54,859
JERRY: That's your guess.

809
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,260
KRIS: Well something's happening. AMY: That wasn't a change of lunch shift or something?

810
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,500
JERRY: Outside it is much darker than you think is appropriate for noon.

811
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,579
KATE: Rosie's had some pretty-- I've had some pretty interesting observations.

812
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,099
I'd like to approach the two halflings that are playing the game and have a conversation with them.

813
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,380
And I'm going to speak to them in Halfling to determine if they are actually halflings,

814
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,400
or if they are some kind of weird... fiction. JERRY: How will you do that?

815
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,920
JERRY: This is-- I am fascinated by this attempt.

816
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,019
KATE: Okay. AMY: Could be full of dead mice...

817
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:26,320
JERRY: How will you do this? Yeah! It's just a big pile of dead mice.

818
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:29,539
AMY: It's mice all the way down. RYAN: And you just keep using rolls to look.

819
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:31,059
RYAN: Whoa no. KATE: Yeah.

820
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:34,519
KRIS: The grain on the bar, peculiar wood. JERRY: She'll be here all day.

821
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:37,119
KATE: Well, I speak Draconic so I heard that RYAN: CSI: Mice.

822
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,719
KATE: craziness that that lady said to you.

823
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:43,159
And I watched those two mice and they had real similar butts.

824
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:44,779
KATE: And you were like-- JERRY: Oh their butts were crazy.

825
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,440
KATE: and you were like really into these mice.

826
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,280
RYAN: Mice butts. KATE: And this guy's doing whatever he's doing.

827
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,900
KRIS: I notice everybody leave and I'm going... (sniffs) KATE: But I've got suspicions, yeah.

828
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,860
KATE: So... JERRY: Filth!

829
00:51:53,860 --> 00:52:00,420
KATE: I'd like to-- I'm going to walk slowly and with a hobble with my quarterstaff, leaning heavily on it,

830
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:05,940
and come over to thes young halflings and ask them in Halfling,

831
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,105
JERRY: Yeah I was going to say.

832
00:52:07,105 --> 00:52:10,079
KATE: "Tell me about this game you're playing."

833
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,000
JERRY: One looks up at you, furrows his brow, and then looks back down to the table.

834
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,039
KATE: Hmm.

835
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:21,359
Uh... Okay.

836
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:26,239
There's some, I guess, I'm just confirming there's whack shit going on, I don't know what I learned from that.

837
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,659
(laughter)

838
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:31,859
Can I figure out what game they are playing? Is that something that's relevant information?

839
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,700
JERRY: It is not a halfling game. I mean there's nothing specifically halfling about it.

840
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:41,379
There's nothing to indicate that it is anything in particular.

841
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,440
RYAN: What game is it? AMY: Squeeze game.

842
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,619
JERRY: You're welcome to watch them play for a little while.

843
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:52,099
KATE: Sure, I mean I don't know maybe... I don't know if I'm much into games. I'm 120 years old.

844
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:55,400
JERRY: But you were a child once. KATE: That was a long time ago.

845
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,480
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Well, you're welcome to watch.

846
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,840
KATE: I would like to talk more about the Homeward Star actually.

847
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,640
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

848
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,379
KATE: So I found this constellation in the chandelier.

849
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,460
JERRY: Yeah exactly. This is an important constellation to you.

850
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,940
This was the second constellation that your parents taught you.

851
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,920
KATE: Oh... snap! JERRY: So this is like...

852
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,400
JERRY: This is a fundamental...

853
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,500
This is a fundamental, astronomical piece of information.

854
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,420
KATE: Okay.

855
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,680
JERRY: It's baseline vital. KATE: Yeah. Okay.

856
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:33,440
JERRY: If you're not able to get home with the first one they taught you,

857
00:53:34,099 --> 00:53:39,079
if it's obscured, this fallback is always available.

858
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:45,480
KATE: So is that particular constellation something that everyone-- it's general knowledge?

859
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,920
Or is this something that's maybe only my parents taught me?

860
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:55,079
JERRY: Like I say, it would be hard to know, because you were not there for the astronomical instruction

861
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:58,239
that other halfling children received from their parents.

862
00:53:58,239 --> 00:53:59,259
JERRY: But...

863
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,240
it's a little inside baseball. It's not, like I say, it's not the first technique you'd learn.

864
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:05,919
KATE: Interesting. Okay.

865
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:07,799
KATE: So...

866
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:14,514
Rosie is suspicious as hell. Things are whack. Whackadoodle.

867
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:17,840
JERRY: Here can you toss me a perception real quick? KATE: Yeah sure.

868
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:23,500
JERRY: So they're down here playing, you're up here looking at this. Observing it. Trying to absorb it.

869
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,454
KATE: Okay that's a 16. KRIS: That's pretty high.

870
00:54:25,454 --> 00:54:26,454
AMY: Nice.

871
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:30,279
JERRY: They are literally moving the same two pieces back and forth.

872
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,800
AMY: Mmm. KATE: Huh.

873
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:36,679
KATE: Okay. This is some kind of just, magic. I'm going to--

874
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:39,379
JERRY: Yeah, at this point...

875
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,920
JERRY: they fold the board in half, KATE: Great.

876
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,980
JERRY: and begin to leave. KATE: Okay.

877
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:48,679
KATE: So my theory, that I'm going to announce to you--

878
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:50,219
JERRY: It's Westworld! AMY: We're the only people left.

879
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:52,099
RYAN: They're all robots. KATE: It's literally Westworld.

880
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:53,639
AMY: Doesn't look like anything to me. RYAN: Two timelines.

881
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:56,420
JERRY: Yeah exactly. I've been waiting to use it. RYAN: Two timelines.

882
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:00,039
KATE: Yeah. I think they're all just mouse-structures. No I think, I think--

883
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:03,019
JERRY: Heaps of mice. Heaps of mice and glue. AMY: I knew it.

884
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:04,219
RYAN: Just burlap sacks full of mice. KRIS: So that's why.

885
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:06,159
KATE: Walnut tosses the mice. I knew it! JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

886
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:12,220
KATE: I think all of this is being conjured by someone. I think that these are all hollow constructs.

887
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,360
And that we need to get the F out of this inn ASAP.

888
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,780
AMY: If only someone had prepared Detect Magic. KATE: PDQ.

889
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,920
AMY: What an oversight that was.

890
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,280
JERRY: Dun, dun, dun! Word. KATE: Yeah. Yeah.

891
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,280
KATE: But you got all kinds of magic. KRIS: No, that's one of the ones I did not take.

892
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,340
AMY: We both did not do it. RYAN: Yeah we both didn't. I can detect...

893
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,980
KATE: Well I can tell this is going to be a long and fruitful business relationship.

894
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,219
(laughter)

895
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:36,159
RYAN: Divine sense. I can see if there are any fiends. AMY: Are we the only ones left?

896
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,340
JERRY: Yeah. Ain't it them fiends. AMY: Are we the only ones left?

897
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:44,480
JERRY: Walnut. It is you and an increasingly agitated bartender.

898
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,180
RYAN: I can Intimidate the guy.

899
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:48,699
AMY: Yeah, let's find out what's going on. RYAN: I'm going to go shake this guy down.

900
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:51,319
KATE: He's the only one that's not in the mirror. Okay. RYAN: Or should I persuade him?

901
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,920
RYAN: Should I go good cop or bad cop? You want to tag team him?

902
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,840
AMY: Yes. &gt;&gt; RYAN: All right. Yeah. JERRY: It's Dungeons &amp; Dragons, motherfucker.

903
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,820
JERRY: How you want to do it?

904
00:55:58,099 --> 00:55:59,219
AMY: All right. RYAN: We'll go after-- we'll go at him.

905
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:00,480
KATE: Who's good cop, who's bad cop?

906
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,219
RYAN: We should decide this ahead of time. JERRY: Yeah yeah, work out the situation.

907
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:07,399
RYAN: "Hey, mouse girl. Let's go get this guy." JERRY: You don't want like two lukewarm cops.

908
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,699
AMY: "Oh." KRIS: Two identical cops.

909
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,679
RYAN: "Hey, Mousey."

910
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:12,639
JERRY: Hey we're police. KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

911
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,559
AMY: Yeah I look up and I see what Donaar is trying to do

912
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:22,199
and like walk over to the bar with my look at the bartender and I go...

913
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,799
RYAN: Mice still in hand. AMY: Mice still in hand and I go, "Sir,"

914
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:28,699
JERRY: "Ugh." AMY: "explain these mice!"

915
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:31,179
AMY: "Something's going on with these mice."

916
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:36,039
JERRY: "They're mice. You were playing with the cat. The cat gets mice. I don't-- have you ever seen a cat?"

917
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,980
AMY: "These are the same mice."

918
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,380
AMY: "What do you say about that?" RYAN: Then I yell. I say, (shouting) "Hey buddy!"

919
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,980
RYAN: (shouting) "You tell her what she needs to know or I'm going to go fricking crazy in here!"

920
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,960
JERRY: "I'm not a mouse-- I'm not like a mouse expert. I don't..."

921
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,980
JERRY: "spend a lot of time thinking about mice." RYAN: You got to hold me back. You got to be the good cop here.

922
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,820
AMY: I put the mice down on the bar, but just I want him to know they're--

923
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,620
JERRY: "Ah!" AMY: I just want him to know they're still there.

924
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:58,079
AMY: Then I look at Donaar and I go, "Oh let's not-- let's not scare him."

925
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,139
AMY: "Let's not scare this nice man who's--" RYAN: I go, (growl)

926
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:02,099
AMY: "let us stay here after last call."

927
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,239
KRIS: Cool off. RYAN: (deep breath) Yeah.

928
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:05,599
AMY: "Take a beat, take a beat."

929
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:09,294
AMY: "Sir. I'm sorry about my friend. Very sorry."

930
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:13,179
"But..." and I cast Charm Person?

931
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:16,559
You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range.

932
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,500
It must make a wisdom saving throw and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it.

933
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,440
AMY: Just kidding. Doesn't have advantage. JERRY: Yeah.

934
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,260
AMY: Yes. KRIS: Never.

935
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:24,799
AMY: Okay. KRIS: Always hits. Auto-hit.

936
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,240
AMY: I want to do it. Auto-hit.

937
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:27,239
RYAN: You win the game?

938
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:29,759
JERRY: You cast the spell. AMY: Mmm.

939
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:35,679
JERRY: And you've cast this spell before. You've practiced it in your own Enclave.

940
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:39,539
It's an early spell. You may have been taught this spell by your own mother.

941
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,079
AMY: She was charming. JERRY: There are...

942
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:47,299
JERRY: When you cast it you reach toward a mind.

943
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,380
You cannot find...

944
00:57:51,954 --> 00:57:54,894
You cannot find a mind to manipulate.

945
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,079
AMY: The color drains from my face.

946
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:04,500
KRIS: I hold my-- the cup I was holding aloft. With a whirl of my cloak I yell to the bar,

947
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,280
(shouting) "The jig is up!"

948
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,599
And I just wait.

949
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:12,219
KATE: Ooh. This is interesting. KRIS: And I hope that, I hope that

950
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:15,299
KRIS: the mastermind reveals him or herself.

951
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,080
AMY: Brilliant. KATE: Yeah. Okay.

952
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:25,280
JERRY: Now, he is now cowering behind the bar. He's got a bar full of witches. He's got dragons.

953
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:30,840
He's got grandmothers that seem nice but there's something fucked up about them.

954
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,780
KATE: In fact I'm going to... I'm trying to climb up and examine the chandelier more closely.

955
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,300
Potentially dangle from it.

956
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:40,199
RYAN: While we're screaming at a bartender,

957
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:42,179
RYAN: climbing on it. KATE: Because that is the directive that I've been given.

958
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:44,379
AMY: We're throwing dead animals at him.

959
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:49,299
JERRY: You reach up and try to hang on-- RYAN: Slapping dead animals around.

960
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,320
JERRY: Hold on a second.

961
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,124
So you've been given a chandelier-oriented directive.

962
00:58:53,123 --> 00:58:53,824
KATE: Correct.

963
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:55,779
JERRY: From Patrick Rothfuss? KATE: Correct.

964
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,640
JERRY: Who plays Viari. KATE: Correct.

965
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:00,400
JERRY: Okay, so I should never have put any chandeliers in here.

966
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,400
KATE: Yeah. No. RYAN: Thought that was interesting.

967
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,880
JERRY: So his chandelier disease...

968
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,800
AMY: It's contagious. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: It's a common fixture.

969
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,920
JERRY: is now spreading? RYAN: Incepted.

970
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,720
KATE: I don't have control over these things. That's just how it is.

971
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,779
JERRY: That's fine. You...

972
00:59:13,179 --> 00:59:14,379
RYAN: He wrote The Name of the Wind, he ought to know something.

973
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,119
JERRY: You get up on top of the table.

974
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:21,899
JERRY:You quick jump, grab it, and it collapses on you. KATE: Okay.

975
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:24,280
RYAN: You're dead. No. JERRY: No. You're not.

976
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,519
JERRY: You're not dead. AMY: Nice knowing you.

977
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:28,599
JERRY: You take three points of damage and you're covered with hot wax.

978
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:29,735
RYAN: (laughs)

979
00:59:29,735 --> 00:59:31,755
AMY: Nice. KATE: Thanks, Patrick Rothfuss.

980
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:34,739
JERRY: Yeah, Patrick Rothfuss, you want to fuck with my game.

981
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:38,679
RYAN: That's funny. JERRY: Only torment awaits you.

982
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:42,539
KATE: I'm covered in (shouting) hot wax? RYAN: (laughing) Love it.

983
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,739
KATE: Jeez. JERRY: Yeah now you're all waxy.

984
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:46,519
AMY: Is it beeswax? JERRY: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KATE: (gasps)

985
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,800
RYAN: Now you look at the ground. Does it form a new constellation?

986
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,880
JERRY: No, no, no.

987
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,039
(laughter)

988
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:52,880
JERRY: It's some Dan Brown shit. KRIS: Or it spells a message.

989
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,460
RYAN: Yeah! JERRY: Yeah exactly.

990
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:58,099
AMY: It's the Illuminati. JERRY: Exactly. The bartender says,

991
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:03,119
"I can provide you with rooms tomorrow! It's closed. We're closed now."

992
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,720
AMY: And I say-- JERRY: (shouting) "We're closed!"

993
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:08,039
AMY: "Donaar, wouldn't it be great if we had rooms tonight?"

994
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,779
RYAN: I just pick up a stool and I throw it over his head. It smashes above his head.

995
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,539
I say, (shouting) "It'd be great!"

996
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:15,019
(laughter)

997
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,960
KRIS: Oh my god. This is violent!

998
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,820
RYAN: This is how I intimidate people. I don't know how to intimidate someone!

999
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,480
KRIS: You could use the mechanics of the game. RYAN: Is this working?

1000
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,559
RYAN: No, it's better this way. KRIS: All right. Well...

1001
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,579
KATE: Can I try to Intimidate now that I'm all wax? RYAN: I start whipping the dead mice around.

1002
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:33,699
KATE: I got some intimidation, I could just ask him really nicely, but like scary, you know?

1003
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:37,799
JERRY: All right, he makes a break for the door. KATE: Okay I'm next to the door.

1004
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,300
JERRY: It's true. KATE: I'm going to stop him.

1005
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,340
JERRY: Yeah exactly.

1006
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,440
JERRY: So let's have a contested roll. KATE: Okay what is that? Tell me.

1007
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,579
JERRY: That is going to be you and me...

1008
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,160
It's going to be him trying to get out and you trying to grab him.

1009
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,500
JERRY: So for you that is going to be a strength test... KATE: Okay.

1010
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:58,500
JERRY: against my dexterity test and I am going to give you disadvantage on your roll, heh heh heh.

1011
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:00,860
KATE: You are a turd. KRIS: Ugh. Punitive.

1012
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,820
JERRY: I'm the worst.

1013
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,240
KATE: Okay. That's a nine. Sorry,

1014
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:05,719
RYAN: You have another-- you have more advantage for once.

1015
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:07,500
KRIS: Yeah you can enjoy an advantage. AMY: Yeah burn them.

1016
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,099
KATE: But can I-- JERRY: Not on this one. No, no.

1017
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,119
KATE: Yeah we can't do battling. JERRY: Yeah, it's not going to work like that.

1018
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:13,659
KATE: So that's going to be... AMY: Well then I don't like this.

1019
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,199
JERRY: Yeah it's garbage.

1020
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:17,980
KATE: Nine plus two... No,  I got a nine.

1021
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,420
JERRY: Okay. I have a 14.

1022
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,940
So he...

1023
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,599
he's under the bar and then he's crawling out from the side of the bar.

1024
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:32,239
And then he's pushing his way out of the door. You reach-- you grab the hem of his shirt,

1025
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:40,319
tear a little bit of it off, he pushes open the door and it is solid black, and he disappears into it.

1026
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,880
KATE: Hmm &gt;&gt; RYAN: Hmm AMY: Delightful.

1027
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,700
KATE: I did get a little bit of shirt though.

1028
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:47,000
KATE: I'm going to smell it. RYAN: We can't leave?

1029
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:50,059
JERRY: You can try. KRIS: I watch as it happens and I say,

1030
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:52,219
KRIS: "Computer, end program."

1031
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:54,199
JERRY: It doesn't--

1032
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:55,519
KRIS: That doesn't work? JERRY: No. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Nothing happens

1033
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:58,759
KRIS: Okay what I actually say is,

1034
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,719
JERRY: You can examine all this stuff.

1035
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,039
KRIS: "I think this is a new kind of franchising opportunity."

1036
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,360
"I think this is a popup inn."

1037
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,100
RYAN: Yeah?

1038
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:12,719
KRIS: "That is solely magic..."

1039
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,480
"and..."

1040
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,659
AMY: Go on.

1041
01:02:17,659 --> 01:02:20,139
KRIS: "I think we have to fight the dragon woman for the last room."

1042
01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:21,739
(laughter)

1043
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:25,379
RYAN: Yeah. Is the whole town fake or just this building?

1044
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,700
JERRY: You feel a cold wind blow in from the door.

1045
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:30,099
AMY: Oh no. RYAN: Okay.

1046
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:32,839
RYAN: Go look out it.

1047
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,120
KRIS: It's true, may I try to peek out? JERRY: Absolutely.

1048
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,599
AMY: You love the darkness. RYAN: Yeah you love the darkness.

1049
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:37,960
KRIS: I love dark.

1050
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,519
KRIS: And I love magic. KATE: You have darkvision right?

1051
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:42,400
KRIS: Yeah I have very good darkvision RYAN: I hate the dark and I hate magic.

1052
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,800
KRIS: 120 feet. What's that get me? Nothing? KATE: Dang. Woof.

1053
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,340
AMY: Spicy. KRIS: Still right at the door?

1054
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:53,039
JERRY: It is-- I mean you're welcome to examine it with your skills and spells and--

1055
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,400
KRIS: Oh I will. I'm going to-- let me try arcana.

1056
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,519
AMY: Get witchy. JERRY: Yeah, get witchy with it.

1057
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,000
KRIS: Me me take that.

1058
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,159
And I've-- Ah... I'm going to hang onto that.

1059
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:02,940
JERRY: You can. It's up to you. KRIS: Let's see how I do without it.

1060
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,579
RYAN: These are like potions in RPGs.

1061
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:05,599
JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah. RYAN: Afraid to use them.

1062
01:03:05,739 --> 01:03:08,419
KATE: Save it? &gt;&gt; RYAN: Stack of them. JERRY: But yeah don't be so afraid.

1063
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:10,139
JERRY: They've given you two. Don't be afraid.

1064
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:13,480
KRIS: All this magic is clouding... If it is magic, the darkness. I got a 12.

1065
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,500
JERRY: 12? KRIS: Yeah.

1066
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,559
JERRY: Yeah it is not a door in the classic sense.

1067
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,319
But it is not solid.

1068
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:26,519
KRIS: Oh. Then I proceed.

1069
01:03:27,335 --> 01:03:29,615
I'm going to exit this establishment.

1070
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:32,799
JERRY: As you walk through, you feel another cold snap.

1071
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,200
You feel that pressure change on your inner ear.

1072
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,139
Give me a perception roll.

1073
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,019
KRIS: Now I am going to take it.

1074
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:44,139
(laughter)

1075
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,819
KRIS: Yeah I'm going to want that. That was an eight. KATE: Good thing.

1076
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:47,980
AMY: Yeah that was good.

1077
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:50,279
KRIS: Oh god. All right, uh... KATE: Was that even worse?

1078
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,680
JERRY: Yep.

1079
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,500
JERRY: Add up your perception. Add up your stats. KRIS: All right, 14.

1080
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:02,619
JERRY: You walk through, and you enter... what appears to be the Dran &amp; Courtier,

1081
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:08,579
except there is no one in it on this side and in your pocket you feel that the acorn is gone.

1082
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,900
AMY: You're in the Upsidedown.

1083
01:04:11,659 --> 01:04:14,619
KRIS: I see. And what do I see the other direction?

1084
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,560
JERRY: You see a solid wall.

1085
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,139
KRIS: Ah okay.

1086
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,080
RYAN: We have no idea this worked.

1087
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:21,940
AMY: Bye.

1088
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:25,659
RYAN: We assumed you died. KRIS: Can I can I bang on it and go, "I got it!"

1089
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
KRIS: "I figured it out!"

1090
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:29,840
JERRY: You hear a...

1091
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:33,299
the sound of like a distant drum...

1092
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,619
AMY: "We'll he's dying." JERRY: from the door.

1093
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,820
KRIS: He's being consumed. RYAN: That's his...

1094
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:40,939
RYAN: his death rattle. Yeah. AMY: That's his death rattle.

1095
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,659
JERRY: That's his heart.

1096
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,199
He's dying now.

1097
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,720
KATE: "I'm not very attached to him." KRIS: How could you be?

1098
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,639
KATE: I don't... AMY: I...

1099
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,819
RYAN: "Although there's nothing left in this room for us, right?"

1100
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:56,480
AMY: "Also he came with an acorn."

1101
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:01,059
KATE: "That's true. And he wasn't made of total magic bullshit so..."

1102
01:05:01,059 --> 01:05:04,380
KRIS: So you're assuming that maybe out there there's a free acorn...

1103
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,640
KRIS: that I dropped as I disintegrated. JERRY: Yeah, exactly. Oh man.

1104
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:10,019
AMY: So that mean's there's another 25% for Walnut. KRIS: You could have two of them.

1105
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:12,940
JERRY: Exactly right. We are talking about a 50% stake. KATE: Make that paper girl. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Nice.

1106
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,519
AMY: And I say-- but I don't say that out loud.

1107
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,639
What I say is... I say,

1108
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:24,920
"We should, in all good conscience, go help our fellow acorn-adorned friend in whatever trouble"

1109
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,840
AMY: "he may be going through right now." JERRY: Our fellow acorn enthusiast. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

1110
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,579
KRIS: Yeah. AMY: Mmm. Fellow nut enthusiast.

1111
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:29,960
KATE: Mmhmm. AMY: Know I love them.

1112
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,079
JERRY: Nut fans unite?

1113
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,299
AMY: And then I look at Donaar and I go, "Big guy." RYAN: "Yo."

1114
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,380
AMY: "Want the honor of the first step here?"

1115
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,420
RYAN: "Ah, I don't like this magic stuff."

1116
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,840
AMY: "I know, nobody does."

1117
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,860
AMY: "Nobody does." &gt;&gt; JERRY: No one's a fan. RYAN: All right.

1118
01:05:46,195 --> 01:05:48,184
RYAN: I say, "Fine. I got to get the hell out of here."

1119
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,340
So I step through.

1120
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,559
JERRY: You bump into K'thriss Drow'b.

1121
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,000
RYAN: "Buddy, I got no more money for you."

1122
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,375
(laughter)

1123
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:00,375
KRIS: "Everywhere? Again?"

1124
01:06:01,155 --> 01:06:03,215
JERRY: This is becoming a thing. RYAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah.

1125
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:07,379
RYAN: And I look around. AMY: I look at Rosie and I go, "After you."

1126
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,519
KATE: "Sure thing!"

1127
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:10,239
AMY: And then I go through.

1128
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:14,339
JERRY: You pop through. Now there is literally no room.

1129
01:06:14,619 --> 01:06:20,980
It is you and then Donaar and then K'thriss Drow'b in a kind of conscious brick.

1130
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:26,119
That has accreted like a pearl on the inside of the door.

1131
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,160
KRIS: I was going to say, did we like telefrag each other? RYAN: Yeah.

1132
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:30,379
JERRY: No. KRIS: Like are we within?

1133
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,295
JERRY: No, there's nothing like that. AMY: We're clipping into each other.

1134
01:06:32,295 --> 01:06:33,954
JERRY: There's nothing like that. KRIS: Okay.

1135
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,320
KATE: Are our nuts gone?

1136
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,519
JERRY: Your nuts are gone. KATE: Okay.

1137
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:42,000
KATE: "Get over here and your nut'll be gone."

1138
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,860
KRIS: No they're all in.

1139
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,960
RYAN: Yeah, we're all here. KRIS: I think you were the last one.

1140
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,720
KRIS: Or, no wait. You were. So you're all in. Yeah. AMY &amp; KATE: We're all in.

1141
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:48,219
KRIS: You all followed. KATE: Nuts are gone.

1142
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,119
AMY: I'm disgruntled about that. JERRY: That's right.

1143
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:56,480
JERRY: Now this version of the inn that you see, this version of the Dran &amp; Courtier...

1144
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:03,539
looks identical to the existing one. There are simply no revelers, no bartender.

1145
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:04,800
RYAN: Is the chandelier on the ground?

1146
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,860
JERRY: No, no. The chandelier has been replaced.

1147
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,579
JERRY: It is the Homewar-- it is the Homeward Star. KATE: Homeward Star. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Homeward Star.

1148
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
RYAN: I wrote that down. &gt;&gt; AMY: Me too. JERRY: The candle... nice!

1149
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,219
JERRY: That's Dungeons and Dragons!

1150
01:07:15,219 --> 01:07:17,459
RYAN: I did it, I did it guys! AMY: You got it! You got it.

1151
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,720
RYAN: Homework, done. JERRY: The candle nearest the door is

1152
01:07:19,719 --> 01:07:20,980
JERRY: guttering just-- KATE: Guttering again?

1153
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:22,519
JERRY: Just as the last one did.

1154
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:24,599
RYAN: What about the cat? He anywhere? AMY: I love time loops.

1155
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:26,779
KRIS: Mouse count? &gt;&gt; JERRY: Yeah, exactly. RYAN: Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; AMY: Mouse count.

1156
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,880
KRIS: Quick mouse count. RYAN: How many dead mice?

1157
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,200
JERRY: Mouse situation?

1158
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:30,759
AMY: (smacks lips) Not enough dead mice.

1159
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,780
JERRY: No, yeah, exactly, no that's not for me.

1160
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,880
We're going to go back to the other place.

1161
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,380
JERRY: They had a... No... AMY: Bang on the wall.

1162
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:39,079
JERRY: Because it's a situation where it's like, if you go to Red Robin there's like...

1163
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:41,759
RYAN: dead mice in your food? JERRY: No, no. That's rare.

1164
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,955
JERRY: No, but it's like bottomless fries, that's like bottomless mice.

1165
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,460
And that was great times.

1166
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,240
JERRY: Obviously if you are a cat, that's a great situation for you.

1167
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:50,459
AMY: True. RYAN: Yeah.

1168
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:54,115
KATE: So the cat existed somehow outside the time loop? It sounds like?

1169
01:07:54,114 --> 01:07:57,074
AMY: We're not confirmed it's a time loop, I just said time loop because I love time loops.

1170
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:59,219
RYAN: I feel like it's another dimension.

1171
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:03,980
JERRY: Listen there's plenty of opportunities for us to execute some time loop scenarios.

1172
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:05,679
AMY: I do love it. KRIS: I'm assuming I lost the glass.

1173
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:07,379
RYAN: (singing Beastie Boy's Intergalactic) Another dimension, another dimension.

1174
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,900
JERRY: There's no glass. KRIS: My keepsake.

1175
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,260
JERRY: No, no exactly, exactly yeah exactly it's like a-- KRIS: Juice tumbler.

1176
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:16,260
JERRY: Well no, it comes with every drink. Obviously you get the novel glass.

1177
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:24,779
JERRY: So this-- as I've said, this place is identical except it is empty of life.

1178
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:27,099
RYAN: And we're not being... Why did we bump all into each other?

1179
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,820
KRIS: I raise my empty hand aloft and I say, "The jig is up!"

1180
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,140
AMY: Just keep trying it. KATE: "You know there might be rooms in this one."

1181
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,180
AMY: "Oh yeah no one's here so..."

1182
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,159
KATE: "Yeah, yeah, I bet they got some empty rooms." RYAN: Yeah. Can we just loudly ask if anyone's there?

1183
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,439
RYAN: Say, "Anyone here?"

1184
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,600
"Hello?" (like an echo) hello, hello...

1185
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,380
JERRY: No. It just bounces back off of the wood panels.

1186
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:47,379
AMY: "Well we can't keep at this forever." JERRY: No, no you can explore.

1187
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,239
KATE: God... RYAN: Can we go over to the front door of this place?

1188
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:51,359
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: You can play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

1189
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:58,319
JERRY: The only distinction between this inn and the last one is that where the door was is completely flat.

1190
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:02,039
KATE: Pat Rothfuss has texted me again and said... JERRY: What does he say now? More bullshit?

1191
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:04,000
KATE: He said-- &gt;&gt; JERRY: Listen, I can hurt you. RYAN: Do the opposite of what he said.

1192
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,779
JERRY: I've got 2 disadvantage.

1193
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:10,519
KATE: He says, obviously it's *this* chandelier that is the one you need to swing on.

1194
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,059
JERRY: Listen, you-- KRIS: It's like a fetish.

1195
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:12,900
JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

1196
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,579
KATE: All right. JERRY: This is Chandelierianism.

1197
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:23,239
RYAN: So what is the exact layout of this room? So it's a tavern; a bar, tables all over the place, a fireplace.

1198
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:26,159
JERRY: Exactly, Fireplace on the right. RYAN: Stairs? Loft?

1199
01:09:26,164 --> 01:09:31,800
JERRY: Exactly, stairs over to the right. So over on your right; cauldron chairs, fireplace,

1200
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,400
there is no painting of Jim Darkmagic in this version.

1201
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:35,819
AMY &amp; RYAN: Ah... KATE: What?

1202
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:39,559
JERRY: Up the stairs, you can see that there are--

1203
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,780
there's an upper landing that have sort of a half circle of rooms that goes around the top.

1204
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:45,639
RYAN: Doors? JERRY: Mmhmm.

1205
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,700
RYAN: I'm going to head up there. AMY: I would love to follow.

1206
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:50,039
RYAN: I want to go check out them doors. JERRY: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; AMY: Yes.

1207
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:51,320
JERRY: Tell me more.

1208
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:55,160
RYAN: How many doors? JERRY: Around this arc we have a total of eight doors.

1209
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:56,300
RYAN: Eight doors.

1210
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,480
RYAN: I say, "Hey--" JERRY: Is that an auspicious number?

1211
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:00,459
JERRY: Should you write it down?

1212
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:02,199
RYAN: Whoa, whoa, hey. Eight doors... JERRY: No, no.

1213
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:03,099
KATE: Nobody write it, nobody write it.

1214
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,280
RYAN: Eight divided by four means that... KRIS: One for every door...

1215
01:10:06,765 --> 01:10:07,765
RYAN: I dunno.

1216
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:10,380
KATE: Two... bees have two wings... &gt;&gt; RYAN: Amy, roll. AMY: I can't do this under pressure.

1217
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,659
KRIS: Roll for the right maths.

1218
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,859
KRIS: Roll for eight minus four.

1219
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,880
JERRY: Yeah exactly. WALNUT &amp; RYAN: Okay.

1220
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,700
RYAN: Anyone else coming up there with me? AMY: Yes.

1221
01:10:18,699 --> 01:10:19,899
RYAN: Me and you? AMY: Yes.

1222
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:21,699
JERRY: Walnut's ready to go. RYAN: All right.

1223
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:23,319
KRIS: Let's stick together.

1224
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:25,359
RYAN: Check out these doors. KATE: Don't split the party. I'm with you all.

1225
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:26,939
AMY: Let's split the party first session. RYAN: Yeah, split the party first.

1226
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:28,359
JERRY: Exactly, yeah definitely.

1227
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:29,979
KATE: That's what they say. RYAN: I specifically say, "Don't follow me."

1228
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:30,859
JERRY: You know about this.

1229
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,939
JERRY: You know about Dungeons &amp; Dragons? RYAN: You don't want to see what I'm going to do.

1230
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:34,399
JERRY: Definitely don't all do the same thing.

1231
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:36,839
Don't stack damage on enemies. You know, definitely don't do that.

1232
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,319
AMY: Don't buff each other. Don't buff each other. JERRY: Yeah, yeah so please.

1233
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:42,864
AMY: Go ahead. You're leading this charge. RYAN: Umm...

1234
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,539
RYAN: Yeah, I open the first door.

1235
01:10:45,539 --> 01:10:48,739
JERRY: Okay. So you reach down-- RYAN: The very first door at the top of the steps.

1236
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:57,599
JERRY: You see him reach for the handle, and as he does so the door... the handle opens slightly,

1237
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,320
and you can see a ring of sharp teeth...

1238
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:08,140
that clamps down on Donaar's hand. And you see the entire door flop forward.

1239
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:12,460
JERRY: Imagine a big thick, like Fruit Roll-Up. AMY: Oh yeah.

1240
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:16,079
JERRY: Imagine that the flesh of the door-- KRIS: Just goes on?

1241
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:18,220
JERRY: just holds him like this,

1242
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:26,760
and then begins to sort of roll him around near the top of the stairs. Let's get some initiative going.

1243
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:28,559
RYAN: Going to fight some doors!

1244
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,340
JERRY: Ladies and gents. AMY: So wanted to...

1245
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:34,664
AMY: Should've cast something. KRIS: I'm excited by that door.

1246
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,760
AMY: (blows raspberry)

1247
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,160
RYAN: Eight. JERRY: Ugh that's a...

1248
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:41,979
AMY: Did you add your mod-- Oh...

1249
01:11:41,979 --> 01:11:44,239
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: (laughs) You add you negative modifier.

1250
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:47,359
JERRY: Yeah. You add your negative modifier. RYAN: Eight.

1251
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:49,119
JERRY: All right, you got eight? KRIS: You ain't last.

1252
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:50,460
AMY: Walnut got a ten.

1253
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,279
JERRY: Okay.

1254
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:52,739
RYAN: I'm not last? KATE: Rosie's 15.

1255
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:57,340
KRIS: In keeping with my enjoying watching others die,

1256
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,039
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: Five.

1257
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:01,359
JERRY: Believe it or not...

1258
01:12:02,699 --> 01:12:04,059
this creature...

1259
01:12:05,539 --> 01:12:07,819
AMY: Which also has vampire teeth. JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah.

1260
01:12:07,819 --> 01:12:09,859
JERRY: Yeah, this creature goes last.

1261
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:10,979
KRIS: Hmm!

1262
01:12:10,979 --> 01:12:15,500
JERRY: Even though he did a great job... sneaking up...

1263
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,474
AMY: I love this. This is so helpful. JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah.

1264
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:22,720
JERRY: Yeah this is old school. This is how we do's it. AMY: That was good.

1265
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:27,760
JERRY: All right, Rosie. So you are on the lower part of the landing I assume?

1266
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:35,079
You see this slab, this like curtain of flesh...

1267
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:39,760
just slam down on Donaar, bring him to the ground, and start rolling him around.

1268
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,359
KATE: Okay. Am I within striking distance? JERRY: You can get there.

1269
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:47,579
JERRY: You can get there however you like. There's a railing that goes up...

1270
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:48,500
RYAN: Chandelier?

1271
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,699
KATE: Is there a chandelier up there? JERRY: (sighs) There's a chandelier...

1272
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:54,599
RYAN &amp; AMY: Don't do it, don't do it! KRIS: It's going to eat you.

1273
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,579
KRIS: Everything in here is that thing! JERRY: (laughs) Yes, yes...

1274
01:12:56,579 --> 01:12:58,159
RYAN: Yeah that's true. Don't touch anything.

1275
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,460
Rule number one! I yell from the...

1276
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,260
RYAN: (muffled) "Nobody touch anything!" KATE: "Don't touch anything!"

1277
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,720
RYAN: "The doors are Fruit Roll-Ups!" KATE: "You'll have to pay for it."

1278
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:09,039
KRIS: I put my hand on the least mouthlike part of the chandelier, so that I may find-- No, I'm good.

1279
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:10,319
(laughter)

1280
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,100
RYAN: I do a perception check for teeth. KRIS: Yeah.

1281
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,500
KATE: Okay, so there's a railing, and...

1282
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,119
JERRY: Exactly. Railing. Staircase. KATE: Okay.

1283
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:24,039
KATE: I believe that I am going to climb the railing like a tiny little monkey.

1284
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,460
JERRY: Like straight up? KATE: Surprisingly dexterous. Yes. Shockingly so.

1285
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:31,880
JERRY: I'm not surprised in the least.  KATE: You're not, but you guys are.

1286
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,819
JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah, you're like, "Hey!" KATE: Right?

1287
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:38,220
JERRY: This isn't your grandma's grandma. KATE: You're like, "Hey, look at that granny go!"

1288
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:41,280
AMY: "She's so spry!" KRIS: "That must be some kinda railing!"

1289
01:13:41,539 --> 01:13:43,079
JERRY: Goddamn! KRIS: "Wow!"

1290
01:13:43,659 --> 01:13:47,420
RYAN: Just attribute everything to what's around like, "Wow, that's got to be the shoes!"

1291
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,340
KRIS: "Yeah."

1292
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,840
JERRY: You got them pumped up?

1293
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,680
KATE: And to get within striking distance of this Fruit Roll-Up door.

1294
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,340
And can I also make an attack? Or is that my whole action?

1295
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:02,360
JERRY: Yeah absolutely, you can move there and you can attack.

1296
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:05,099
JERRY: But he is currently-- RYAN: (muffled) "I said don't touch me!"

1297
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:10,320
JERRY: He is currently sort of wrapped up in this, you know, almost amorphous...

1298
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,079
KRIS: Let him have it! JERRY: grabber. &gt;&gt; KATE: Right.

1299
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:18,460
JERRY: So some of that may come through onto your new friend.

1300
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,739
JERRY: Let's see how it goes. KATE: Okay.

1301
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:25,680
KATE: The amorphous grabber. I'm going to try to strike the non-dragon part of whatever this blob is.

1302
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,534
JERRY: I'm going to strike the least draconic part. KATE: Yeah.

1303
01:14:28,534 --> 01:14:31,364
RYAN: I appreciate that. That is appreciated by me. KATE: Whatever looks least draconic to me.

1304
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,579
JERRY: I want to register my satisfaction. RYAN: Yeah.

1305
01:14:34,579 --> 01:14:36,460
KATE: Okay. RYAN: I cheer you on.

1306
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,079
AMY &amp; KATE: (muffled) Yay!

1307
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,500
KRIS: I will not be doing you that kindness.

1308
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:43,739
KATE: I got a 24. JERRY: Jeez.

1309
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:44,880
AMY: Woo! KRIS: Mamma mia.

1310
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,819
KATE: Apizza. JERRY: Yeah that's real good.

1311
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:48,739
JERRY: Hit it! KATE: Okay.

1312
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:51,914
KATE: So then I got a d8. KRIS: Which one are you doing?

1313
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,319
KATE: I'm going to do, well I'm doing-- KRIS: Just a quarterstaff?

1314
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:55,019
JERRY: You're going to whack it with the quarterstaff? KATE: I'm whacking it with my,

1315
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,700
KATE: I get up there with my quarterstaff and I'm just going to go, "Wah-pah!"

1316
01:14:57,975 --> 01:15:00,685
KATE:  Right in it, which is a... JERRY: Just with the back!

1317
01:15:00,685 --> 01:15:01,685
KATE: Seven.

1318
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:06,660
And then also, because I am fluent in martial arts...

1319
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:09,420
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. In the martialest. KRIS: In the language of the quarterstaff.

1320
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,935
KATE: Yes, in the language of the quarterstaff.

1321
01:15:10,935 --> 01:15:12,260
JERRY: The dialectic!

1322
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:15,659
KATE: As a bonus action I can take an unarmed strike.

1323
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:16,639
JERRY: Woo! KRIS: Oh, nice!

1324
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,300
KATE: And in addition to that, I'm just going to go-- let's just go all in, folks.

1325
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:26,180
RYAN: I'm glad I'm giving you the chance to show off with my incompetence of grabbing doors.

1326
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,520
RYAN: I asked for this. KATE: I can also...

1327
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,500
KATE: I'm going to spend a ki point and engage my flurry of blows.

1328
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,720
Which means that I can go,  "Wah-pah," with the quarterstaff

1329
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,780
and then with my two little feet, go "Chop chop!"

1330
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:40,239
AMY: Chop with the feet? &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah, yeah. JERRY: Oh, nice! &gt;&gt;  KRIS: Oh, like a cat!

1331
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,804
RYAN: A foot chop?! KATE: Yeah yeah, it's a foot chop, it's a foot chop.

1332
01:15:41,805 --> 01:15:43,240
AMY: That's how you know she's good. KATE: It's a monk thing.

1333
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:45,579
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't know about it. KATE: Yeah yeah, it's a big deal.

1334
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:49,135
RYAN: Your little toes bend like... KATE: So that's a six.

1335
01:15:49,539 --> 01:15:52,039
KATE: And... JERRY: Jeez.

1336
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:53,600
KATE: a five.

1337
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,960
KATE: So total of... KRIS: Wow.

1338
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,340
KRIS: You're dead!  JERRY: 18.

1339
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:57,400
KATE: 18, okay. (laughter)

1340
01:15:57,979 --> 01:16:00,659
AMY: That's what happens when you buy her a drink. KATE: On all the non-dragony parts.

1341
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:02,000
JERRY: Brutal. RYAN: (muffled) "I owe you another drink!"

1342
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,380
KATE: I haven't even started breathing hard, RYAN: "As many Jim &amp; Tonics..."

1343
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,140
KATE: I'm just like, "Chop chop!"

1344
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,220
I'm just like waiting to see--

1345
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,760
KRIS: Right, you do it with the same-- RYAN: Surgical precision.

1346
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,500
KRIS: the same motion that you used to climb the banister.

1347
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,319
AMY: (laughs) Oh god!

1348
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:14,460
KRIS: It just rolls immediately into those moves! KATE: (laughs) &gt;&gt; JERRY: Yeah, yeah!

1349
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,159
KRIS: They're indistinguishable. JERRY: It's one thing.

1350
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:19,460
JERRY: All three of these hits is like within a second and a half.

1351
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,939
KRIS: Right. JERRY: Right?

1352
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:26,320
JERRY: Absolutely. That is an incredible debut from this dangerous grandmother.

1353
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:28,439
Next up is Walnut Dankgrass.

1354
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:30,379
AMY: Hmm. RYAN: It's not dead yet?

1355
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:33,420
JERRY: No! &gt;&gt; AMY: So... KRIS: It's got a good grip.

1356
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:34,859
RYAN: Ugh. AMY: (sighs)

1357
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,960
AMY: Hoo boo booey...

1358
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:38,839
What do I want to do.

1359
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,900
KATE: "Hoo boo booey," is a great battle cry, by the way. JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah!

1360
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:42,979
RYAN: Yeah! JERRY: Write it down, obviously.

1361
01:16:42,979 --> 01:16:44,479
JERRY: Yeah, we're still building the brand, you know...

1362
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:46,199
KRIS: It's going to be on all the shirts. KATE: Yep! Got to get those at--

1363
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:47,399
AMY: I... RYAN: "Hubba booey."

1364
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:51,199
AMY: would like to-- just because I don't feel...

1365
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,260
comfortable in my ability to, like... pull you out of this?

1366
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:01,939
This happens right in front of me, and I look at this like, "So much is happening right now."

1367
01:17:01,939 --> 01:17:07,119
So I would like to touch Donaar and use Barkskin?

1368
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:08,585
KRIS: Hmm!   KATE: Hmm!

1369
01:17:08,585 --> 01:17:12,939
AMY: So I touch a willing creature--  We'll just... assume. KATE: He's willing. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

1370
01:17:12,939 --> 01:17:14,259
JERRY: You reach under for his... RYAN: (shouting) "Who's touching me?!"

1371
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,220
RYAN: (shouting) "I don't agree to this!" JERRY: his foot!

1372
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,340
KRIS: "No touch!"

1373
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,319
RYAN: "No-no touch!" AMY: Just real quick.

1374
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:24,980
AMY: Until the spell ends, target's skin has a rough, bark-like appearance-- so scales,

1375
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:28,759
and the target's AC can't be less than 16 regardless of what kind of armor it's wearing.

1376
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,980
KRIS: Hmm! KATE: Nice.

1377
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:32,699
JERRY: Oh, wow! &gt;&gt; AMY: So.. KRIS: The bark sloughs off...

1378
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:34,380
KRIS: with a gnash of the teeth!   AMY: I think that maybe doesn't do anything for you...

1379
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:37,039
RYAN: My AC's 18. &gt;&gt; AMY: Oh. Well... KATE: That's all this door needs.

1380
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:39,600
AMY: So you look like bark. KRIS: It just loves bark! &gt;&gt; JERRY: Exactly!

1381
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,920
KRIS: It's its favorite flavor. RYAN: I look like bark wearing stronger armor than bark.

1382
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,440
AMY: I made you hideous and you're getting eaten by a door.

1383
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:47,159
KRIS: (yells in horror)

1384
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:48,579
RYAN: (shouting) "Nobody look at me!"

1385
01:17:48,579 --> 01:17:50,800
JERRY: So here's what's happened... AMY: Thank you.

1386
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:57,460
JERRY: You are a young druid... and sometimes you get excited.

1387
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,260
AMY: It happens to a lot of people! JERRY: Yeah, exactly, happens to a lot!

1388
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:07,840
JERRY: So you confer upon Donaar an effect that makes his flesh like armor inside of his...

1389
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,360
armor, which is also armor.

1390
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:13,079
KATE: I'm going to give you two thumbs up. I loved it.

1391
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:15,819
AMY: And then I would like to use my move action to just...

1392
01:18:15,819 --> 01:18:17,019
JERRY: To be ashamed!

1393
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,640
AMY: just back up and ashamed a little bit!

1394
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,980
(laughter)

1395
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:21,420
RYAN: I just start turning into bark and say,

1396
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,220
RYAN: "What is happening? Who is it?" JERRY: "Why?"

1397
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,220
RYAN: "Is this the door? Is the door doing this?" KRIS: Right!

1398
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,500
JERRY: You don't even know! KRIS: "Itchy! Flaking! Ah, ah..."

1399
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,800
JERRY: All right. Donaar Blit'zen!

1400
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:36,180
Welcome to your very first ever combat in Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

1401
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:37,039
KATE: (gasps) Aww!

1402
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:39,439
RYAN: The one where I died via door. JERRY: That's right.

1403
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:41,379
KRIS: Well, you didn't have to grab it.

1404
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,900
JERRY: No, it's like this-- RYAN: I didn't have to grab a door? Wha...

1405
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:44,659
JERRY: You fucked up!

1406
01:18:44,659 --> 01:18:47,039
RYAN: I'm going to slow every game down from now on,

1407
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,319
where I meticulously check to make sure it's not a monster.

1408
01:18:49,319 --> 01:18:50,799
AMY: That is the game! KATE: That's the game!

1409
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,199
KRIS: That's what people do! KATE: That's Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

1410
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,279
KRIS: That knob was its genitals.

1411
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:56,199
(laughter)

1412
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,359
KATE: You'd bite you too! KRIS: And it's so angry!

1413
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:00,380
RYAN: I'm so perturbed with this room. JERRY: No, it's not angry.

1414
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,900
JERRY: Like that is a positive experience. AMY, KATE, &amp; KRIS: Oh...

1415
01:19:02,899 --> 01:19:05,079
KATE: Oh, this is a mating ritual. JERRY: You're going to have to marry this door!

1416
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:07,340
RYAN: Well I'm okay with that! KATE: Mazel tov!

1417
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,760
KRIS: It wasn't the grasp, it was the turn. RYAN: What's the dowry like from a door?

1418
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,820
JERRY: So you marry... &gt;&gt; KATE: A doory? JERRY: It's just hinges. It's like it's easy.

1419
01:19:13,819 --> 01:19:16,579
AMY: Skeleton keys. JERRY: It's a huge timesaver for you.

1420
01:19:16,579 --> 01:19:19,760
RYAN: Yeah, no that's fine! JERRY: It's like if you were to try to marry...

1421
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,820
JERRY: a dragonborn woman... Very complicated! RYAN: Yeah.

1422
01:19:22,819 --> 01:19:24,380
KRIS: No, no, no!  RYAN: Yeah, I don't want to go through that.

1423
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,239
JERRY: No, no.

1424
01:19:25,239 --> 01:19:27,819
KATE: Hassle. KRIS: If you carry the door over the threshold

1425
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:28,779
KRIS: (clicks tongue) that's your door!

1426
01:19:28,779 --> 01:19:30,340
KATE: There it is. &gt;&gt; KRIS: In your house. JERRY: Just install it!

1427
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:32,140
KRIS: It's just done. RYAN: Carry a door through a door, that's...

1428
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:35,020
KRIS: It's a great door. &gt;&gt; RYAN: that isn't good. AMY: Is this a bit, or is this guy marrying a door?

1429
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,940
JERRY: No, exactly! So, as a-- KRIS: Fast forward! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

1430
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,559
RYAN: That's Dungeons and Dragons!

1431
01:19:38,939 --> 01:19:41,500
JERRY: As your basic action for this turn...  RYAN: Yeah.

1432
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,920
JERRY: You can marry this-- No. (laughter)

1433
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,060
RYAN: Roll to propose! AMY: Ah.

1434
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,460
JERRY: No, no, exactly! You do.  KRIS: Right.

1435
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,960
JERRY: So your charisma's very high.

1436
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,020
JERRY: The fact of the matter is, RYAN: It is!

1437
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,760
JERRY: you could probably fucking marry a door, and no one would bat an eye.

1438
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,060
JERRY: So, Donaar, KATE: I can officiate.

1439
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,280
JERRY: She's ready to go.

1440
01:19:56,279 --> 01:20:01,439
Donaar Blit'zen. You are grappled by this door.

1441
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,680
Well it's more of a liquid creature now.

1442
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,079
RYAN: A fruit leather door. JERRY: Exactly.

1443
01:20:05,079 --> 01:20:09,079
JERRY: So a grappled creature's speed becomes zero, you can't really move around.

1444
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:11,159
You can't get bonuses to your speed...

1445
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,360
But basically you need to use your own strength

1446
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:21,639
to sort of peel-- again, the Fruit Roll-Up metaphor is continuing to be strong.

1447
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,520
RYAN: "It's quite the sticky situation!"

1448
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,400
KATE: God! We can't hear you! AMY: (blows raspberry)

1449
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:28,059
JERRY: So peel it off. KATE: You're covered in-- &gt;&gt; RYAN: I say it to the door.

1450
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,060
KRIS: It's to himself. RYAN: The door hears me. (laughter)

1451
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,440
KRIS: The door chuckles. RYAN: And it's smitten! It loves me more!

1452
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:33,579
JERRY: (muffled sounds)

1453
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,200
JERRY: So your beak is just like rasping against the side of this thing.

1454
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:40,260
RYAN: I'm just saying tons of funny shit and this door is loving it.

1455
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,680
KRIS: All my good material is getting absorbed by this damn door!

1456
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:48,480
JERRY: Yeah, so before you can-- RYAN: I make a note to say it later.

1457
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:55,100
JERRY: Before you can do much, you want to get the fuck away from this door.

1458
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,220
RYAN: Yes, I do. I want to... withdraw myself. JERRY: Right? So there's a couple things.

1459
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,960
JERRY: Checks. This specific type of creature is extra hard to escape,

1460
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,020
you get disadvantage trying to get away from it.

1461
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,260
But you could very easily leverage your advantage to make it a straight roll.

1462
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,920
RYAN: Yeah, I will do such a thing. JERRY: Now, is this the sort of thing that

1463
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:15,220
JERRY: systemically brings you around? RYAN: Yes.

1464
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,520
RYAN: Now, what do I have to do to... What am I rolling, strength?

1465
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:21,159
JERRY: Exactly. So this is basically an ability check.  RYAN: Yeah. Okay...

1466
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:24,059
JERRY: So you're looking for a DC 13...

1467
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:29,479
JERRY: Here's your strength. RYAN: Yep. 16, with a plus three modifier.

1468
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:32,579
JERRY: Exactly. So you roll a dice, you get a plus three, these are good times!

1469
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:33,380
KRIS: See what you get.

1470
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:34,600
RYAN: What am I rolling? d20?

1471
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,200
JERRY: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah! d20!

1472
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:36,840
KRIS: Yeah, we love them.

1473
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,860
JERRY: Most of the-- if I ever ask you for a check--

1474
01:21:38,859 --> 01:21:39,880
RYAN: 11. JERRY: No!

1475
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,800
KATE: No!

1476
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,360
JERRY: If I ever ask you for a check...

1477
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:44,659
RYAN: It's always 20? All right.

1478
01:21:44,659 --> 01:21:47,300
JERRY: Grab that 20. RYAN: I got another one, can I do it again?

1479
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,659
JERRY: No, not right now. So that's your action for this turn is trying to get the fuck away.

1480
01:21:50,659 --> 01:21:53,300
KRIS: You're getting an embrace of the door. KATE: You got to add a bunch of stuff to that, right?

1481
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,560
KATE: Add all kinds of stuff! JERRY: Yeah!

1482
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,380
RYAN: 14!

1483
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,400
JERRY: 14 is one over what you need. AMY: Mmm. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Oh!

1484
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:07,699
JERRY: So you sort of reach inside, you push out just far enough, and then you just remove it like a heavy cloak.

1485
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:14,125
You just peel it off and snap it like a towel. And throw it a few feet down the hall...

1486
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:16,500
JERRY: And then stand up like, "It's cool." RYAN: And then I say...

1487
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,159
RYAN: "That was a sticky situation!"

1488
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:20,340
JERRY: (laughing) I've been saying it the whole time!

1489
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:22,659
RYAN: "Yeah! Guys. Did you see that?"

1490
01:22:22,659 --> 01:22:25,899
KATE: "I love it, I love it, I love the joke." KRIS: I'm like, "I heard it, those three times you said it."

1491
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:28,420
KATE: "I didn't." KRIS: "And you intonated differently each time."

1492
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,480
RYAN &amp; KATE: Yeah! AMY: Just workshopping it.

1493
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:32,259
KATE: You heard it because of your excellent hearing.

1494
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:34,820
RYAN: And then I make a point to thank Rosie... KRIS: I have dark hearing.

1495
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:35,939
KATE: Yeah. RYAN: And...

1496
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:38,439
AMY: That's a bonus action. RYAN: I look at Walnut...

1497
01:22:38,439 --> 01:22:40,639
RYAN: and I just don't say anything. KATE &amp; KRIS: Yeah.

1498
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,380
RYAN: I don't admonish, and I don't thank. AMY: "Is that a butterfly?"

1499
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,920
KATE: Just a long stare... RYAN: And I just scratch my barky skin.

1500
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,199
JERRY: Yeah, it's just neutral. No, no, it's like birch!

1501
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,239
It's just you're peeling off sheets of it... AMY: Ew. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

1502
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:51,119
JERRY: All right, K'thriss Drow'b. AMY: "Exfoliating, whatever."

1503
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:53,019
JERRY: Yeah, exactly! Exactly. AMY: "You're welcome."

1504
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,520
JERRY: You're revealing skin's freshest layer!

1505
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,640
All right. Take it away, K'thriss Drow'b.

1506
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,740
KRIS: I'm going to nail this door. And I'm going to take aim at all the other doors.

1507
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:02,880
Show them a lesson. We're going to--

1508
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,340
KRIS: "No shit from you," RYAN: You're going to beat it up,

1509
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:05,760
KRIS: "the seven of you!" RYAN: "This is for the rest of you doors!"

1510
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,100
KATE: Oh, there's seven other doors!

1511
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:10,739
KRIS: I am going to... JERRY: So where are you physically in this scenario?

1512
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:13,279
JERRY: Because you and Rosie were sort of down on the lower landing.

1513
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:17,239
KRIS: Oh okay, yeah. I take my time carefully up the stairs.

1514
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,079
Although I am dextrous, no need to put myself out.

1515
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:24,119
RYAN: (laughs) AMY: Not a showboater.

1516
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:27,539
KRIS: So that puts me... I guess furthest in the back.

1517
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:29,319
Oh, no! You advanced on this thing.

1518
01:23:29,319 --> 01:23:31,079
KATE: Mmhmm.  KRIS: You were basically on top of it. Okay.

1519
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,720
KRIS: Where are the two of you? Yeah, we're-- So down the hallway...

1520
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,140
JERRY: Mmhmm. KRIS: we're now situated here...

1521
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,579
JERRY: Just half-circle, up the stairs, KRIS: and they've been thrown--

1522
01:23:39,579 --> 01:23:42,479
JERRY: they are farther up, they're about in the middle of this ring here.

1523
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,859
She has already approached and has interacted with these creatures.

1524
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:47,839
KRIS: Okay.

1525
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,340
JERRY: But it is now a couple feet past them around this ring.

1526
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,480
KRIS: All right. I just want to get close enough to get line of sight so I can Eldritch Blast them.

1527
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,539
So let's do that.

1528
01:23:56,539 --> 01:23:58,500
JERRY: So you want to blast them in an eldritch way?

1529
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,859
KRIS: Yes. JERRY: Okay.

1530
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:02,659
KRIS: It's the preferred method of my people. JERRY: Prove it. Now how does that work?

1531
01:24:02,659 --> 01:24:07,079
JERRY: So your focus is this chunk of this altar that you carved out.

1532
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:11,220
KRIS: I reach into my cloak and thank the gods I still have it.

1533
01:24:11,979 --> 01:24:15,359
KRIS: I didn't take that over my acorn. I don't care about that!

1534
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,720
KATE: Which gods do you thank?

1535
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:23,060
KRIS: Oh... I only say that as a nicety. I only believe in the real, actual one.

1536
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,520
KRIS: The darkest, sub-one. RYAN: "I say it as a nicety."

1537
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,660
KRIS: Yeah. People say, oh you're atheist but then why do you say thank god?

1538
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:30,599
Because everybody says it! It's part of our language.

1539
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,920
(laughter)

1540
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,260
AMY: Ugh!

1541
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:37,180
KRIS: I give it a little (kissing sound) mwah-mwah kiss, as is traditional,

1542
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,820
that I've discovered enhances its power.

1543
01:24:38,819 --> 01:24:40,699
JERRY: Yeah, exactly, a moistening.

1544
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:43,960
KRIS: Yeah, yeah. It requires saliva to function.

1545
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:49,460
And then I lower one arm at this flopping thing.

1546
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,399
AMY: I'm so transported.

1547
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,740
KRIS: (straining) Ah... Ho! What's that?

1548
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:56,260
JERRY: Do you know about numbers? KRIS: That's nothing!

1549
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,579
KRIS: No, no, that's pretty good. KATE: Bringing your shitty little game....

1550
01:24:57,579 --> 01:24:59,199
KRIS: That's going to be a... 15! KATE: to my table.

1551
01:24:59,199 --> 01:24:59,939
JERRY: Yep, yep. KATE: Mmm!

1552
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:04,199
JERRY: So these... razor sharp...

1553
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:05,039
KRIS: (hisses)

1554
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:07,659
JERRY: bursts of eldritch power leap out of the stone.

1555
01:25:07,659 --> 01:25:10,039
What kind of damage are we talking about, K'thriss Drow'b?

1556
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:14,699
KRIS: We're talking about a tender, choice, juicy 1d10.

1557
01:25:14,699 --> 01:25:15,920
(laughter)

1558
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,340
KRIS: It's like a filet mignon junior! RYAN: Roll a ten!

1559
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,880
KRIS: A four.

1560
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:22,879
KRIS: A four. KATE: Oh, just four damage, huh?

1561
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,400
KRIS: Just four. JERRY: Yep. &gt;&gt; KATE: Mmm.

1562
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:27,279
KRIS: It don't do so much at level three.

1563
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:28,359
(laughter)

1564
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:31,859
JERRY: It impacts this, sort of meaty shroud...

1565
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:32,979
KRIS: (sound like damp cloth being vacuumed) "phthlm!"

1566
01:25:32,979 --> 01:25:35,899
JERRY: but is largely absorbed by the creature.

1567
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:46,760
Next up, this beast begins to slither and writhe along the ground and next it's going to leap up...

1568
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,760
onto Walnut Dankgrass.

1569
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,960
AMY: Okay. Cool.

1570
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,039
AMY: Learned my lesson. RYAN: Yeah.

1571
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:56,439
KATE: Mmhmm. AMY: About being squishy.

1572
01:25:56,439 --> 01:26:00,839
JERRY: Right. So as it comes up, you can see the mass sort of slithering toward you.

1573
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:08,460
It sort of grows in height the closer it gets. Never quite becoming humanoid.

1574
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:16,100
But it's surprising, because as it approaches a pseudopod lashes out from an unexpected arc.

1575
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,760
AMY: Great! Okay... JERRY: It has no shape of any kind.

1576
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:22,659
AMY: That's how I like my pseudopods?

1577
01:26:22,659 --> 01:26:25,760
JERRY: (laughs) "I like my pseudopods like I like my other things."

1578
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,780
KATE: Without form. JERRY: Amorphous!

1579
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:31,200
KRIS: My ears perk up. JERRY &amp; KRIS: (noises of interest)

1580
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,859
JERRY: Nine, I assume, is not your...

1581
01:26:33,859 --> 01:26:35,259
AMY: Oh, no. JERRY: Yeah.

1582
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,440
AMY: I dust it off. JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

1583
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:39,319
KATE: Phew AMY: "Nice try."

1584
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:43,939
JERRY: Yeah. It tries, you just easily come underneath it.

1585
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:48,000
JERRY: We're back on to Rosie Beestinger. KATE: Okay.

1586
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,600
JERRY: So Rosie Beestinger has been the greatest contributor of damage thus far in this scenario.

1587
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,140
KATE: It's not too late. JERRY: Yeah!

1588
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:02,980
KATE: Okay.... Rosie is... she has followed this thing as it has slithered across the floor...

1589
01:27:02,979 --> 01:27:04,599
KATE: She's got-- JERRY: Just tracking it?

1590
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,960
KATE: Yeah yeah, she's like, "Just move!" JERRY: Just the rod out?

1591
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,640
KATE: "Just try something right now."

1592
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:13,640
She's got her stick out and she's waiting for everybody else to do their thing.

1593
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,680
And then she's just going to go at it again. She's got no trust for this thing,

1594
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,020
It went after her dragon friend who bought her a Jim &amp; Tonic.

1595
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,040
And she's just like,

1596
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:24,260
"If there's one thing in this life that you can trust, it's someone who buys you a goddamn drink."

1597
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:26,159
So that's why she is all about--

1598
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:28,159
JERRY: She's about it. &gt;&gt; AMY: Wise beyond her years. KATE: ridding the world of this...

1599
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:30,800
RYAN: We're best friends! JERRY: Well, pretty old. &gt;&gt; AMY: But not beyond.

1600
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,020
JERRY: Wise at exactly the right amount for her age. AMY: (laughs) Yeah!

1601
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,420
JERRY: So you come up, classic technique. KATE: Yeah.

1602
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,119
JERRY: You've known this for... 80 years.

1603
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:41,960
KATE: Yeah, it's not-- It's like breathing. It's like water.

1604
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,880
And it's going to be...

1605
01:27:45,524 --> 01:27:46,524
a... AMY: (whistles)

1606
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,820
KATE: Hmm that's an 11 to attack?

1607
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,880
AMY: Well, not quite like breathing... KATE: (whimpers)

1608
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:59,440
JERRY: You can see that it's lashed out with its pseudopod at Walnut. You time your strike perfectly and

1609
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:03,179
as immediately as you put it through, it makes a void.

1610
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,180
KRIS: Mmm. &gt;&gt; KATE: Ah.  AMY: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KATE: The void.

1611
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:07,880
JERRY: Goes through. You withdraw it. KATE: Void's stuffed. Okay.

1612
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,399
KATE: Then I don't know that I can do much about that.

1613
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:17,920
I can do-- I can take a bonus action of kicking...

1614
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,579
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You should always KATE: As I always do.

1615
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:21,680
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1616
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,000
AMY: Why wouldn't you? JERRY: Let's having kicking be your thing.

1617
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,800
JERRY: Because you know, everybody has to have a thing, like maybe your thing will be kicking monsters.

1618
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,960
RYAN: Oh, are we doing things?

1619
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,359
KATE: Yeah, yeah. My thing will-- JERRY: Everybody work out their thing!

1620
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:31,880
KRIS: Choose your thing! JERRY: No, when I come to your turn

1621
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,520
RYAN: I spit acid. JERRY: you better have your thing worked out.

1622
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,079
AMY: Okay. KATE: It creates that void, and I'm like,

1623
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:39,019
KATE: "Oh yeah, you can't do it twice! You can't do it in two places!"

1624
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:41,239
Oh, sorry, I rolled the wrong thing.

1625
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:42,939
JERRY: You get excited by the damage! You're like-- KATE: (grunting) I just--

1626
01:28:42,939 --> 01:28:45,819
JERRY: "I want to roll it again!" Hey, no real quick, KATE: I already did it!

1627
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:52,400
JERRY: Don't forget so next time... on an attack... people watching the show, they want you to succeed...

1628
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:56,339
KATE: Yeah. Sorry. Yes. I'm very-- I'm in it! I'm in that place.

1629
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,220
JERRY: But that connects. That's a gruesome hit. KATE: Oh yeah, that's a 21.

1630
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,980
KATE: Okay. And that is going to be...

1631
01:29:02,539 --> 01:29:05,640
a... five damage with my foot. With my little granny foot.

1632
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:14,840
JERRY: So it looks from your perspective, this looks completely planned. She's fired the quarterstaff in.

1633
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:22,659
It's made the space, and it's thickened it over here, for the direct blade kick right along the side of the foot.

1634
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,435
More damage from Rosie, now it's back to Walnut Dankgrass.

1635
01:29:27,579 --> 01:29:29,939
AMY: This situation is unbearable.

1636
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:32,319
JERRY: Yeah!   KATE: Oh no...! JERRY: Oh no!

1637
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:33,899
KRIS: (victory airhorn noises) KATE: It's happening! &gt;&gt; RYAN: (quacks)

1638
01:29:33,899 --> 01:29:38,479
AMY: So I use wildshape to turn myself into a brown bear.

1639
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:41,119
RYAN: Oh. I thought you were going to say, "into a dire wolf."

1640
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:44,840
AMY: No, there's different puns for every... thing!  KATE &amp; KRIS: (growls)

1641
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,199
JERRY: Now we worked this out.

1642
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:48,539
AMY: Yes. JERRY: There's cool phrases for each beast.

1643
01:29:48,699 --> 01:29:52,500
JERRY: Right? "Unbearable". Love it. What's next?

1644
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:59,720
AMY: Okay. So I can start out by giving it giving it a chomp. Giving it a bite.

1645
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,680
JERRY: Yeah yeah. So you you become a bear.

1646
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,320
AMY: I become-- Oh sorry! I am now a brown bear.  JERRY: Yeah.

1647
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:07,340
KATE: Is there any pomp and circumstance to it?

1648
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:11,079
Or are you just like one minute you're-- It's just a blink-- like, I'm just a bear now!

1649
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:17,399
AMY: I mean she looks angry and then she hulks out. Yeah there's a cutscene. This is theater of the mind!

1650
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:19,299
KATE: Roleplay this shit for me right now.

1651
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:22,199
JERRY: Altered beast. AMY: (growling)

1652
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:23,739
(laughter)

1653
01:30:23,739 --> 01:30:26,859
(laughter) KRIS: It's more like... (growls)

1654
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,200
AMY: Or it's almost the closeup shot of the hand like getting all gross.

1655
01:30:30,199 --> 01:30:32,399
RYAN: Stretching and reforming, yeah. JERRY: All the hair...

1656
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:34,760
KRIS: An American Bear in Paris. RYAN: An American Werewolf... Yeah there you go.

1657
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:40,140
JERRY: So it sounds like Walnut Dankgrass is just cracking her knuckles...

1658
01:30:40,699 --> 01:30:48,019
It sounds like she's just cracking her knuckles, but she is transformed into a gigantic, starving bear.

1659
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:50,640
AMY: I would also...

1660
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:52,880
JERRY: Starving ass bear! AMY: Starving ass bear!

1661
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,199
AMY: I want to do a bite, but I don't want to mess around because I really want to redeem myself

1662
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:02,359
because Walnut, and maybe the human playing Walnut, are very embarrassed about that first attack.

1663
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:06,359
JERRY: Hey! Worse things have happened. So you're saying you want to dump one of your dice into there?

1664
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:08,899
AMY: I want to dump one of my special dice.

1665
01:31:08,899 --> 01:31:11,694
AMY: Thanks guys  JERRY: So two rolls, and choose your best.

1666
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,780
RYAN: There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

1667
01:31:13,779 --> 01:31:15,840
AMY: Okay, 11... JERRY: Em-bear-assed about? (laughs)

1668
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,819
(laughter)

1669
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:19,239
JERRY: All right. RYAN: I say that really loud.

1670
01:31:19,239 --> 01:31:24,439
AMY: Seven... Okay, so with an 11...plus I get a plus six?

1671
01:31:24,439 --> 01:31:26,979
JERRY: Mmhmm, yeah. 17. AMY: So, 17.

1672
01:31:26,979 --> 01:31:28,979
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is the bite?

1673
01:31:28,979 --> 01:31:34,299
Yeah, so you just transform and then you just lope...

1674
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:37,019
AMY: Lope! Okay!    JERRY: down, right down the middle,

1675
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:41,640
JERRY: I mean, you guys have to make way. There's not enough room for you guys and the bear.

1676
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,860
RYAN: You don't just make curds... you make whey. JERRY: No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; KATE: I just let her go over me.

1677
01:31:44,859 --> 01:31:46,939
JERRY: Yeah, exactly, you just...

1678
01:31:46,939 --> 01:31:49,019
KRIS: Curd jokes. Love it.

1679
01:31:49,159 --> 01:31:54,979
JERRY: And then you just-- you close your jaws down around the thickest part of this thing.

1680
01:31:54,979 --> 01:31:57,479
AMY: I sure do. We'll see how much it hurts.

1681
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:00,299
JERRY: Jeez! AMY: Yep! Plus four so 11.

1682
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,380
KRIS: Oh! That's tangy! JERRY: (high pitched scream)

1683
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:04,140
AMY: But because I'm a bear-- a special thing about bears...

1684
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:05,700
JERRY: You know there's something  special about bears y'all.

1685
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:06,979
RYAN: Hold up everyone, bear facts.

1686
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:13,519
AMY: Nature facts time. Bears have multiattack so I also get to get him with my claws.

1687
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,420
KRIS: I get to roll for each tooth!

1688
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:18,500
KRIS: Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! AMY: It's going to be a long night, folks.

1689
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,699
AMY: Okay, so I get to do the claws now.

1690
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:24,500
AMY: Ah! Oh! 19! JERRY: Whoa! &gt;&gt; KATE: Dang...

1691
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,380
AMY: Which actually would be a 25 but... KRIS: Who cares?

1692
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,380
AMY: It's fine, I don't want to show off.

1693
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:31,079
JERRY: Yeah, we're not comparing numbers, obviously. RYAN: It's got keen smell.

1694
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:34,619
KRIS: Bears can't count! AMY: Keen smell? That's not going to help me here.

1695
01:32:34,619 --> 01:32:40,659
AMY: Okay so I get to do 2d6 plus four of slashing... So that's a three... plus four. Seven.

1696
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,800
JERRY: So it's 18 total? KATE: Rosie's impressed.

1697
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,560
RYAN: That bear's got some crazy stats. JERRY: Jeez.

1698
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:52,300
JERRY: Right, so you have grabbed it and then as those jaws clamp down, it's trying to do its shit.

1699
01:32:52,300 --> 01:33:02,520
It has a canned response when it has been seized. You know what I mean? It's trying to flow out and the jaw is

1700
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:09,980
just right down on it. And then you take that opportunity while it's there, pinned down, just to shred whatever its

1701
01:33:09,979 --> 01:33:17,719
midsection equivalent would be. Yeah, it has begun to weep a black fluid.

1702
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:21,239
AMY: My favorite.  JERRY: Yeah, so flavorful.

1703
01:33:22,659 --> 01:33:23,619
JERRY: Donaar.

1704
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,679
RYAN: This thing's not dead yet? So is it in her mouth?

1705
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:31,159
JERRY: Right now it is, but it's slowly flowing out.

1706
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:34,699
RYAN: Yeah, I don't know. If I go at it am I going to hit it?

1707
01:33:34,699 --> 01:33:37,659
AMY: Who cares? Right? I made you ugly. JERRY: No, no, this is not that type of situation.

1708
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:40,119
RYAN: Okay, all right. Then I'll go at it with my greatsword.

1709
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,675
JERRY: Let's see it.  RYAN: All right, so...

1710
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,800
JERRY: That's going to be d20 for you.  RYAN: Yeah, plus five on it. Right?

1711
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:47,960
AMY &amp; JERRY: Mmhmm.

1712
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:50,760
RYAN: 15.

1713
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,655
JERRY: 15, yeah. That connects.

1714
01:33:52,654 --> 01:33:54,899
JERRY: Let's see some damage. RYAN: 2d6 plus three.

1715
01:33:54,899 --> 01:33:56,014
JERRY: Ho ho...

1716
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,760
RYAN: 2d6 plus three slashing.

1717
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:00,979
KRIS: Oh yeah, this thing is so slashable.

1718
01:34:00,979 --> 01:34:02,119
AMY: Ooh... RYAN: 13!

1719
01:34:02,119 --> 01:34:05,119
JERRY: Jeez! &gt;&gt; KATE: Ooh! That's a big hit. KRIS: That's some sword.

1720
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:06,779
JERRY: Wow that is... KRIS: That's a great sword!

1721
01:34:06,779 --> 01:34:07,859
RYAN: Thanks.

1722
01:34:07,859 --> 01:34:12,099
JERRY: That is exactly its level of hit points.

1723
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,500
RYAN: Hey! I killed it. AMY: What line do you say when you kill it?

1724
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,180
AMY: You've got to say something cool! JERRY: Do you have a greatsword line that's...?

1725
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:19,320
RYAN: A greatsword line? I thought I needed a door line.

1726
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:20,579
AMY: Whatever. RYAN: Oh.

1727
01:34:20,579 --> 01:34:25,300
RYAN: I don't know, I got nothing. I start-- I panic. And I start weeping.

1728
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,300
(laughing) RYAN: (whiny crying sounds)

1729
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,980
RYAN: "Is it dead? Oh no!"

1730
01:34:28,979 --> 01:34:32,139
And then I feel real guilty because we had something for a minute.

1731
01:34:32,145 --> 01:34:35,160
RYAN: I was halfway to marrying the thing a minute ago. KRIS: Not my door wife!

1732
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:37,399
RYAN: "Oh! I a-door you!" (fake crying)

1733
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:42,720
(all fake crying)

1734
01:34:43,699 --> 01:34:44,340
JERRY: Tears.

1735
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:52,891
So basically, as soon as it's trying to get away from this grip and these claws, as soon as it tries to slide away

1736
01:34:52,899 --> 01:35:02,659
you slice it like a cake. The two halves try to go their disparate ways. They are not able to. A foot or so away,

1737
01:35:02,659 --> 01:35:07,699
in each case, they just stop and then reduce into puddles.

1738
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:18,820
It is at this time that two of the cauldron chairs begin to begin to lope their way up the stairs.

1739
01:35:18,819 --> 01:35:21,059
AMY: Is it Beauty and the Beast in here? God!

1740
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,060
JERRY: Beauty and the motherfucking Beast, you all.

1741
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:30,579
So they are on their way up right now. And if I understand this situation correctly...

1742
01:35:30,579 --> 01:35:33,180
AMY: This Fantasia... JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

1743
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,340
KATE: Are they coming to help?

1744
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:37,039
JERRY: No! You're not their guest.

1745
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:44,720
We have Donaar, Walnut, Rosie, and then K'thriss.

1746
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,240
KRIS: I'm in the back. JERRY: You are in the back.

1747
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:49,719
JERRY: And that's great. KRIS: And I'm presenting....

1748
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,400
JERRY: Yeah exactly (laughing) KRIS: for these cauldrons.

1749
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:55,699
KRIS: Here they come. JERRY: No, no, so you just hear the ringing of the...

1750
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,460
JERRY: of the heavy metal-- KRIS: Of the shell? &gt;&gt; JERRY: of the shell.

1751
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:07,960
JERRY: And you see the legs of the stools just running up. You see two of them skittering up the up the stairs

1752
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:10,600
behind you and they are coming to get you.

1753
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,400
KRIS: (grunts)

1754
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:16,460
JERRY: Let's see what we're talking about in terms of your armor.

1755
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,180
KRIS: You're going to love it. JERRY: 13?

1756
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:22,340
KRIS: Oh it's a push. So it, yeah, it hits me. JERRY: Oh I love it. This is great news.

1757
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:25,500
KRIS: Bites me right on the tail. Ah! Do drow have tails?

1758
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,800
JERRY: Exactly, no no. So... AMY: I don't think so. Maybe.

1759
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:34,779
JERRY: before pseudopods were whipping out, this you see it come up and then you see around the base and

1760
01:36:34,779 --> 01:36:38,519
bowl of the cauldron you see the teeth emerge.

1761
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:41,000
KRIS: Oh the whole seat becomes the mouth?

1762
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,939
JERRY: And then it sort of jumps and tries to catch you in midair.

1763
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:47,399
KRIS: (groans in pain) JERRY: They are starving.

1764
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:50,060
JERRY: They think that-- AMY: They want some of that sweet, sweet drow!

1765
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:56,360
JERRY: Oh yeah, they have heard about it, and this is a bucket list item for them. You know what I mean?

1766
01:36:56,359 --> 01:36:57,779
KATE: It's a delicacy. AMY: Get it because they're bucket seats? I don't...

1767
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:00,759
JERRY: Oh it's so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a choice meat. KATE: I liked it. I liked it.

1768
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:03,119
JERRY: It's so good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: High grade. RYAN: Maybe I shouldn't have yelled at the bartender.

1769
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:06,220
JERRY: That's nine points. KRIS: Rancher's Reserve... All right.

1770
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,380
KATE: Ooh nine points. KRIS: Yeah

1771
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:10,380
RYAN: I yell out an apology for yelling at the bartender earlier.

1772
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,699
JERRY: "It was wrong!" RYAN: I say, "Was it...? I'm sorry!"

1773
01:37:12,699 --> 01:37:15,300
JERRY: "It was wrong, the whole thing was wrong!" AMY: That's not how we talk about our feelings.

1774
01:37:15,619 --> 01:37:17,099
RYAN: Does anything happen?

1775
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:19,579
JERRY: Oh yeah, he gets-- KATE: He gets a big old bite. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It hurts me a lot.

1776
01:37:19,579 --> 01:37:22,059
RYAN: It bites you hard (laughs) JERRY: He gets his ass bit... what kinda hit points

1777
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:24,700
JERRY: do you have left over there? RYAN: It detects the weakness of the apology.

1778
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:26,779
KRIS: It takes me to 12. JERRY: Yeah, okay...

1779
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:28,460
KATE: Rosie says, "That's a big mouth."

1780
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:31,520
JERRY: Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot of mouth. But there's another one coming.

1781
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,579
KRIS: (munching sounds) JERRY: Ugh! That's even higher.

1782
01:37:34,579 --> 01:37:36,965
KRIS: Oh no. Oh but it doesn't beat my armor class, though.

1783
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:39,579
JERRY: No, it does. It really, really does.

1784
01:37:39,579 --> 01:37:42,760
KRIS: I have armor class 13 and then 15 and up.

1785
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,560
KRIS: You've got to roll a 14. JERRY: Oh it's a range. Nice.

1786
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,660
JERRY: No it doesn't work that way, warlock.

1787
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:50,579
KATE: That'd be great. JERRY: That is another seven points.

1788
01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:52,494
KRIS: Oh mamma mia. It's not looking good.

1789
01:37:52,494 --> 01:37:55,574
JERRY: Nope. And then we move right back up to the top for Rosie.

1790
01:37:56,414 --> 01:37:57,414
KATE: Okay.

1791
01:37:57,734 --> 01:38:04,759
JERRY: So the situation has been altered substantially. The one that you were striking cleverly was a large

1792
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:10,340
floppy thing, and these are smaller, more agile cauldron beasts.

1793
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,199
KATE: Okay.

1794
01:38:11,659 --> 01:38:16,119
KRIS: And right now I'm like pressed up against a wall bleeding my own blood...

1795
01:38:16,119 --> 01:38:16,939
(laughter)

1796
01:38:16,939 --> 01:38:19,719
KRIS: that's now painting... JERRY: This is new.

1797
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,980
KRIS: Yeah. A new sensation for me... Yeah. JERRY: This is a new sensation... Yeah.

1798
01:38:22,979 --> 01:38:26,859
KATE: Umm so... I... I can't help you.

1799
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:27,960
JERRY: Fuck you.

1800
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:30,340
KATE: Yep. "Fuck you," says grand... KRIS: I turn my...

1801
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:32,980
KRIS: I get a drink. (laughter)

1802
01:38:32,984 --> 01:38:35,659
JERRY: It would just come straight out... like... KRIS: Yeah. (laughs)

1803
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:39,420
JERRY: You would not even be able to absorb it. So what do you got there, Rosie?

1804
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:46,480
KATE: Rosie is just going to go at-- take a-- sigh heavily because she was not expecting this day to go like this.

1805
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:49,879
KATE: And take it out on the-- JERRY: It was supposed to be a day of filling out forms.

1806
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:55,739
KATE: It was, it was purely-- Like first day on the job they don't put you to work. You fill out all the HR shit. But she

1807
01:38:55,739 --> 01:39:01,159
is actually getting stuff done. So she's like, "All right,  well I guess I'm just going to continue on my merry

1808
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:05,539
quarterstaff way." Try to attack whatever is attacking him, because he seems cool and he had a nut.

1809
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:08,000
KRIS: There's, there's two of them so you've just got to pick one, I guess.

1810
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,979
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, take your pick. KATE: Yeah, I'll pick the one that's most--

1811
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:13,579
KATE: Oh I see. They're both aggro on you. KRIS: Yeah.

1812
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,180
KATE: I'll take the one on the left. JERRY: I can track that.

1813
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:19,979
KRIS: Ooh... KATE: That's a 24.

1814
01:39:19,979 --> 01:39:22,039
KRIS: You're a performer. JERRY: Damn!

1815
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:24,180
KATE: Thanks, gentlemen. JERRY: That's all right.

1816
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:26,520
AMY: I guess we can just go home. You got this right? RYAN: Goo goo gooo!

1817
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,740
RYAN: Hey I killed the door! JERRY: So let's see it.

1818
01:39:28,739 --> 01:39:29,779
KATE: All right.

1819
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:30,979
RYAN: (softly) I did a thing...

1820
01:39:30,979 --> 01:39:37,500
KATE: So that's going to be five bludgeoning, and then my bonus action will be my martial arts.

1821
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:43,199
And I will.... do another hit on that...

1822
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:45,400
KATE: Which is going to be... oh!  KRIS: Aww...

1823
01:39:45,399 --> 01:39:49,239
KATE: Oh no! But it's okay because I have this lucky ability. I can reroll a natural one.

1824
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:52,500
JERRY: WOW! Let's see it &gt;&gt; KRIS: What? RYAN: Nice! &gt;&gt; KATE: I'm a lucky little halfling.

1825
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:55,860
KATE: Okay. That's not much better... That's a ten.

1826
01:39:55,859 --> 01:39:58,119
JERRY: No. That does not do it. &gt;&gt; KATE: Okay... KRIS: Shoot &gt;&gt; AMY: Oh no...

1827
01:39:58,119 --> 01:40:01,300
KATE: But I did the five points of damage anyway. JERRY: So you whack...

1828
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:06,479
JERRY: straight over the top, I mean everything that would lead you to believe that you're going to hear a

1829
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:13,619
ring of metal, and it's just-- it's like training against a dummy full of straw. Like it's just this sort of hollow

1830
01:40:13,619 --> 01:40:21,439
thick sound. And then you kick straight in and it just opens its mouth and your foot goes into that void

1831
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:25,579
expanse. You withdraw. You're not able to deliver any damage on that one.

1832
01:40:25,579 --> 01:40:27,319
Walnut Dankgrass!

1833
01:40:27,744 --> 01:40:29,720
AMY: Umm... RYAN: Still a bear.

1834
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:30,994
AMY: Still a bear.

1835
01:40:30,994 --> 01:40:32,824
JERRY: Still pro-bear. AMY: Uhh... (laugh)

1836
01:40:33,305 --> 01:40:35,275
AMY: Very pro-bear platform here.

1837
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,460
So seeing this, I would like to...

1838
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:41,000
and I don't want to use this word...

1839
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,279
but I can't think of any other word for it, but just like barrel through the hallway...

1840
01:40:44,284 --> 01:40:46,979
KRIS: (fake laugh) AMY: Nope. It was not appropriate. &gt;&gt; RYAN: (snorts)

1841
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:50,720
KRIS: Because bears always hide in barrels. I get it. RYAN: Yep! Yeah.

1842
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:52,659
AMY: Yeah! Exactly.

1843
01:40:52,659 --> 01:40:54,359
KRIS: Because that's what they balance on top of at the circus!

1844
01:40:54,359 --> 01:40:56,859
JERRY: I will, I will turn this game around! (laughter)

1845
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,940
(laughter)

1846
01:40:59,039 --> 01:41:01,100
JERRY: Let's see what you've got-- AMY: I don't have all these two dollar words Jerry!

1847
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,340
JERRY: Let's see what you've got, Walnut.

1848
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:06,819
AMY: Okay. So I would like to go for the one that's not getting quarterstaffed.

1849
01:41:06,819 --> 01:41:11,559
JERRY: Exactly. So you're going to go for the fresh one? So this is the situation, obviously your parents went

1850
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:17,400
away for a week's vacation. They left the keys to-- No. That's not what happened. So she has connected

1851
01:41:17,399 --> 01:41:20,920
with one on one side. You're basically just very surprised.

1852
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:21,875
KRIS: Yeah.

1853
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:27,539
JERRY: You're trying to make yourself as thin as possible. To your right, is a halfling ninja monk.

1854
01:41:27,539 --> 01:41:32,519
To your left, squeezing you against the right side of the railing...

1855
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:35,180
AMY: Oh, yeah.  KRIS: Then that hot musk rising.

1856
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:37,560
JERRY: is a gigantic, angry bear.

1857
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:40,260
AMY: Yeah it's like when they're trying to get in the tree.

1858
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,440
KRIS: With the like prehensile like... the mouth. JERRY: Yeah, yeah (growling)

1859
01:41:42,439 --> 01:41:44,799
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. AMY: So yeah, I want to go for a bite if I can...

1860
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,039
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, do it, absolutely. RYAN &amp; KATE: (in unison) Do a bite!

1861
01:41:47,635 --> 01:41:51,739
KRIS: Do a bite! JERRY: Do a bite but remember you got juice.

1862
01:41:51,739 --> 01:41:54,119
JERRY: You have juice from the channel too. AMY: That's right I do have juice!

1863
01:41:54,119 --> 01:41:56,079
AMY: Mmm... I would like to juice. JERRY: Up to you.

1864
01:41:56,079 --> 01:41:58,800
JERRY: Yeah yeah. So this is for your bite attack? RYAN: We have to save Kris, he's pretty much dead.

1865
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,400
AMY: For my bite attack, yes. &gt;&gt; JERRY: He's fucked. KRIS: I'm a dead body, it's what I've always wanted.

1866
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:04,300
RYAN: It's what he always wanted. K'thriss actually jumped into the cauldron. AMY: Thank you, friends of Walnut.

1867
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:05,539
JERRY: Hit it! AMY: I'm doing an attack here!

1868
01:42:05,539 --> 01:42:07,659
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: Have some reverence.

1869
01:42:07,659 --> 01:42:09,579
JERRY: I-- I'm in command AMY: Silence, please.

1870
01:42:09,579 --> 01:42:11,340
AMY: It is my turn! No, I'm joking.

1871
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,000
RYAN: Here comes the one.

1872
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:15,239
AMY: I get to do it twice though!

1873
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:16,139
RYAN: 19! AMY: Oh nice!

1874
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:18,180
AMY: I mean, it's not going to get better than that but is it?

1875
01:42:18,739 --> 01:42:20,939
AMY: It didn't. JERRY: It could... it could!

1876
01:42:20,939 --> 01:42:22,219
AMY: So 25?

1877
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:25,759
JERRY: Oh yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; AMY: Okay so lets get...  KRIS: You hit all cauldrons ever made.

1878
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,100
AMY: I hit him and its parents. I... (laughs)

1879
01:42:29,239 --> 01:42:30,739
KRIS: You hit a cauldron factory!

1880
01:42:30,739 --> 01:42:33,639
JERRY: Somewhere a cauldron factory catches flame!

1881
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,000
(laughter)

1882
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,420
AM: Okay, so that is... 13 piercing. JERRY: Jeez!

1883
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:42,140
JERRY: Gosh... &gt;&gt; RYAN: You going to multi? AMY: And then, if I can, get a little claw in there.

1884
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:50,100
JERRY: Yeah, absolutely. So, this is a thing where it's exposed its fangs through the false kettle. And you just

1885
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:56,260
connect it with the top. You have bitten the top of it. Shaken it a couple times. And now you're ready, now

1886
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:58,380
that you have it you're going to go to work with the claw.

1887
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:00,559
AMY: Well we'll see. RYAN: They wanted us to sit in these things...

1888
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,520
KRIS:  I know... &gt;&gt; RYAN: Can you believe that? JERRY: Think about that!

1889
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:05,059
JERRY: Get OSHA in here. AMY: 17? 17?

1890
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:06,820
JERRY: 17 to hit? Yes absolutely. AMY: Yeah, is that going to do it?

1891
01:43:06,819 --> 01:43:08,399
AMY: Great. KRIS: Sure.

1892
01:43:08,659 --> 01:43:12,500
AMY: (laughs) Thanks, Kris. KRIS: Oh, no it hits. Yes please. More hits!

1893
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:16,020
AMY: Ummm... (mumbling) 11?

1894
01:43:16,055 --> 01:43:19,115
JERRY: I love it. I love that set. God I love that set. AMY: Good, it's very nice.

1895
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:24,239
JERRY: So good. I feel like it's making me a better dungeon master to have these rad dice on the table.

1896
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:26,239
AMY: It feels good. JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen!

1897
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:29,074
JERRY: So you're fresh off your greatsword... RYAN: Yeah.

1898
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:31,079
JERRY: Has been hefted back up onto the shoulder.

1899
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:33,220
RYAN: I guess I should go after the weak one, right?

1900
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,920
JERRY: Cull the weak! RYAN: Yeah. I mean, we've got to take...

1901
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:36,699
AMY: Dealer's choice.

1902
01:43:36,699 --> 01:43:39,494
RYAN: Yeah, let's go to the one that was just weakened. JERRY: Savaged?

1903
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:42,439
RYAN: Yeah, so I'll go at him with the greatsword again. AMY: Finish him off.

1904
01:43:42,439 --> 01:43:45,539
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. The premium sword experience. RYAN: Yeah.

1905
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:47,699
KATE: Hey could you just do a little roleplay?

1906
01:43:47,699 --> 01:43:48,460
RYAN: Huh?

1907
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,060
KRIS: Yeah, give us something. AMY: Give us some flavor!

1908
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,020
KATE: Give us some spice. JERRY: Yeah. Give us some flavor!

1909
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:53,200
RYAN: I uh... KRIS: You loose it off your shoulder--

1910
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:56,480
RYAN: I pull my sword over, and then I walk over to the cauldron, and then I go...

1911
01:43:56,479 --> 01:43:59,000
KRIS: You do the sword move that you see in games. RYAN: I do the... yeah. &gt;&gt; JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

1912
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,159
KRIS: I want to send dark souls when you have the... RYAN: I don't know... uhhh. All right.

1913
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,900
JERRY: And I... and I confer... KATE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1914
01:44:02,899 --> 01:44:04,579
JERRY: I confer disadvantage on this roll.

1915
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:07,239
RYAN: I drag... I use mine to counter-- KRIS: No, you can't. &gt;&gt; AMY: You can't.

1916
01:44:07,239 --> 01:44:09,119
JERRY: It's too late. RYAN: I thought I could counter yours!

1917
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:11,059
KRIS: No... KATE: He won't let us. I tried.

1918
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:13,700
RYAN: Oh... All right. JERRY: Next time. Next time, we'll try it.

1919
01:44:13,699 --> 01:44:15,679
JERRY: This time we're learning. RYAN: So conferring disadvantage means?

1920
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,420
JERRY: You roll two dice and you take the shitty one.

1921
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,760
RYAN: Ah, shit, all right. AMY: You got it! &gt;&gt; KATE: It's okay, you got this!

1922
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,140
KRIS: Roll the same number twice-- KATE: We believe in you.

1923
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:23,240
KRIS: that's all you got to do. Defeat him! RYAN: Okay.

1924
01:44:23,715 --> 01:44:25,000
RYAN: 12... JERRY: 12.

1925
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,414
KRIS: Okay... KATE: Not bad, not bad.

1926
01:44:26,414 --> 01:44:28,574
KRIS: Not showing off, but... AMY: But it would be... you still get the plus.

1927
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:31,760
RYAN: Five. &gt;&gt; AMY: Oh, all right. (disappointed noises from all)

1928
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,159
RYAN: So I've got to take the five...  KRIS: So I put my sword back on my shoulder.

1929
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:37,300
RYAN: So that's ten. JERRY: All right, so....

1930
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:44,539
JERRY: That's not able to do it. So Walnut has it in the fangs. Shakes it, claws it, and then flings it in the

1931
01:44:44,539 --> 01:44:50,859
manner of a wild beast, up in the air for that second snatch. You try to come down with the greatswordâ¦

1932
01:44:50,859 --> 01:44:52,000
it just misses.

1933
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,640
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b! AMY: Okay good.

1934
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:57,220
AMY: I was waiting for the, "And then it hits Walnut." RYAN: Yeah.

1935
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:59,640
JERRY: Yeah yeah. And then you die! RYAN: And then you lop off her paw...

1936
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:02,579
JERRY: Exactly. So K'thriss Drow'b, what do you got? KRIS: I can only...

1937
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:07,039
RYAN: Oh I was going to do a smite and shit... KRIS: I'm just torn up... near death.

1938
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:13,680
JERRY: No you're savaged. But the dark robe is doing you a lot of favors here.

1939
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:17,220
KRIS: Oh yeah. JERRY: I mean you still look great.

1940
01:45:17,539 --> 01:45:19,479
KATE: Slimming. RYAN: The mud hides a lot.

1941
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:22,359
RYAN: Still got the mud on you. JERRY: Obviously the abdomen-- KRIS: Wrinklefree.

1942
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:24,859
JERRY: Larvae. You know what I mean? KRIS: Yeah. Exactly.

1943
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:32,399
KRIS: I can only wonder at how much I've disappointed this god by going from level nine to three.

1944
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:38,960
But I know that that might be responsible that-- that even at his most eldritch-- it was just a measly--

1945
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,880
couldn't even take a door out.

1946
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:48,160
So I'm going to look at the more damaged of the cauldrons

1947
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:53,800
and I'm going to cast Dissonant Whispers upon it.

1948
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,900
KATE: What does Dissonant Whispers do? JERRY: Yeah!

1949
01:45:54,899 --> 01:45:56,039
KRIS: I'mma tell you 'bout it.

1950
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:59,019
JERRY: Dude you got to dish up this RP for me, man. KRIS: Yeah, exactly.

1951
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:01,260
RYAN: He pulls out a book? JERRY: (shouts) What the fuck?

1952
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:03,380
JERRY: Oh that's a premium experience!

1953
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,920
JERRY: It'd be like you brought out like a veggie tray.

1954
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,940
KRIS: Yeah. For all!

1955
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,699
JERRY: Hungry? KRIS: What a party!

1956
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:15,359
KRIS: I don't need the book description. You can get that for the damage.

1957
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:25,299
It's not so much a dissonant whisper at the cauldron, but more of a prayer to the sigil which I'm still clutching.

1958
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:30,260
And hopefully this cauldron will overhear it.

1959
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,975
JERRY: Now, hold on a second, there's an attack roll? KRIS: I don't care if there's damage.

1960
01:46:33,979 --> 01:46:38,739
KRIS: I'm sorry. That's incredibly important. This is a wisdom saving throw.

1961
01:46:38,739 --> 01:46:40,399
JERRY: Perfect, yeah that's vital. So you don't need to throw.

1962
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:41,920
KRIS: For this creature.

1963
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:44,120
KRIS: You're right. JERRY: Yeah. You ready?

1964
01:46:44,119 --> 01:46:45,319
KRIS: That's critical. JERRY: K.

1965
01:46:46,359 --> 01:46:47,479
RYAN: How smart is this cauldron?

1966
01:46:47,479 --> 01:46:50,639
JERRY: I was just going to say, it's not-- There are... KRIS: It's a wise cauldron...

1967
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:53,260
KRIS: It's not the most smart. RYAN: Yeah, beyond it's years. It's seen a lot of butts.

1968
01:46:53,619 --> 01:46:56,180
JERRY: There are smarter cauldrons. 13?

1969
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,600
KRIS: Uh, let's see against mine? JERRY: Yeah.

1970
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,100
KRIS: Oh, no you don't get it.

1971
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,960
JERRY: Okay, no I'm... Listen-- RYAN: Mine's a million.

1972
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,659
RYAN: I'm super smart. JERRY: I'm eldritch as shit so...

1973
01:47:04,659 --> 01:47:05,899
KRIS: Me real smart.

1974
01:47:05,899 --> 01:47:07,179
JERRY: Yeah yeah, so dish it up.

1975
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:12,740
KRIS: All right, so then it becomes a 3d6 psychic damage.

1976
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:14,720
KRIS: And what a mind he's got on him. KATE: (gasps) Oh my god.

1977
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:21,520
KRIS: That's eight and it must immediately use its reaction to escape my presence.

1978
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:22,960
The presence of these whispers.

1979
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:28,699
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. So this evil prayer, maybe the first prayer you learned,

1980
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:34,279
the first revelation of this chunk that you carved out.

1981
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:46,500
As soon as the whispers hit it like a physical wave. And you see it tip back over the edge of the top stair.

1982
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:54,640
And then halfway through that process it just bursts into like a pustulant liquid and runs down the stairs.

1983
01:47:54,899 --> 01:47:57,819
KRIS: As a bonus action I go, "Yah yay. That's what you get."

1984
01:47:57,819 --> 01:47:59,619
(laughing)

1985
01:47:59,619 --> 01:48:01,460
RYAN: All bleeding like, "Aagh."

1986
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,340
KRIS: The other one is still very much in my way. RYAN: It's like right in your face.

1987
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,079
RYAN: "I'm the best. Ow..."

1988
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:12,899
JERRY: The other one is going to chomp chomp chomp at Rosie Beestinger.

1989
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:14,539
KATE: Come at me.

1990
01:48:15,779 --> 01:48:18,399
RYAN: What are we going to fight next a fireplace? JERRY: Ooh 18?

1991
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:20,200
KATE: Yes. KRIS: That was a hot hit.

1992
01:48:20,199 --> 01:48:21,539
JERRY: 18.  KATE: Yes. &gt;&gt; AMY: Oh no...

1993
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:27,859
JERRY: Now, it delivers unto you six points of damage...

1994
01:48:28,475 --> 01:48:30,745
JERRY: and uh... AMY: This level it's a lot.

1995
01:48:31,399 --> 01:48:41,119
JERRY: an additional six. So as it bites, it slavers into the wound an acidic spittle...

1996
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:42,559
AMY: (gags) Disgusting.

1997
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,539
KATE: No. Okay, so... JERRY: It's true, I'm sorry.

1998
01:48:44,539 --> 01:48:45,600
KRIS: Right in that hole. JERRY: It's not my fault.

1999
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,579
KATE: That's another six points of damage? JERRY: Yeah, it's 12 total.

2000
01:48:47,579 --> 01:48:48,619
KATE: Okay.

2001
01:48:48,619 --> 01:48:55,659
JERRY: So that's down, and we are back to Rosie. So you have an opportunity to respond with immediacy.

2002
01:48:55,659 --> 01:48:56,574
AMY: Yeah. KATE: Okay.

2003
01:48:57,239 --> 01:49:00,079
AMY: Get them, granny! KRIS: We're both, like not hot over here.

2004
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:03,420
KATE: Yeah if you guys got some of those good heals...

2005
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:05,399
KATE: we could probably use some of that. AMY: Not as a bear.

2006
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,480
KATE: Not as a bear, great. Good, good, good. JERRY: (bear noises)

2007
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,275
JERRY: Just a big shrug. Like the biggest shrug! KRIS: Yeah.

2008
01:49:13,274 --> 01:49:15,045
AMY: Though truly. KATE: Okay.

2009
01:49:15,399 --> 01:49:17,059
KATE: I'm going to use one of my juicy die.

2010
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:18,720
JERRY: I was going to say, you have a heap of dice.

2011
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,159
KATE: Yeah I do. I have a pool. JERRY: So put them to work.

2012
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:21,800
KATE: And I'm just going to... AMY: Oh, Rosie!

2013
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,140
KATE: I'm going to keep attacking. JERRY: Yeah we got the Rosie fans in the channel!

2014
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:27,360
AMY: I guess she's really cool. KATE: She's got...

2015
01:49:27,359 --> 01:49:31,880
KATE: I mean she's not a berserker, she can't enter a berserker rage but if she could she'd be doing it now.

2016
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:34,420
KATE: She's just angry at this point. KRIS: It's so polite.

2017
01:49:34,699 --> 01:49:37,859
JERRY: Bless your heart. KATE: That's a bless your heart kind of anger.

2018
01:49:38,135 --> 01:49:41,225
KATE: Okay so the then plus five is 15 to attack. Okay. JERRY: Yep.

2019
01:49:41,225 --> 01:49:42,375
JERRY: That connects. KATE: Great.

2020
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:45,625
KATE: So then I'm going to do... AMY: Do work.

2021
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:52,800
KATE: Oh yeah, ten plus... I'm going to use my bonus and a ki point for flurry of blows.

2022
01:49:53,899 --> 01:49:55,899
KATE: So... JERRY: So you're going to come at him twice?

2023
01:49:55,899 --> 01:50:00,559
KATE: Mmhmm. Two kicks. My signature move...

2024
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,760
JERRY: (snorts) RYAN: Chop chop.

2025
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,640
KRIS: Mmhmm! KATE: So that's a 17...

2026
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,700
JERRY &amp; KRIS: Mmhmm!

2027
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:07,420
KRIS: Mmhmm! KATE: Which gives me another six...

2028
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:10,920
KATE: And... a 13. AMY: Oof, you almost had it.

2029
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,220
KRIS: Yeah, almost had it. KATE: 13? AC? &gt;&gt; JERRY: Yeah!

2030
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:15,740
KATE: That's a hit? Okay, good. JERRY: Yeah. Jeez, Rosie.

2031
01:50:15,739 --> 01:50:17,300
KATE: And that's a 4.

2032
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:20,039
RYAN: Wow. JERRY: All right. So this is what it looks like.

2033
01:50:20,039 --> 01:50:21,399
AMY: Granny came to play! RYAN: Yeah, seriously.

2034
01:50:21,399 --> 01:50:25,420
JERRY: This is what it looks like. The first strike just goes into its gullet.

2035
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:36,039
And she uses that to lever it and flip it up behind and then there are two kicks behind her in midair.

2036
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:40,880
It crashes through the railing and hits the ground and becomes a pool.

2037
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:44,260
RYAN: Okay, and the other one's running away from you.

2038
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,400
JERRY: No. They are they are dead! KRIS: No, they're obliterated.

2039
01:50:45,399 --> 01:50:48,099
RYAN: Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS:  it also did the same thing. KATE: Yeah, no they're dead. They're out.

2040
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,660
JERRY: No! There is a there is a slippery... RYAN: Oh. Thought they ran away.

2041
01:50:50,659 --> 01:50:52,439
JERRY: non-OSHA-approved stairway...

2042
01:50:52,439 --> 01:50:54,399
RYAN: Nice.

2043
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:56,039
JERRY: on the way down.

2044
01:50:56,039 --> 01:50:57,539
RYAN: All right KATE: We're bleeding out. So...

2045
01:50:57,539 --> 01:50:59,100
RYAN: Uh... I say...

2046
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:05,159
RYAN: "Nobody touch anything," I say, "I don't know if you guys noticed, but everything's alive."

2047
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:06,359
JERRY: Yeah!

2048
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:09,099
RYAN: All right... In the moment to breathe... KATE: As we're all covered in goo.

2049
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:14,760
RYAN: I will-- since you're still a bear... I guess I'm the only one who has healing stuff.

2050
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:17,640
So I'll have to lay on hands individually on you guys. What are you at?

2051
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,980
KRIS: I'm at five. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Out of? KATE: Six.

2052
01:51:19,979 --> 01:51:21,454
KRIS: 21. KATE: Same.

2053
01:51:21,454 --> 01:51:23,140
KRIS: And she's at six out of 21, so... KATE: Yeah.

2054
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:24,185
RYAN: All right.

2055
01:51:24,185 --> 01:51:26,440
KRIS: We're both not... super hot. &gt;&gt; RYAN: All right so... AMY: Who do you like better?

2056
01:51:26,439 --> 01:51:28,739
RYAN: I don't have enough.  KRIS: I was going to say, who's an asset to the team?

2057
01:51:28,739 --> 01:51:33,119
RYAN: Well I have 15 I can divvy amongst the both of you.

2058
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:36,060
KATE: "Well I'm I'm quite old. It's my time."

2059
01:51:36,699 --> 01:51:38,880
AMY: Oh my god! KRIS: "But I want to die!"

2060
01:51:38,939 --> 01:51:41,179
AMY: That's true!  KATE: We can fight over who gets to die!

2061
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:42,619
KRIS: "Don't take this from me, old woman!"

2062
01:51:42,619 --> 01:51:46,079
RYAN: I can give you eight and you seven. And then you both...

2063
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:48,100
KATE: Oh yeah, that'd be great. KRIS: (sighs) Fine.

2064
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:51,860
RYAN: I'd have to do them individually, but we're not in combat so it doesn't matter.

2065
01:51:51,979 --> 01:51:53,719
RYAN: So I'll do that. KRIS: Back from that sweet brink.

2066
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:56,740
RYAN: And I'm out of healing points now. KATE: Okay great. &gt;&gt; JERRY: For now.

2067
01:51:56,739 --> 01:52:01,579
JERRY: So this is how it works. As you are healing them...

2068
01:52:01,579 --> 01:52:03,039
RYAN: Mhmm. Backrub.

2069
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:05,159
JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah, it's the full... RYAN: Yeah.

2070
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:08,380
JERRY: This is... It's incredible.

2071
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:14,659
KRIS: Yeah, not just laying on hands, but technique! JERRY: No, no, no. Like, this is Palms Plus.

2072
01:52:14,659 --> 01:52:15,420
EVERYONE: Mmm.

2073
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:17,194
JERRY: This is a real-- it's *deep*.

2074
01:52:17,194 --> 01:52:18,114
AMY: Deep tissue.

2075
01:52:18,114 --> 01:52:19,039
JERRY: Deep tissue.

2076
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:22,699
RYAN: And I say, "Remember when I bought you that drink, and remember when I gave you that money?"

2077
01:52:22,699 --> 01:52:25,880
KRIS: I'm weeping! &gt;&gt; AMY: All he does is give! RYAN: And I just, "All I do is give."

2078
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:29,579
RYAN: (whispers) "All I do is give, guys." KATE: "Yeah." &gt;&gt; KRIS: "This feels so right! So right."

2079
01:52:29,579 --> 01:52:38,439
JERRY: As you're as you're doing this, the wall in front of the house... you can see the boards-- the slats of the

2080
01:52:38,439 --> 01:52:44,299
boards, "flip, flip, flip," and the door that you recognize from before is there.

2081
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,380
RYAN: Hmm. KRIS: (sighs)

2082
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:48,380
KATE: Your wife? Different door? JERRY: Ha! It could be!

2083
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:50,500
KRIS: But the sweet memory! RYAN: I saunter over and I say, "Hey."

2084
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,039
(laughing)

2085
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:54,819
AMY: What's a good looking door like you-- RYAN: "What's a pretty door like you doing in a place like this?"

2086
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,460
KRIS: "I'm newly widowed... Just wondering if you, uh..."

2087
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,760
RYAN: Are we going to have to fight the room now, what's happening?

2088
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:03,239
JERRY: You have-- but now you have PTSD.

2089
01:53:03,239 --> 01:53:06,500
RYAN: I know, and now I don't trust anything! JERRY: The D is for Door. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah!

2090
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:10,119
JERRY: Right? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: Dis-door-der.

2091
01:53:10,119 --> 01:53:12,359
KATE: Got hurt by one door, you're never going to trust.

2092
01:53:12,359 --> 01:53:13,679
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

2093
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,880
JERRY: But there is a door. RYAN: Oh, someone else go first.

2094
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,260
RYAN: I'll tell you that much! KATE: I'm not it. &gt;&gt; AMY: I-- Okay um...

2095
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:22,199
KRIS: Just throw the bear through! RYAN: Yeah!

2096
01:53:22,199 --> 01:53:23,760
KRIS: Just press on it. KATE: Can you bite the door?

2097
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,820
AMY: I go, (growling grunt) and I lumber towards the door. And I like...

2098
01:53:28,819 --> 01:53:29,699
RYAN: Keen Smell?

2099
01:53:29,699 --> 01:53:33,000
AMY: It's not going to help through a portal! RYAN: Smell it!

2100
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
JERRY: Hey so you're still the bear... RYAN: See what you can smell.

2101
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,939
JERRY: you're like (bear groans) AMY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; KATE: (laughing) Yeah!

2102
01:53:37,939 --> 01:53:39,579
AMY: Well, because I can't-- and for those that don't know,

2103
01:53:39,579 --> 01:53:44,899
I cannot now communicate with any of my party members.

2104
01:53:44,899 --> 01:53:47,279
JERRY: Human mouths. &gt;&gt; AMY: Yeah. KRIS: So, but let me clarify this

2105
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:51,639
KRIS: As a bear, you do not possess even the language you once had?

2106
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:52,240
AMY: Nope.

2107
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,679
KRIS: Because I could telepath to you... AMY: I now have--

2108
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,560
KRIS: but you have nothing.   JERRY: Telepathic is fine.

2109
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,820
AMY: Telepathic is fine. That's to the discretion of the DM, and the DM wants to let me do it?

2110
01:54:00,819 --> 01:54:04,179
JERRY: So she has her mental stats. KRIS: Yes. Okay. &gt;&gt;  KATE: Nice.

2111
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,600
JERRY: But she doesn't have a human mouth. RYAN: Mentats.

2112
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,680
KRIS: "Ah... it hurts so bad, go through the door please."

2113
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:11,699
RYAN: You're fine! KATE: Real useful message.

2114
01:54:11,699 --> 01:54:15,319
RYAN: I just gave you... KRIS: I could send that all day. I can talk to it all day!

2115
01:54:15,319 --> 01:54:18,039
KRIS: I don't get a one time. AMY: Bear. Hey, bear. Bear.

2116
01:54:18,039 --> 01:54:19,720
EVERYONE: Bear. Bear. Bear. Bear. JERRY: "Brbrbrbrbrbr"

2117
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,760
AMY: All right, I want to, uh...

2118
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:24,699
So wait is it like that black void thing again?

2119
01:54:24,699 --> 01:54:27,279
JERRY: It is. AMY: Okay, so I will...

2120
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:30,519
AMY: lumber on through. But like, you know, I'm ready.

2121
01:54:30,524 --> 01:54:33,674
AMY: I'm ready for whatever's on the other side. JERRY: You go through like (growl)

2122
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:34,659
KRIS: I was going to say--

2123
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:36,920
AMY: I'd be like, "I'll mess up all the doors!" But not saying anything.

2124
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,520
KRIS: The mass of a gilded acorn is removed from your body.

2125
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:40,900
JERRY:  Yeah. Exactly.

2126
01:54:40,899 --> 01:54:41,920
AMY: (yelps)

2127
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:43,300
KRIS: And it turns out gold is a dense metal.

2128
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:45,000
JERRY: A delicious part... KRIS: So you lose...

2129
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:49,420
JERRY: A delicious part of you. The most delicious part. KRIS: Just your heart is gone.

2130
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:51,079
RYAN: Sweetbreads.   JERRY: No, just one valve! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah!

2131
01:54:51,079 --> 01:54:53,279
AMY: Gross! &gt;&gt; JERRY: Just one valve.  KRIS: The rest of you is good.

2132
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:54,559
AMY: But what really happens?

2133
01:54:54,560 --> 01:55:01,460
JERRY: No, you're fine. As soon the bear head pokes through, the rest of her disappears.

2134
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:03,539
RYAN: Snaps shut. KATE: Rosie's a little worried.

2135
01:55:03,539 --> 01:55:06,539
JERRY: Yeah, it just closes. She's viciously sectioned.

2136
01:55:06,539 --> 01:55:10,060
RYAN: And then the bear head goes into a new room and it's shown mounted on a wall.

2137
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:13,880
KRIS: Right it's just a portal to a bear capture device. RYAN: Yeah.

2138
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:16,619
JERRY: That is not...! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Auto-mount. Yeah. AMY: That was the puzzle.

2139
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:19,100
AMY: We need to feed it a bear. JERRY: Everybody else won.

2140
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:22,579
KRIS: Now we all get 33%. RYAN: We had to trick her into becoming a bear!

2141
01:55:22,579 --> 01:55:24,140
(laughing) KRIS: (claps)

2142
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:26,280
KRIS: He hates bears. Who knew? RYAN: Yeah.

2143
01:55:26,279 --> 01:55:29,619
KATE: I'm going to go last because I'm worried that we're going to enter the same time loop

2144
01:55:29,619 --> 01:55:32,899
and have to fight that damn door again. So I'm going to keep an eye on things from--

2145
01:55:32,899 --> 01:55:37,079
RYAN: No one's going last other than me, when it comes to doors anymore, all right?

2146
01:55:37,079 --> 01:55:38,880
KATE: All right, we can hold hands and go through together.

2147
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,300
JERRY: There's a goddamn system!

2148
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:41,500
RYAN: Yeah!

2149
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:48,800
JERRY: Absolutely. So you pop through. You don't like it. It's like as you're walking through, you're looking over at

2150
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:51,320
the door on the hinge and you're like, "I'm onto you."

2151
01:55:52,460 --> 01:56:00,980
You see those hinges, even the hinge...even the squeak of the hinge is terror. But you pass through. You enter a

2152
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:09,480
a dark room, but there is an arc of light in front of you.

2153
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:11,859
AMY: Does it say, "Congratulations, you did it!"?

2154
01:56:12,199 --> 01:56:14,899
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a big banner, and there's a--

2155
01:56:14,899 --> 01:56:16,239
RYAN: There's a cake. JERRY: And there's a cake.

2156
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:17,380
AMY: And my family's there. JERRY: No!

2157
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:18,659
AMY: Oh, okay.

2158
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:21,880
RYAN: Dad! KATE: Aww.

2159
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:23,600
RYAN: They're telling me they're proud of me.

2160
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:28,279
RYAN: I'm playing baseball and they're watching.  KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; AMY: Okay.

2161
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:31,399
AMY: So I see an arc of light. JERRY: You do. You see an arc of light.

2162
01:56:31,479 --> 01:56:36,239
JERRY: Sort of-- it looks a rough-hewn around the edge, but from here that's what you can see.

2163
01:56:37,039 --> 01:56:38,680
AMY: Okay. Um.

2164
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:45,819
So, I like scratch at the wall as if like, "Hey, guys. This is the signal, like come through."

2165
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,380
JERRY &amp; KATE: Yeah. KRIS: We're all going to go now...

2166
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:50,000
AMY: Okay we're all over. KRIS: I think we're cool, yeah.

2167
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,619
JERRY: They've committed. &gt;&gt; AMY: Oh! JERRY: They have committed already.

2168
01:56:52,619 --> 01:56:53,899
KATE: We don't have... AMY: They're all here!

2169
01:56:53,899 --> 01:56:58,079
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. AMY: Then I'm just going to be at the ready.

2170
01:56:58,079 --> 01:57:09,519
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. It's a musty scent here in this dark corner that you've emerged into. The arc itself, as I said,

2171
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:19,540
looks sort of like rough-hewn stone? But the closer you get to it, I mean even in your bear guise, you know

2172
01:57:19,539 --> 01:57:25,420
exactly what it is. Two things. One, you smell prey. You *smell* prey.

2173
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:29,539
AMY: Keen Smell. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Nice. JERRY: And it requires your...

2174
01:57:29,539 --> 01:57:34,659
JERRY: It requires your elven intellect to tamp down that desire.

2175
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:38,579
It smells like a nest of some kind.

2176
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:44,159
And this arch is not worked stone at all. You can actually see that it's gnawed.

2177
01:57:44,439 --> 01:57:53,359
The entire arc of it around is gnawed wood, up into a sort of portal-- Not of the mystical variety, obviously.

2178
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:55,255
AMY: Right. JERRY: Or the video game variety.

2179
01:57:55,539 --> 01:57:56,500
AMY: Right.

2180
01:57:56,805 --> 01:58:00,340
JERRY: But then you can see out there it's just a vast expanse.

2181
01:58:00,939 --> 01:58:04,659
AMY: Oh my god, well I'm like completely tantalized by this.

2182
01:58:04,659 --> 01:58:07,180
JERRY: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There is something delicious.

2183
01:58:08,475 --> 01:58:10,865
KATE: Is the deliciousness through that portal?

2184
01:58:10,864 --> 01:58:16,920
JERRY: You would not describe it as delicious. You would describe it as smelling primarily like musk and

2185
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:19,859
urine. It's not, you do not...

2186
01:58:19,859 --> 01:58:21,899
KRIS: So I'm-- so I start salivating.

2187
01:58:21,899 --> 01:58:25,139
JERRY: This does not turn your crank. This is not something grandmothers...

2188
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,560
This is like "One Trick that Grandmothers Hate."

2189
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:30,280
KATE: One Weird Trick. &gt;&gt; AMY: One Weird Trick. JERRY: One Weird Trick. &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah, okay.

2190
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:32,439
JERRY: Coat things in urine. Right?

2191
01:58:32,699 --> 01:58:35,760
KATE: Yeah we do hate that. JERRY: So obviously-- and you're getting wild.

2192
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:36,760
JERRY: You're like, "More filth!" RYAN: Something to eat?

2193
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:40,060
KRIS: Yeah, I'm fiending, I'm-- The bear's got to hold me back!

2194
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:42,420
JERRY: Let's continue to absorb it!

2195
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:44,460
Donaar.

2196
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:47,219
RYAN: Um...

2197
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,220
RYAN: Urine front? AMY: Mmhmm.

2198
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:51,380
RYAN: I'll just follow behind you. KATE: I heard it.

2199
01:58:51,539 --> 01:58:52,539
JERRY: Smooth. KATE: Yeah. Yeah, it's good.

2200
01:58:53,005 --> 01:58:55,465
AMY: I'mma keep going. What's this? JERRY: Absolutely.

2201
01:58:55,465 --> 01:59:09,360
JERRY: So this, the expanse out here, as I said is massive. Vast. It looks like an immense plain, and the

2202
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:16,739
ground recalls desert ground that is baked after a rain.

2203
01:59:16,739 --> 01:59:20,019
AMY: Okay. JERRY: There are long furrows.

2204
01:59:20,024 --> 01:59:24,179
JERRY: The difference between this and the desert ground is that they're all completely uniform.

2205
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:30,879
These furrows in the ground go out in sort of great rectangles out as far as you can see.

2206
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:36,000
But they're deep. I mean they would need to be stepped over in a pronounced way.

2207
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:41,020
They're not-- It's not obvious, it's not safe to travel around on these.

2208
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:42,900
They need to be jumped over individually.

2209
01:59:42,899 --> 01:59:48,519
AMY: Okay, well then I'm going to release myself from this bear-prison I'm in.

2210
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:49,240
JERRY: (laughs)

2211
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:52,400
AMY: Transform back into the Walnut you all know and love.

2212
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:55,019
JERRY: Yeah, the Classic Walnut. Walnut Classic! AMY: Classic! Classic Walnut.

2213
01:59:55,279 --> 01:59:57,539
JERRY: Walnut Classic. KATE: There's no nothing wrong with Classic Walnut.

2214
01:59:57,539 --> 01:59:58,779
JERRY: Absolutely.

2215
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:04,619
But this is-- I mean you are an expert in natural environments.

2216
02:00:04,619 --> 02:00:05,899
AMY: I am. JERRY: Surviving.

2217
02:00:05,899 --> 02:00:14,259
JERRY: You have-- as a basic obvious capacity for Walnut, you can feed five people.

2218
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:19,720
AMY: I was just about to say. JERRY: Straight out of your wisdom and knowledge.

2219
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:25,480
JERRY: You think you would have to customize your approach to this place.

2220
02:00:25,479 --> 02:00:29,679
There's a lot about it that does not mirror the natural world.

2221
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:31,800
KATE: What's the sky look like?

2222
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:33,940
JERRY: I'm so glad that you asked.

2223
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:38,380
You are an expert, obviously, we've gone over it.

2224
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:45,400
You have a uncanny capacity for identifying star patterns.

2225
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:50,260
You always, obsessively-- and there's a reason for it, right?

2226
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:55,539
You obsessively know where you are at all times. And you always know how to get home.

2227
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:59,720
There is only one constellation in the sky.

2228
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,880
And that is the Homeward Star.

2229
02:01:03,819 --> 02:01:10,000
KATE: And based on that constellation. What is it telling me as far as my orientation to my home?

2230
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:15,895
JERRY: The star that is at the point is blinking weakly.

2231
02:01:15,899 --> 02:01:18,659
KATE: Does it usually blink? Or is that unusual? JERRY: No.

2232
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,500
JERRY: That is quite unusual. KATE: Okay.

2233
02:01:21,819 --> 02:01:22,799
KATE: Okay.

2234
02:01:23,399 --> 02:01:25,899
KATE: Hmm... AMY: (laughs)

2235
02:01:25,899 --> 02:01:28,019
JERRY: But you should be able to orient.

2236
02:01:28,279 --> 02:01:31,800
JERRY: You should be able to orient the party from that. KATE: Great. I can do that.

2237
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:37,960
KATE: So based on the orientation of that constellation, am I inclined to go through the portal?

2238
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:40,980
JERRY: Through this gateway? &gt;&gt; KATE: Mmhmm. JERRY: Absolutely.

2239
02:01:40,979 --> 02:01:44,519
JERRY: My presumption is that you've already moved somewhat past that to examine this space.

2240
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:48,400
KATE: Okay... okay... So we are in the portal, we're in this new space.

2241
02:01:48,399 --> 02:01:51,139
JERRY: You've passed through this new doorway. KATE: All we see are the desert furrows--

2242
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:52,780
KATE: and this particular constellation?

2243
02:01:52,779 --> 02:02:01,539
JERRY: Exactly. In the distance you can see what you assume are trunks of trees, canopies of various kinds...

2244
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,740
But this is a bizarre natural environment, like I said.

2245
02:02:04,739 --> 02:02:09,300
KATE: Okay. I can-- so I will route us. I explain to you guys--

2246
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:11,920
JERRY: So do you want to collaborate with Walnut? KATE: Sure. Yeah.

2247
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:17,600
KATE: Yeah! So, I know star stuff. That star is acting whack.

2248
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:21,600
And I think I know exactly where we need to go, based on it.

2249
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,800
AMY: Well I trust you.

2250
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:28,500
KATE: Can you get us safely through this environment with these two treasured companions of ours?

2251
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:31,020
AMY: Yes, I will do my best.

2252
02:02:31,859 --> 02:02:34,359
KATE: We're going to go... this way! AMY: Don't want to disappoint.

2253
02:02:34,359 --> 02:02:35,920
RYAN: Am I still bark?:

2254
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:37,920
JERRY &amp; AMY: (whispers) No. KRIS: Oh, no.

2255
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,600
JERRY: It was a phase! RYAN: Oh, phew!

2256
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,480
JERRY: Right? It was just like your second album!

2257
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:43,859
You were trying bark!

2258
02:02:43,859 --> 02:02:45,859
AMY: Don't worry my bark's worse than my bite.

2259
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:48,159
JERRY: (wheezing laugh) KATE: Oh my gosh!

2260
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:51,099
RYAN: We got there everyone, we did it. Streams over! KATE: Beautiful. Yep.

2261
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:53,259
RYAN: Thanks everyone! Goodnight! This was great. Thanks everyone.

2262
02:02:53,479 --> 02:02:54,479
JERRY: No we're hanging it up.

2263
02:02:54,739 --> 02:02:56,515
JERRY: All right, no! KATE: And the party wipes!

2264
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:00,080
JERRY: No, exactly-- no, we're fine. RYAN: You get swallowed in a dune. The end.

2265
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:05,480
JERRY: So like I say. You're able to guide the party over these furrows.

2266
02:03:05,479 --> 02:03:06,859
AMY: Okay.

2267
02:03:06,939 --> 02:03:13,759
JERRY: But it is at about this point that you're starting to get hungry and thirsty.

2268
02:03:13,979 --> 02:03:17,479
AMY: Mmm okay. Okay...

2269
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:23,180
Well I can enable five companions to live off the land, but you said I would have maybe trouble doing that?

2270
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:27,460
AMY: Can I roll to see if that's possible? JERRY: Absolutely. Absolutely.

2271
02:03:27,899 --> 02:03:32,679
JERRY: You have a mystic dice if you'd like to employ it, but you can also hold onto it.

2272
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:33,880
AMY: I mean..

2273
02:03:36,119 --> 02:03:41,720
I don't know, I feel like Walnut would be-- wouldn't want to be distrustful of nature

2274
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:44,220
AMY: like not giving her what she wants?   JERRY: Yeah. I like it. I like it. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Wow.

2275
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:46,340
AMY: I don't think that this-- KRIS: That's RP!

2276
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:48,520
JERRY: That's 100%. AMY: That's deep roleplaying.

2277
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:52,220
JERRY: Yeah exactly!  AMY: All right, so would this be like a survial?

2278
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:54,220
JERRY: Yep exactly. AMY: Okay.

2279
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:55,760
AMY: Big money.

2280
02:03:55,779 --> 02:03:57,000
(groans)

2281
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,100
Uh... 12.

2282
02:03:58,819 --> 02:04:00,799
Well we said we'd have trouble!

2283
02:04:00,859 --> 02:04:04,539
JERRY: Exactly! I was going to say. You're not able to 100% map it.

2284
02:04:04,539 --> 02:04:11,420
You feel like you may have to travel for a bit and get a better sense of this environment.

2285
02:04:11,539 --> 02:04:13,960
KRIS: I ask-- and I say, "I don't want to be rude."

2286
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:18,914
"So I don't know the ways of the druid. But we all-- I think we're all getting a little bit hungry."

2287
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:25,020
"Is it possible to assume bear form, let us cleave off a little bit of that meat. grill it up."

2288
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:30,720
"And then, but not take you to zero health, and then you just come on back to regular Walnut stance."

2289
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:34,199
KRIS: "We just eat some of those bear cuts." KATE: Bear steak.

2290
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,960
RYAN: I think that's tough but fair. I weigh in, "Tough but bear."

2291
02:04:38,119 --> 02:04:39,599
JERRY: (snorts and laughs)

2292
02:04:40,859 --> 02:04:44,519
KRIS: "I don't know if that's like, if you get asked that a lot. So I mean I apologizeâ¦"

2293
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:45,520
KATE: Rosie is very... RYAN: Is that rude to ask?

2294
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,840
AMY: "Your drow humor is strange to me."

2295
02:04:49,539 --> 02:04:51,460
KATE: I'm going to say that's a no.

2296
02:04:51,539 --> 02:04:52,359
JERRY: Could be a no.

2297
02:04:52,359 --> 02:04:55,759
RYAN: So we die of starvation then? That's your answer? Just so I'm clear? Okay.

2298
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,400
AMY: I mean how dire is it?

2299
02:04:57,399 --> 02:04:58,799
JERRY: Yeah, it's not quite there yet.

2300
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,520
RYAN: So are you going to turn into a wolf? No? Like is this your setup?

2301
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:03,240
AMY: Bury the lede! They don't know what my forms are!

2302
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:05,140
KRIS: Bear-y...

2303
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:07,940
KATE: I have-- RYAN: Bear-y! She's going to turn into a...?

2304
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:09,739
KATE: All I have to offer is a bag of sand.

2305
02:05:09,739 --> 02:05:12,420
But I offer it anyway just in case anyone's gotten to that point of hunger.

2306
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:13,899
JERRY: To eat sand. KATE: Yeah.

2307
02:05:13,899 --> 02:05:17,599
KATE: It's all I have but I really don't like-- I'm a grandmother. I don't like it when people are going

2308
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:22,560
hungry. I want to offer anything I've got and it's all I've got. I also have paper.

2309
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,960
RYAN: I have toothbrush.

2310
02:05:24,359 --> 02:05:25,939
KATE: You brought a toothbrush?

2311
02:05:25,939 --> 02:05:28,519
RYAN: Yeah I bring a toothbrush everywhere. KATE: Wow.

2312
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:29,480
KRIS: I guess that's smart.

2313
02:05:29,479 --> 02:05:32,099
RYAN: Yeah I got a toothbrush and floss. AMY: Oh my...

2314
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:35,340
KATE: I'm a nasty granny. I didn't bring a toothbrush. JERRY: And floss? &gt;&gt; AMY: Toothbrush and floss.

2315
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:39,720
RYAN: I got acid breath, all right! And I got to keep-- take care of them pearly whites!

2316
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:40,880
JERRY: I got to maintain it.

2317
02:05:40,979 --> 02:05:42,899
RYAN: Don't neglect your gums, are you crazy? KATE: That's why that dragonborn lady was after you.

2318
02:05:42,899 --> 02:05:45,399
RYAN: If you could spit acid you'd be brushing your teeth all the time.

2319
02:05:45,399 --> 02:05:46,719
RYAN: Don't judge me! KATE: You can spit acid?

2320
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:48,640
RYAN: I just met you people! Don't judge me!

2321
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:51,680
JERRY: Just even while you're talking to people. It's just... listen...

2322
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:54,860
RYAN: In fact now that we got a little downtime, I pull that bad boy out.

2323
02:05:54,859 --> 02:05:56,099
JERRY: You're going to get use to this, it's fine.

2324
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:57,900
RYAN: I call my toothbrush Percival.

2325
02:05:57,899 --> 02:06:00,759
RYAN: I go (brushing noises), "Me and you, Percival. Forget these three."

2326
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:02,360
KRIS: Back at work, Percy.

2327
02:06:02,359 --> 02:06:06,399
KATE: So you have almost married a door and you're obsessively brushing your teeth.

2328
02:06:06,399 --> 02:06:10,059
JERRY: So Walnut your hope is that if you get near-- AMY: That's what I'm saying.

2329
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:11,720
JERRY: one of these trunks.

2330
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:13,440
JERRY: Some of this canopy. AMY: Scrape out some bugs.

2331
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:15,599
JERRY: You may be able to find something going on down there.

2332
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:17,920
AMY: I feel a lot of social pressure to provide...

2333
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:20,000
KATE: Yeah! AMY: for these people that I'm with.

2334
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,760
AMY: Okay so can we travel a little bit more. Can I try again?

2335
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:25,119
JERRY: Absolutely, yeah, yeah! I'd love to see some of that survival.

2336
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:29,000
AMY: And now Walnut feels betrayed...

2337
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,359
AMY: by the natural world. JERRY: By the natures?

2338
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:36,539
AMY: Looks up and just whispers... Iike... uh... you know... I want to use one of my mystical dice, basically.

2339
02:06:36,539 --> 02:06:38,279
KRIS: Come on! Come on plants!

2340
02:06:38,279 --> 02:06:43,019
AMY: "Please. Please, I have always been your champion. Give me something!"

2341
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:46,000
JERRY: "I druid nonstop. I'm always doing it."

2342
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,180
AMY: 100% on my grind. Everyday. Everyday!

2343
02:06:51,119 --> 02:06:54,119
AMY: One's a 15. Hang on.

2344
02:06:54,899 --> 02:06:57,279
And another one's a 15. So 20.

2345
02:06:57,279 --> 02:07:03,000
JERRY: 20? Oh that's marvelous. You guide the party toward...

2346
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:04,200
AMY: Pizza.

2347
02:07:04,199 --> 02:07:06,159
JERRY: These structures. RYAN: (laughs) Pizza tree.

2348
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:09,500
JERRY: Yeah exactly. To a food truck. KRIS: Hot n' Ready. Little Caesars. Oh boy.

2349
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:12,180
JERRY: They got the square pizza. They got the bread sticks!

2350
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:15,539
No! That doesn't exist yet! That hasn't been invented and it won't be invented for several thousand years.

2351
02:07:15,539 --> 02:07:17,739
So... I'm sorry. That's how it is.

2352
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:26,020
Your guess is that if you can sort of approach this loose copse over here,

2353
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:32,540
you'll be able to provide something for them but you don't actually know.

2354
02:07:33,359 --> 02:07:35,339
JERRY: Right, you're trying to-- AMY: Best guess?

2355
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:40,420
JERRY: Yeah exactly you're trying to apply your knowledge of this space to this.

2356
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:44,619
And as you approach it, these... are not trees.

2357
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:46,780
Like the closer you get to them, there's no--

2358
02:07:46,779 --> 02:07:48,840
AMY: I feel very betrayed!

2359
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:58,300
JERRY: There's no bark of any kind that surrounds them. They are wood! But they are not bark in any case.

2360
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:01,220
Near the base of them, though. This is the strange thing.

2361
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:03,420
JERRY: Near the base of them-- AMY: This is the strange thing.

2362
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:05,659
JERRY: Yeah exactly, this is actually the weirdest part.

2363
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,360
Umm... are...

2364
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:11,980
How do I even describe this?

2365
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:13,500
JERRY: They are-- AMY: That's how you know it's bad.

2366
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:14,560
JERRY: No, no, no.

2367
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:17,940
Maybe... basketball sized...

2368
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:21,559
hunks of crusty bread.

2369
02:08:22,859 --> 02:08:24,219
KATE: Take it. AMY: Hmm.

2370
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:25,539
KRIS: Hmm!

2371
02:08:25,659 --> 02:08:27,819
AMY: Wow! KATE: Do they smell good?

2372
02:08:27,939 --> 02:08:33,059
AMY: I just want to like-- JERRY: It's not new, but you could definitely eat it.

2373
02:08:33,159 --> 02:08:35,399
AMY: Having a flashback to when I said,

2374
02:08:35,399 --> 02:08:39,719
"Do I need to make a card for Purify Food and Water? I never will use that ever!"

2375
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,760
RYAN: I did the same thing, I passed on it.

2376
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:45,060
AMY: I said, "That's stupid who care's about eating?" KRIS: Is this-- are these at the base of every tree?

2377
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:48,420
JERRY: Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Near the-- KRIS: Or every tree-like object.

2378
02:08:48,420 --> 02:08:50,260
JERRY: Yeah, exactly! Exactly! KRIS: Huh.

2379
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:56,220
KATE: Okay so they're not new. I am proficient in history. Can I determine how old they are?

2380
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:57,340
AMY: Is that a history check?

2381
02:08:57,340 --> 02:09:01,319
JERRY: No! Culinary history? Food Network? RYAN: Can I intimidate?

2382
02:09:01,319 --> 02:09:06,460
JERRY: No. I would love to get some perception rolls from the party please.

2383
02:09:06,659 --> 02:09:10,559
RYAN: My perception ain't great. AMY: I want to perceive!

2384
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:14,699
AMY: 20! JERRY: Jeez!

2385
02:09:14,699 --> 02:09:16,859
KRIS: Yeah that one beats all. I was going to say 16.

2386
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:19,100
JERRY: Yeah! what's this? It's garbage! RYAN: 13.

2387
02:09:19,239 --> 02:09:21,319
(laughter)

2388
02:09:21,539 --> 02:09:28,560
JERRY: It's filth! So, here's the thing. So your ears perk up. Your elven ears perk up instantaneously.

2389
02:09:28,899 --> 02:09:34,839
What's more! At the 20 you're not even surprised by what it is. You know exactly what it is.

2390
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:38,600
It is the sound of claws on wood.

2391
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:47,180
And then edging out from behind these tall wooden pillars...

2392
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:50,020
you can see...

2393
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:54,539
what appear to be gigantic mice.

2394
02:09:54,539 --> 02:09:55,939
(chuckling)

2395
02:09:55,939 --> 02:09:58,199
RYAN: You love those. AMY: I told you!

2396
02:09:58,439 --> 02:10:00,859
AMY: It was nothing but mice! (laughs) KATE: She did tell us.

2397
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:04,655
AMY: Okay gigantic mice. Like how big? For like..

2398
02:10:04,659 --> 02:10:07,479
AMY: I mean like bear size? Or car size? Or bus size? KRIS: Like classical "gigantic"?

2399
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:11,479
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would say like a bear. AMY: Godzilla size? Okay.

2400
02:10:11,819 --> 02:10:13,439
KRIS: Big mouse. RYAN: That is a big mouse.

2401
02:10:13,439 --> 02:10:16,819
AMY: Okay so how far off? RYAN: I wonder...

2402
02:10:17,039 --> 02:10:25,939
JERRY: From here they're maybe 50 feet... 50 to 60 feet away. There are several of them that you can hear.

2403
02:10:25,939 --> 02:10:31,179
Because it was a 20 I'm going to say this is information that you got.

2404
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:33,659
And you can see right now it's like--

2405
02:10:34,060 --> 02:10:42,635
Your sense is that they're not hostile but you can't imagine what you must look like.

2406
02:10:42,635 --> 02:10:45,695
KATE: Yeah so Rosie will lean over... AMY: Mmhmm. Okay so I'm pointing this out.

2407
02:10:45,699 --> 02:10:48,500
KATE:  Yeah, yeah. I'm going to say, "Tell them I said, 'What's up?'"

2408
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:53,220
AMY: I go, "I can only do that once per day."

2409
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:54,699
KATE: "Ah we need a short rest.

2410
02:10:54,699 --> 02:10:58,239
AMY: "It's not unlimited." KATE: Oh okay.

2411
02:10:58,319 --> 02:11:04,039
AMY: I can tell these creatures that we mean them no harm. Or I can attempt to if they're not so smart.

2412
02:11:04,539 --> 02:11:07,880
AMY: But do we want to risk going that close? JERRY: How would you do it?

2413
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:09,619
JERRY: How would you do that, roleplayer?

2414
02:11:09,939 --> 02:11:15,739
AMY: With Animal Friendship but I would have to approach by 20 feet and signal to them...

2415
02:11:15,739 --> 02:11:16,979
JERRY: Interesting!

2416
02:11:16,979 --> 02:11:18,819
AMY: It is a beast. KRIS: And do a classic-- like a mouse...

2417
02:11:18,819 --> 02:11:20,939
AMY: "Whoa! Whoa, girl!" KRIS: gesture!

2418
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:22,520
JERRY: Do the classic-- do the classic mouse...

2419
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:25,560
KRIS: You got to get up high like that. AMY: Walnut, Tamer of Mice.

2420
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:28,560
JERRY: The classic mouse sign of friendship. AMY: All right,  let me try it.

2421
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,039
KATE: Yeah because I want to get on that bread.

2422
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:33,815
AMY: So I want to intervene for the party so they can grab at that bread.

2423
02:11:33,814 --> 02:11:37,054
And I want to get within 30 feet of these mice.

2424
02:11:37,375 --> 02:11:40,204
AMY: It must see and hear me. JERRY: Do you have bread with you?

2425
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:42,079
AMY: Do I have bread with me?

2426
02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:45,000
JERRY: Yeah I want to make sure I understand who's got what, where they are--

2427
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,079
AMY: I do not have any food items on me when I approach these gigantic beasts.

2428
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:50,660
KRIS: Same.

2429
02:11:50,659 --> 02:11:52,460
AMY: I'm in my cheese suit-- No!

2430
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:54,260
(laughter)

2431
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:56,579
JERRY: Head to toe. It's come in handy! AMY: Head to toe.

2432
02:11:56,579 --> 02:11:59,420
AMY: Chedder! So if the intelligence is less than--

2433
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:01,539
KRIS: Your Fro-mage Armor.

2434
02:12:01,539 --> 02:12:03,060
(laughter)

2435
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:05,980
KATE: She's trying to do a-- &gt;&gt; AMY: I hate it! JERRY: You're a monster!

2436
02:12:05,979 --> 02:12:09,500
AMY: It was good enough to sneak in. It's okay to interrupt me for those good jokes.

2437
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:10,720
KRIS: I'm sorry.

2438
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:14,020
AMY: If the beast's intelligence is four or higher the spell fails.

2439
02:12:14,359 --> 02:12:18,179
Otherwise it must succeed on an wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you.

2440
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:21,700
But if one of you guys hurt it the spell ends. Please don't.

2441
02:12:22,359 --> 02:12:23,359
KATE: Okay

2442
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:25,160
JERRY: So you're going to try it?

2443
02:12:25,159 --> 02:12:26,519
AMY: Try it, yes. JERRY: Okay.

2444
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:30,939
AMY: So is it... is it real smart?

2445
02:12:31,079 --> 02:12:35,079
JERRY: No. It's a mouse. AMY: Okay. Well I didn't know if this was like some like--

2446
02:12:35,079 --> 02:12:37,840
AMY: psionic... ability...

2447
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:38,940
JERRY: Mage rats!

2448
02:12:38,939 --> 02:12:40,659
AMY: I don't know! It's D&amp;D!

2449
02:12:40,659 --> 02:12:43,659
KRIS: It rises up on its two-- AMY: Big mouse, big brain, right?

2450
02:12:43,659 --> 02:12:47,399
KATE: It's just a mouse. AMY: Okay, so I want to...

2451
02:12:47,399 --> 02:12:51,179
AMY: All right now that I've convinced it, you know like, steadying the beast!

2452
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:52,000
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2453
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,920
AMY: We mean you no harm. We are simply here to get nourishment and pass through.

2454
02:12:56,920 --> 02:13:01,140
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You see a couple more mice peeking out.

2455
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:03,020
AMY: "Get the bread guys!"

2456
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:07,500
"It is imperative that you now get your food and we be on our way."

2457
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:10,100
KATE: Rosie suddenly realizes we're in a Honey, I Shrunk The Kids situation.

2458
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:12,120
KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KATE: Okay. AMY: And with no Antie.

2459
02:13:12,119 --> 02:13:16,220
KRIS: I was taking a break to see when it was appropriate to interrupt with that.

2460
02:13:16,239 --> 02:13:19,599
But I'm that glad more than one person came to this.

2461
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:24,300
KATE: I see, I see. Wonderful. Okay! So you said, "What's up?" to the mouse?

2462
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:27,460
AMY: I said, "What's up?" to the mice and I look at over my shoulder at you and say,

2463
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:29,199
"Please get your food so we can continue."

2464
02:13:29,199 --> 02:13:33,599
KATE: Okay I'm going to run in there, grab as much bread as I can,

2465
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:37,700
but also tear half of it off and throw it to the mice.

2466
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:41,375
KATE: And run back. AMY: Great. Aggro the mice.

2467
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:44,300
JERRY: Yeah! &gt;&gt; AMY: Thank you. KATE: They love bread!

2468
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:46,539
JERRY: They're into it.

2469
02:13:46,739 --> 02:13:49,880
KRIS: It's bread! RYAN: Hey don't fill up on it though!

2470
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:52,079
JERRY: Optimally you don't fill up on the bread. RYAN: Don't fill up on bread.

2471
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:57,720
JERRY: So you grab that hunk. And you sort of underhand it out into the area.

2472
02:13:57,899 --> 02:13:59,939
Three mice go for the same piece.

2473
02:13:59,939 --> 02:14:01,719
KATE: Mmhmm. AMY: Oh no.

2474
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:04,359
AMY: Do not feed the animals!

2475
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:06,760
KATE: Maybe you all could go get some and help me--

2476
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:08,960
KATE: and put some crumbs out there.  RYAN: I am lumbering and slow.

2477
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:16,260
KRIS: Are you really? Oh yeah you took a little less speed. All right I'll run through as best as I can.

2478
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:20,980
As far from the mice as I can. And I'll get a crumb.

2479
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:25,320
AMY: A basketball sized crumb. KRIS: It's like this! &gt;&gt; JERRY: Yeah. This big.

2480
02:14:25,319 --> 02:14:29,500
KATE: It's like this? &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: There is this process of her...

2481
02:14:29,859 --> 02:14:34,179
JERRY: maintaining the diplomacy with the mice. KATE &amp; KRIS: Jurassic World!

2482
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:37,140
JERRY: Maintaining mouse diplomacy. AMY: Very cool!

2483
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:41,860
JERRY: While you guys are cycling back and forth grabbing as many crumbs.

2484
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,279
JERRY: Watching a dwindling supply-- AMY: Much like mice.

2485
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:48,259
JERRY: Watching a dwindling supply of their own food.

2486
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:51,400
You've pitched it out and then...

2487
02:14:52,739 --> 02:14:59,760
ultimately, once they have been satisfied, the largest of the mice comes over to you, Walnut,

2488
02:14:59,899 --> 02:15:02,659
and just gives you the maximum sniff.

2489
02:15:03,479 --> 02:15:06,459
AMY: I stand tall and remain calm. JERRY: Maximum sniff.

2490
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:10,819
AMY: Very calm. JERRY: These whiskers... they're all over.

2491
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:14,260
JERRY: This situation is very tickley.

2492
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:16,439
KRIS: It's like Percival.

2493
02:15:16,439 --> 02:15:17,719
JERRY: It's dry!

2494
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:20,579
RYAN: That's my toothbrush! KRIS: Toothbrush. I remember.

2495
02:15:20,579 --> 02:15:23,619
AMY: Okay it isn't a wet sniff. JERRY: This is not a wet sniff.

2496
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:25,579
JERRY: The nose very cold.

2497
02:15:27,159 --> 02:15:31,079
At this point after this sniff is thoroughly sniffed,

2498
02:15:32,739 --> 02:15:36,219
when he leaves, the rest leave with him.

2499
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:42,380
You're thinking it might be time for something along the lines of a long rest.

2500
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,659
AMY: Okay. JERRY: It might be time to get your bearings.

2501
02:15:46,659 --> 02:15:50,920
JERRY: Try to get some food together. Put together a fire situation.

2502
02:15:51,199 --> 02:15:54,199
KATE: We feel like the mice are cool with us being here?

2503
02:15:54,199 --> 02:15:58,119
AMY: I feel that they're okay. KRIS: It's a test!

2504
02:15:58,119 --> 02:16:00,340
JERRY: Your read is good. KATE: Okay.

2505
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:02,980
AMY: I think we should make camp here. RYAN: Make camp?

2506
02:16:02,979 --> 02:16:06,339
KRIS: I think we should make camp further from the rug.

2507
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,619
(laughter)

2508
02:16:07,619 --> 02:16:11,994
Not in sight of a rug in the establishment.

2509
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,880
KATE: Let's do it here where the solid floor. KRIS: Yeah.

2510
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:17,900
KATE: Is there a mouse hole that we can go into? Can we follow them into like a cave?

2511
02:16:17,899 --> 02:16:20,500
RYAN: No, I don't want to do that. AMY: I can't talk to them yet.

2512
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:23,699
RYAN: Never follow a mouse to a second location. That's rule number one.

2513
02:16:23,699 --> 02:16:25,139
(laughing)

2514
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:26,800
JERRY: Is that mice wisdom? RYAN: Oh yeah.

2515
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:30,300
KRIS: Oh yeah. JERRY: Exactly. Big book of mice wisdom. All right!

2516
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:38,860
JERRY: So yeah. It's a situation where you're thinking with your survival approach

2517
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:44,560
that you should be able to shave off hunks of these pillars

2518
02:16:44,559 --> 02:16:49,239
and try to build yourself a small fire underneath this canopy.

2519
02:16:49,559 --> 02:16:52,459
Which you now tihnk is probably not a canopy at all.

2520
02:16:53,659 --> 02:16:56,899
AMY: All right. Okay. RYAN: We're super tiny.

2521
02:16:57,700 --> 02:17:02,300
AMY: So I guess we got to get to sir with the greatsword.

2522
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:05,739
Can we shave off some stuff? Get a fire going. You want to help me?

2523
02:17:05,739 --> 02:17:08,619
RYAN: Uh... Yeah I got a big old sword.   AMY: Come on, big guy.

2524
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:11,660
JERRY: It's going to take some doing. RYAN: Yeah, I can do that.

2525
02:17:11,659 --> 02:17:15,600
KRIS: Is this hemp rug? By chance?

2526
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:19,960
KATE: This table legs? I tihnk those are table legs. KRIS: Okay, that's possible. Yeah.

2527
02:17:20,719 --> 02:17:23,340
JERRY: You got it. All right. So!

2528
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:26,280
AMY: Oh my god! And the lighbulb comes on!

2529
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:30,060
Kris: Finally. AMY: It was like phew phew phew! The whole itme!

2530
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:39,959
JERRY: So this is how it goes: you're able to, with the edge of it, shave of slivers.

2531
02:17:39,959 --> 02:17:43,839
Enough slivers of wood for you to build a fire. Put it together.

2532
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:50,460
There's enough bits of cheese and meat and bread that have collected down in these furrows.

2533
02:17:50,459 --> 02:17:53,239
KRIS: Charcuterie. Filthy. JERRY: For you to go to work!

2534
02:17:53,239 --> 02:17:55,159
JERRY: Right? AMY: You love it!

2535
02:17:55,479 --> 02:18:00,139
JERRY: It's like this, so long rest. You regain your hit points.

2536
02:18:00,559 --> 02:18:01,979
KATE: Yes! Phew.

2537
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:05,659
AMY: And all your spells. I mean I only needed a short rest.

2538
02:18:05,659 --> 02:18:07,979
JERRY: No. RYAN: Yeah no, I didn't got all my spells.

2539
02:18:07,979 --> 02:18:10,680
KATE: Rosie gives all her cheese and meat to Donaar.

2540
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:12,940
RYAN: Aww. No you don't have to do that.    KATE: She's a monk, it's bread and water.

2541
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:16,640
RYAN:I insist! KATE: Ah you know. I'm 120. I weigh 28 pounds.

2542
02:18:16,639 --> 02:18:18,599
KATE: I'm all about the bread and water. It's fine.

2543
02:18:19,899 --> 02:18:21,420
JERRY: About halfway through the night...

2544
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:22,540
AMY: Uh oh.

2545
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:23,739
RYAN: Ugh.

2546
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:25,879
JERRY: No, it's okay. It's all right.

2547
02:18:25,979 --> 02:18:28,859
AMY: Ah... We didn't do watch. JERRY: Exactly.

2548
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:32,280
JERRY: Everyone else is resting. It's your turn.

2549
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:36,380
KRIS: Oh wait a minute, hold on though. Halfway through the night, I only am in a trance.

2550
02:18:36,379 --> 02:18:37,459
JERRY: It takes four hours for you?

2551
02:18:37,459 --> 02:18:38,599
KRIS: It's four hours, yeah. AMY: Same.

2552
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:40,920
JERRY: Yep, yep. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. AMY: Elfs. (raspberry)

2553
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:44,059
JERRY: High five on that. &gt;&gt; AMY: Yeah, well... KRIS: I'll take second trance.

2554
02:18:44,059 --> 02:18:46,819
KRIS: You take first, I'll take second. JERRY: Smooth. Perfect.

2555
02:18:46,819 --> 02:18:50,379
JERRY: So there's a period there in the middle where you're both awake. You just pass each other.

2556
02:18:50,379 --> 02:18:52,159
JERRY: I'm done! AMY: Ships in the night.

2557
02:18:52,319 --> 02:18:56,779
JERRY: But Donaar I would like to get a perception roll from you.

2558
02:18:56,780 --> 02:19:00,300
RYAN: (groans) My perception sucks. JERRY: That's great! I'm glad it does.

2559
02:19:00,299 --> 02:19:02,079
KRIS: You're sleeping. RYAN: 14!

2560
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:05,260
RYAN: 14. I get nothing on wisdom. JERRY: You get no juice?

2561
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:08,760
RYAN: No. I'm flat. So just 14.

2562
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:12,680
JERRY: It's not as much of a sound as just as a sense.

2563
02:19:13,079 --> 02:19:20,100
Just a dull vibration that you can feel sort of in the panels of the ground.

2564
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:28,219
You're not able to place it. And you're not able to identify the source of it.

2565
02:19:28,379 --> 02:19:29,939
RYAN: Am I the only one who feels it?

2566
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:32,140
JERRY: Yeah at this point. RYAN: Okay.

2567
02:19:34,639 --> 02:19:36,699
JERRY: The morning occurs.

2568
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:41,760
You can see light coming through the shafts of what you now realize are the windows.

2569
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:50,380
The celestial configuration of the chandelier, still useful, still directing.

2570
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:59,840
But you know that it might be more than a day at this scale to get to where you're trying to go.

2571
02:20:01,479 --> 02:20:06,719
JERRY: It is at this point when you guys are collecting your gear and putting your equipment back together,

2572
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:13,640
that another diplomatic group of mice...

2573
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:14,920
(laughter)

2574
02:20:15,219 --> 02:20:18,459
JERRY: approach the group. AMY: And I'm ready for them.

2575
02:20:19,579 --> 02:20:23,020
AMY: So I look at these mice and I use Speak with Animals.

2576
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:24,420
JERRY: Speak with Animals?

2577
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:26,399
AMY: You say, surprised!

2578
02:20:26,899 --> 02:20:29,779
JERRY: What's that? What's that, Walnut Dankgrass!

2579
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:35,360
AMY: So anyway. I got another ten minutes with these mice and I say...

2580
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:39,420
JERRY: They come up and it's all noses.  Except this time all four of them come up--

2581
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:42,680
AMY: And I'm sniffing back. JERRY: Direct nose contact.

2582
02:20:42,684 --> 02:20:45,334
JERRY: Exactly right. AMY: Ah four of them.

2583
02:20:45,334 --> 02:20:47,364
AMY: And I say to them-- I say,

2584
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:52,799
"Good mice friends. Thank you for letting us stay in your realm."

2585
02:20:54,559 --> 02:21:02,500
"My companions and I are trying to make it through. I was wondering if you could--"

2586
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:04,760
JERRY: Before you finish your sentence...

2587
02:21:05,879 --> 02:21:12,879
there's a moment where you realize that the largest mouse that you saw is not there anymore.

2588
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:19,639
And the one that rubbed noses last says, "Our queen is dead."

2589
02:21:21,139 --> 02:21:25,859
AMY: And I look back and I go, "Ah..."

2590
02:21:26,079 --> 02:21:30,280
JERRY: "We have stories of far mice."

2591
02:21:30,559 --> 02:21:37,239
"Mice from the hole that come through from time to time and help us with great tasks."

2592
02:21:37,559 --> 02:21:38,359
AMY: Mmhmm.

2593
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:40,780
Oh!

2594
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:43,600
"We are your far mice... today."

2595
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:46,540
JERRY: Yeah and he looks like, "I fucking told you these were far mice."

2596
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:55,120
AMY: And then I look back at these guys, I'm like, "We got a mouse quest situation."

2597
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:57,320
JERRY: Situation we got to fucking deal with!

2598
02:21:57,979 --> 02:22:03,059
AMY: I go, "But I think we can curry favor with these mice if we do them their small task."

2599
02:22:03,059 --> 02:22:05,500
"How much could it be?"

2600
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:08,780
RYAN: Can we ride them? &gt;&gt; KATE: They're mice. AMY: Maybe after we help them.

2601
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:13,239
AMY: Oh actually, I say, "Mice, of course we're here to help you. We are far mice."

2602
02:22:13,239 --> 02:22:18,520
"Can you take us to the problem so that we might help you?"

2603
02:22:19,079 --> 02:22:23,000
JERRY: "The problem may come to us."

2604
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:26,620
AMY: "What-- Did you see what killed your queen?"

2605
02:22:26,819 --> 02:22:28,520
JERRY: "What *ate* our queen."

2606
02:22:29,879 --> 02:22:31,679
KATE: Your old friend.

2607
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:33,899
AMY: We don't know that! We don't know that!

2608
02:22:33,899 --> 02:22:36,059
KRIS: I think you might know that. KATE: I think we might know. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

2609
02:22:36,059 --> 02:22:40,079
KRIS: We seem to know that here. KATE: We all know it. Walnut's in denial.

2610
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:44,059
JERRY: Yeah yeah. And then the whispers from the other mice--

2611
02:22:44,059 --> 02:22:50,760
behind the one that you're having the parlay with-- say, (whispers) "Onyx. Onyx."

2612
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:52,000
KATE: (gasps)

2613
02:22:53,059 --> 02:22:58,100
AMY: Hmm. So I have a sinking feeling. But I say...

2614
02:22:59,360 --> 02:23:00,260
"Well..."

2615
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:02,180
God!

2616
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:03,639
AMY: Um... (laughter)

2617
02:23:03,719 --> 02:23:05,420
I don't know what I say!

2618
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:07,760
Walnut's like, (sucks in breath) "Oh...!"

2619
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:11,059
(everyone makes nervous noises)

2620
02:23:11,299 --> 02:23:14,579
KATE: Do you want to like life line to us? Like let us know what's going on?

2621
02:23:14,579 --> 02:23:19,000
AMY: Yeah I go, "Let me speak to my companions." JERRY: Hey listen, I know some people.

2622
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,780
KATE: Talk to the other far mice. AMY: "The other far mice. Hold. hold please."

2623
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:29,560
AMY: And I look back and I say, "So... I don't know if you would remember but,"

2624
02:23:29,579 --> 02:23:32,299
"I met the acquaintance of a cat."

2625
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:34,819
KATE: Rosie is way into it. "Yes, I remember."

2626
02:23:34,819 --> 02:23:40,940
KRIS: "We've been in this room for like two days now. I remember everything!"

2627
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:43,280
RYAN: "I'll never, ever forget this."

2628
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:45,260
JERRY: It's not possible.

2629
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:48,520
RYAN: "You're talking about the cat who delivered the identical mice you stared at for 25 minutes?"

2630
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:50,360
AMY: "Right, right, right." RYAN: "Yeah I remember that."

2631
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:53,319
AMY: "I believe that that is their queen." KRIS: "Yeah it kind of stayed with me."

2632
02:23:53,319 --> 02:23:57,139
KATE: "The dead mouse that Onyx was killing?" AMY: "I believe that was their queen."

2633
02:23:57,139 --> 02:23:58,359
RYAN: "Twice."

2634
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:02,780
AMY: "Listen it doesn't matter how many times! It just happened! Whatever happened it happened!"

2635
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:11,120
"And I think we can get these mice to help carry us but we... I don't know."

2636
02:24:11,299 --> 02:24:13,379
KATE: "It sounds like they want us to kill Onyx."

2637
02:24:13,379 --> 02:24:17,019
RYAN: "Does every franchisee have to go through this?" AMY: "Is this just hazing?"

2638
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:20,800
RYAN: "Yeah what did we do wrong? What did we do to make them so mad?"

2639
02:24:20,799 --> 02:24:26,059
KATE: Hey! Consider this! Consider that the nuts, the acorns were sent by these mice..."

2640
02:24:26,719 --> 02:24:27,879
That they're the ones who summoned us.

2641
02:24:27,879 --> 02:24:31,319
JERRY: Yeah the Acquisitions Incorporated-- KATE: This is the job, ladies and gentlemen!

2642
02:24:31,459 --> 02:24:35,274
JERRY: Acquisitions Incorporated is operated-- owned and operated by mice!

2643
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:40,579
RYAN: By mice people behind the scenes. Holy shit. AMY: That was the secret purpose. It's been revealed.

2644
02:24:40,579 --> 02:24:47,760
AMY: "Well I don't feel comfortable murdering a cat that I've become friends with."

2645
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:51,840
KRIS: "So your going to sit this one--" RYAN: "I murdered a door that I became 'friends' with."

2646
02:24:51,899 --> 02:24:53,920
(laughing)

2647
02:24:53,959 --> 02:24:56,139
AMY: Uh... RYAN: My betrothed!

2648
02:24:56,139 --> 02:24:57,519
(laughter)

2649
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:02,079
JERRY: I interacted with a door in a way unbecoming a gentleman!

2650
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:09,680
AMY: "If we can get the cat here now, I could talk to him. But it would have to be now. We have to act quickly."

2651
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:11,100
KRIS: "All right we'll just act delicious then."

2652
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:14,280
RYAN: Yeah I was going to say, "Look tasty?" KRIS: "She's just going to come around."

2653
02:25:14,319 --> 02:25:18,459
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: You had a suggestion about riding, is that..?

2654
02:25:18,459 --> 02:25:22,819
RYAN: Oh... Yeah. KATE: Can they carry us to where Onyx hangs out?

2655
02:25:22,819 --> 02:25:25,539
KRIS: Yeah bring us closer, or are they willing?

2656
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:31,360
AMY: Yeah or hear me out. Just an alternate idea.

2657
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:33,060
AMY: We tell them-- JERRY: This is the sequel.

2658
02:25:33,059 --> 02:25:39,199
AMY: their queen is gone they must find another queen. If they come with us-- also maybe we're riding them.

2659
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:41,560
KRIS: Wow. You're just going to lie to them. RYAN: Wow.

2660
02:25:41,559 --> 02:25:44,175
KRIS: Instead of kill a cat you're just going to lie to them. RYAN: Are you going to offer to be queen of the mice?

2661
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:45,780
KRIS: The queen's actually fine! AMY: I didn't use Animal Friendship!

2662
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:48,760
AMY: I used Speak with Animals! I don't owe them anything.

2663
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:52,700
KATE: Yeah! that's right! Let's lie to these mice! AMY: They could be magic mice!

2664
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:54,620
RYAN: I got no problem lying to a mouse. KATE: It's fine.

2665
02:25:54,620 --> 02:25:58,220
KRIS: Honestly, I don't either. Lie to the mouse. Kill the cat. I'm game.

2666
02:25:58,219 --> 02:26:00,799
JERRY: That's not against my personal morality. KRIS: Anything we need to do.

2667
02:26:00,799 --> 02:26:07,579
KATE: Yeah, what if we tell them that Onyx hangs out at the door. Ride them there. And then so long, suckers!

2668
02:26:07,579 --> 02:26:08,659
AMY: Oh, well no I didn't mean that. KATE: Peace out. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

2669
02:26:08,659 --> 02:26:13,979
AMY: I mean their best chance of survival is getting away from the cat and finding a new queen.

2670
02:26:13,979 --> 02:26:16,260
JERRY: I'm having the best time! RYAN: Who cares?

2671
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:18,700
JERRY: This is what I wanted! RYAN: These are mice! It's not Steven Hawking!

2672
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:20,420
AMY: I'm a druid!

2673
02:26:20,420 --> 02:26:22,659
KRIS: You don't deserve to be a franchisee-- Okay...!

2674
02:26:22,659 --> 02:26:24,319
RYAN: Yeah! You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2675
02:26:24,319 --> 02:26:26,940
JERRY: Okay, all right. It got heated Let's table this for now.

2676
02:26:26,940 --> 02:26:27,899
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: Sorry.

2677
02:26:29,139 --> 02:26:33,459
AMY: Okay. All right I just want to see how the mice feel about this. I look back at the mice and I go,

2678
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:37,420
"Your queen is dead. It is no longer safe for you here."

2679
02:26:37,579 --> 02:26:46,219
JERRY: You just see their-- You just see... just a wave of fur like just back-- like they just react to that.

2680
02:26:46,219 --> 02:26:50,059
Just physically you just see it roll over their backs.

2681
02:26:50,379 --> 02:26:55,319
They're just looking at each other like, "These are the far mice? Really?"

2682
02:26:55,319 --> 02:26:56,260
KATE: Uh oh.

2683
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:58,620
JERRY: No, no. Do your shit. I'm just giving you information.

2684
02:26:58,620 --> 02:27:00,940
AMY: No, no. I know. RYAN: All right.

2685
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:12,239
AMY: "If you wish to seek a new home, and a new queen, and a new--" What do mice live in? "Hole."

2686
02:27:12,879 --> 02:27:15,079
JERRY: Fucking mouse shit. AMY: Whatever.

2687
02:27:15,719 --> 02:27:22,500
AMY: "We can guide-- We can give you safe passage if you come with us to the far lands over there."

2688
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:23,940
JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. KATE: And carry us on your backs.

2689
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:28,300
JERRY: They chatter. I mean they all sort of chitter to each other. It's like,

2690
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:34,559
"Well the last far mice went back on their promise."

2691
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:37,960
RYAN: So will we!

2692
02:27:38,719 --> 02:27:41,819
JERRY: You got some persuade?

2693
02:27:41,819 --> 02:27:44,520
JERRY: Let's see what we're talking about. KATE: Mouse liars. &gt;&gt; AMY: I... really...

2694
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:47,120
RYAN: I say, (whisper) "We won't do that. (loudly) Yes we will."

2695
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:50,340
"Oh, I said the loud part quiet, and the quiet part loud."

2696
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:53,880
KATE: The mice can't talk to us! RYAN: Yeah I know. I can insult them to their face.

2697
02:27:53,879 --> 02:27:56,859
AMY: Walnut genuinely wants to-- JERRY: Make your case and let's see how it goes, right?

2698
02:27:56,860 --> 02:27:59,980
JERRY: I mean you got... you got time.

2699
02:27:59,979 --> 02:28:04,459
AMY: Oh man, I would love if someone could just like, I don't know, like guide me here.

2700
02:28:04,459 --> 02:28:09,319
JERRY: Well here-- We can have-- He can-- He's got sick charisma.

2701
02:28:09,319 --> 02:28:10,940
AMY: Okay. RYAN: I can't talk to mice.

2702
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:15,399
JERRY: No but you can try to cut a deal. You can try to...

2703
02:28:15,799 --> 02:28:18,879
RYAN: I can say, but use you as the proxy. Be like here's what...

2704
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:21,139
KATE: Say it just like this. RYAN: Yeah here's what you say.

2705
02:28:21,139 --> 02:28:23,019
RYAN: I've got to be your Cyrano de-- AMY: Cyrano de Bergerac.

2706
02:28:23,020 --> 02:28:31,220
RYAN: Cyrano de Mice! Cyrano de Whiskers. JERRY: You all occupy some position in their culture.

2707
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:36,120
JERRY: This is weird stuff.  You know what I mean?

2708
02:28:36,225 --> 02:28:37,975
JERRY: But, you're welcome to-- AMY: Sure...

2709
02:28:37,979 --> 02:28:41,199
JERRY: but you can confer with your friend, your ally. RYAN, KATE &amp; KRIS: Yeah.

2710
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,560
AMY: "Friends" is... "Friends" is... RYAN: Yeah. "Friends." We just met.

2711
02:28:43,565 --> 02:28:46,020
KRIS: Do you have Guidance? If you want Guidance I also have Guidance.

2712
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:46,715
RYAN: Yeah.

2713
02:28:46,715 --> 02:28:48,840
KATE: I can also do somebody. KRIS: If you just want to go rogue, again.

2714
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:50,760
RYAN: I can Intimidate. KATE: I'm terrifying.

2715
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:52,860
AMY: If you've got good charisma, let's go for it.   JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

2716
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:55,220
RYAN: I have good charisma. JERRY: Go ahead and just--

2717
02:28:55,219 --> 02:28:57,000
RYAN: What's our sticking point here?

2718
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,180
JERRY: Just build the case, you're just trying to build--

2719
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:02,079
KRIS: You got to convince the mice. JERRY: Build rapport with the mice.

2720
02:29:02,079 --> 02:29:04,120
JERRY: And then you'll roll Guidance? KRIS: Yeah.

2721
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:05,440
JERRY: So roll a d4.

2722
02:29:05,479 --> 02:29:07,379
KRIS: Yeah let me give you some of that.

2723
02:29:07,379 --> 02:29:09,279
KRIS: Where's the color... It's black! JERRY: It's the evil pyramid.

2724
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:11,020
KRIS: Tough to see. RYAN: We got one minute. &gt;&gt; AMY: It's okay.

2725
02:29:11,020 --> 02:29:12,420
KRIS: It's a trash roll.

2726
02:29:12,985 --> 02:29:14,915
JERRY: It's a one. All right. KRIS: You're going to enjoy a one.

2727
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:16,760
AMY: Okay. RYAN: What am I rolling?

2728
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:18,000
KRIS: A very confident one. AMY: You're rolling your--

2729
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,620
JERRY: You don't have to roll but you need to tell me if you want to help her.

2730
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:22,800
You need to tell me what you're conferring to her.

2731
02:29:22,799 --> 02:29:33,039
RYAN: All right. I will use my charisma and knowledge of mice abounds. So you talk to the mice and you said...

2732
02:29:33,659 --> 02:29:36,520
You made the case that their queen was gone and they didn't like that.

2733
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:37,540
KRIS: That case doesn't need to be made.

2734
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:40,420
RYAN: And they're not down with taking us across to the far lands?

2735
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:42,180
JERRY: We don't know. She's trying to make the case. AMY: They're worried...

2736
02:29:42,180 --> 02:29:46,220
AMY: They're worried that we're going to go back on their promise, and I have to tell you...

2737
02:29:47,245 --> 02:29:52,895
I do feel obligated to help them in some way, and part of me does feel like this is a way to help.

2738
02:29:52,895 --> 02:29:55,954
RYAN: All right. Maybe you should go to Kris first because all I want to do is lie to them.

2739
02:29:55,954 --> 02:29:59,055
JERRY: No, no, no. Lies are good. Guidance is going to help on the roll.

2740
02:29:59,055 --> 02:30:01,120
You communicate it to her and she'll do the roll.

2741
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:02,275
JERRY: What's the case? KRIS: You don't...

2742
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:05,079
KRIS: Oh okay. If you're still working, all right. KATE: Let's hear the pitch.

2743
02:30:05,079 --> 02:30:08,799
RYAN: Ah I thought that was a good pitch before. KRIS: Let me jump in there.

2744
02:30:08,799 --> 02:30:11,599
KRIS: You don't want to kill this cat. RYAN: Yeah.

2745
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:13,120
AMY: I don't want to kill the cat. KRIS: How do you feel about--

2746
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:15,540
KRIS: driving it irretrievably insane?

2747
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:17,300
(laughing)

2748
02:30:17,299 --> 02:30:19,379
KRIS: It's still a cat. AMY: Well, it's a cat. &gt;&gt; RYAN: I like that.

2749
02:30:19,379 --> 02:30:20,599
KRIS: Still lives. RYAN: Still breathing.

2750
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:23,399
RYAN: How do you feel about lobotomies?

2751
02:30:23,819 --> 02:30:26,739
AMY: The cat was my friend. I can't in good conscience--

2752
02:30:26,739 --> 02:30:28,479
KATE: You can't be friends with every animal. KRIS: That cat is anybody's friend.

2753
02:30:28,479 --> 02:30:29,899
RYAN: Here's the thing... KRIS: That cat is anybody's friend.

2754
02:30:29,899 --> 02:30:34,399
RYAN: There's a thing called the Food Chain? This cat aint going to buddy up with these mice.

2755
02:30:34,399 --> 02:30:36,520
KATE: I like that Walnut's like, "I can't be friends with every animal?"

2756
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:38,000
KRIS: I know it's tough. JERRY: Let's see the persuade roll.

2757
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:39,680
AMY: Okay. That's you.

2758
02:30:40,079 --> 02:30:42,239
RYAN: I need to persuade you! AMY: Right?

2759
02:30:42,239 --> 02:30:46,379
RYAN: To be okay with lying to these mice. AMY: I'll do it but...

2760
02:30:46,379 --> 02:30:48,039
KRIS: This is tense guys! &gt;&gt; JERRY: Go ahead. AMY: I will make sure that they get help.

2761
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:49,860
RYAN: What do I roll a 20? KRIS: Roll that die!

2762
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:51,659
KATE: We'll help them later. RYAN: Natural 20. &gt;&gt; AMY: 20!

2763
02:30:51,659 --> 02:30:52,379
JERRY: Natural 20. KATE: Holy cow!

2764
02:30:52,379 --> 02:31:00,879
JERRY: You, out of nowhere, you spin an incredible tale of mysticism, magic.

2765
02:31:00,879 --> 02:31:11,559
You are ready to deliver maximum loyalty. And it is so potent, in fact, that they bow...

2766
02:31:11,559 --> 02:31:12,894
RYAN: Ooh. Nice!

2767
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:14,559
JERRY: to the party.

2768
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:17,200
AMY: Now I'm uncomfortable.

2769
02:31:17,659 --> 02:31:21,819
JERRY: They'll allow you to mount the mice. They rise up...

2770
02:31:21,819 --> 02:31:22,619
KATE: Yes!

2771
02:31:22,844 --> 02:31:27,599
JERRY: and then begin running toward the end of the Homeward Star.

2772
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:28,159
KATE: Yes. RYAN: Nice.

2773
02:31:28,159 --> 02:31:29,539
JERRY: We're going to pick it up next week.

2774
02:31:29,540 --> 02:31:30,600
RYAN: Yay!  KATE: Yes.

2775
02:31:30,600 --> 02:31:31,600
JERRY: Thanks for playing everybody!

2776
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:33,180
RYAN: Watership down! KATE: Mouse mounts!

2777
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:34,460
KRIS: My god. RYAN: Nice.

2778
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:40,680
