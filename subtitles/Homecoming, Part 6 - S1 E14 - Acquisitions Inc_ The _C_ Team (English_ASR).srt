1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
turn it the enemy the pastor threatens

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,450
the fastest weapon you wouldn't make it

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,068
past a second land the question play a

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,039
flash and records to choose a course

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,750
solution you saw was proven in any

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,629
Sepulchre poll curtain will become a

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,368
putrid it's that well said I pursue in

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,679
no mountain too steep but don't

9
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,719
attendees to send expendable marks up to

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,910
the top of the peak of beneath this EUV

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,589
become like sharks to it while I swim in

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,689
that line again like Carl Barks through

13
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,609

not that if you look he left last he

64
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:57,669
emits a presence no like Christmas oh it

65
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:02,080
is cloud listen it's like this when last

66
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:05,199
we saw our heroes they had taken a task

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,440
they had agreed to be at least

68
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:13,829
temporarily the servants of an elder

69
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:20,289
Brian deep below the haunted ass city of

70
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:24,040
nemesis now the process of Nemesis

71
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:26,969
creation it churned up massive chunks of

72
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:31,109
the Underdark we're creatures like this

73
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:37,020
hold sway and it was deeply deeply

74
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:39,670
inconvenienced by a matrix of evil roots

75
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,930
that has actually projected and pierced

76
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:46,899
through the meat of the elder brain

77
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,120
making it somewhat unlike the creature

78
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,370
that is described on the on the

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
character sheet in the monster man if

80
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,390
you look it up these are really really

81
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,609
bad generally speaking you don't get to

82
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,379
see a creature like this when you're

83
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,690
fourthly I looked up elder Brian and I

84
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:07,449
didn't find any no no no initiates a

85
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:12,550
moment spotted yeah but having managed

86
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:16,798
the first of three routes managing a an

87
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:19,780
iron golem with the use of clever

88
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:24,279
prestidigitation glowing

89
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:27,129
genitals is that a variety of approaches

90
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:30,399
that were able to deliver success you

91
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:35,040
backed that up with some revelatory

92
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:37,989
meetings with a Minotaur servant of

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,730
walnut Don grasses order the enclave

94
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,470
panax anima or EPA do an effort deviate

95
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,189
bother to ask him his name

96
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:52,150
I can tell it to you later I screamed it

97
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:54,009
as it died it's a woman is dead yeah I

98
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,259
can hook it up but no no aspirin no I

99
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:57,730
guess I have somebody on Twitter like

100
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,129
does ever find out his name and of

101
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,720
course that person I told them but is

102
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,029
that is that again dig through your

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,460
montage okay yeah okay right now yeah

104
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:10,029
see in 20 Maris yeah you can feel

105
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:14,079
confident that I have named important

106
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:15,879
characters in this scenario no having

107
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,819
gone back down to the elder brains

108
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:22,659
chamber and then gone back up another

109
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:25,569
magical Mouse staircase into the third

110
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,090
of three chambers you entered what

111
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:31,329
appeared to be a my candid commune of

112
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:33,449
some kind you can see them just standing

113
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:36,069
up to their knees and raw sewage

114
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:42,370
apparently for them that's the you know

115
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:46,680
equivalent of a buffet my kanuda various

116
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:49,990
sizes indeed friendly young Mike ended

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,269
offering up gifts to dinar blitz in my

118
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,280
head for the people at home is a fancy

119
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,689
word for mushroom person right yeah yeah

120
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,478
I think you know there are these jelly

121
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,469
candies hey it's a movie food a red

122
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,379
green and yellow

123
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,530
indie truman they're the greatest I hate

124
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:07,240
the idiot Heath listen we're you know

125
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:10,149
again later we're never going to settle

126
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,740
this we could use the rest of the time

127
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:13,839
of the show and we would never get to

128
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,288
the bottom of this one there because

129
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,909
every an opportunity during tables back

130
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:24,490
but it is it so indeed they offer you up

131
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:30,660
a wide-brimmed mushroom friend slash hat

132
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:33,720
so imagine a imagine a abroad

133
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,189
round hat and the traditional you know

134
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,950
traditionally made of wood descendants

135
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:40,649
made out of a mushroom person and there

136
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:45,149
are in fact eyes on top of it that when

137
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:46,549
not asleep have opinions about things

138
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:50,370
that they express with the eyes

139
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:54,530
something to consider when lashes are

140
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,530
heroes they had entered a final chamber

141
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:01,500
composite you know I would say the good

142
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,990
70% of this chamber is something you

143
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,149
would call an eye of various kind

144
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,500
surrounded by them all focusing on the

145
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:15,870
party as they enter and indeed the

146
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:18,990
massive bulk of the fungus in here

147
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,180
constitutes a single organism that has

148
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,509
in fact grown up and around the entire

149
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:28,379
chamber and then around what you assume

150
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:30,990
may be root of some time historically

151
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,810
there have been roots in the chambers

152
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,370
that the elder brain has sent you to no

153
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:40,439
reason to believe this is not also a

154
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:42,209
root great um so does anyone have any

155
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,959
ideas I look back and I look at the

156
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:48,930
group and I noticed denars hat maybe

157
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,549
just like don't say anything about if I

158
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,269
said does anyone have any ideas about

159
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,350
how to get to what's probably the root

160
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:59,310
maybe without murdering the whole

161
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,710
mushroom family I have the question why

162
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,170
do we care we've been sat on this task I

163
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:06,719
mean I like them I like mushrooms as

164
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,530
much as the next guy but it's there our

165
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,210
way and we can just mold down and end

166
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:17,489
this used to say we're doing a bad thing

167
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:20,279
they don't like me a people this is

168
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,400
something that I think you will not

169
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,500
would agree risk potentially which is

170
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,349
that destroying the style roots

171
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:32,788
freeing this elder Brian and destroying

172
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:35,490
mensier is kind of a big deal these

173
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:37,590
mushroom people we can maybe they can

174
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,389
help us destroy the roots from how if

175
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,259
they're who knows if any of us can

176
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,029
figure out a way to communicate with

177
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,468
them maybe there's a way that they can

178
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,039
help us but I think that destroying the

179
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,680
root is

180
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,079
more important than saving their life I

181
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,149
agree and maybe they want that juice

182
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,090
inside maybe they can't get in there

183
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,459
because there it's just those soft you

184
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,250
know little Muslim slippers these

185
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,460
people's fault that the Underdark got

186
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,990
you know that the underdog was brought

187
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,150
to this town

188
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,320

it takes it well I mean the way I that

198
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,779
wrist looks at it is that we would have

199
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,210

that they are what's holding the city up

205
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:52,819
then we would have cut up whether or not

206
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:56,639
we knew it was a brain it's true uh I am

207
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:01,200

room appears to be there's the the

242
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:54,470
ceiling of it is the sky I can see some

of these these constellations yeah it is

244
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:01,649
quite all but by any sense that you can

245
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:08,389
leverage you are in a place a round

246
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:11,519

top of that root structure that central

250
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:27,200
column just a dome of the sky and it's

251
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,720
an incredible comfort to you also to be

252
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:35,270
so close to the forest even in this

253
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:40,790
haunted subterranean place the canopy

254
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:43,439
the inviting safety of the tree canopy

255
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:47,189
over the top of this room is definitely

256
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,760
putting you at ease and likewise okay

257
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:53,670
you can see the stone towers of the

258
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:59,730
monastery reaching off in the distance

259
00:12:53,669 --> 00:13:03,958
you can see them rising up and you know

260
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,820
that with only 10 minutes walk you would

261
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,679
be back in a place of safety where you

262
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,490
knew

263
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:14,688

see a gigantic dinar Blitzen ah looking

266
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:27,469
down the way that the way that a person

267
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:30,619
might look at a box of chocolates just

268
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:35,178
like reaching out toward distress and

269
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:37,449
then nonono reaching out toward this

270
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:40,639
fantasies of eating yeah yeah yeah

271
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:43,099
beautiful work mrs. Hyman listen I know

272
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,740
what you want at a document you want to

273
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,990
tot access the insects there's one

274
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,089
aboard I'm delivering on a race don't

275
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,860
ever usually exclusive oh okay you can

276
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:55,519
put it all into one adventure how much

277
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,568
to ask that's not the end consent you

278
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:02,028
continue this I'm listening because um

279
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:04,088
it's a comfort to you even now if

280
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:07,428
initially you think that you might be

281
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:10,069
rising because there's ever an

282
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:12,919
ever-greater dome with more richness

283
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:19,248
than you can imagine just a boy a velvet

284
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:22,370
sheet strewn with diamonds expanding

285
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:23,870
around the top and I say you think that

286
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,639
you're rising because it's taking up

287
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:29,149
more of your field of vision the fact of

288
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:32,568
the matter is is that there was never a

289
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:35,688
room could the best of your ability to

290
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:39,469
assess it there was no room of any kind

291
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:45,068
and what's more is that all of that all

292
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:50,209
of the the terror and anxiety and fear

293
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:53,479
of your isolation and it is isolating to

294
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:58,208
be a single creature always at some

295
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,678
level divided from other creatures you

296
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:02,838
realize now that that was a nightmare

297
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:09,259
that that was a kind of Perpetual

298
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:11,959
nightmare a falsehood and and it just

299
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:15,579
falls away all of these things all of

300
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:19,128
this all of this tension and anger is

301
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:19,888
just melting away and in fact and you

302
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:28,170
are hurdle

303
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:31,889
now Oh through uncool space a little

304
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:36,958
little bass oblivion exactly your your

305
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:42,869
body is a friendship to the creatures

306
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:44,758
that live within and on the surface of

307
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:47,269
your body oh yeah

308
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:52,730
and behind you you have an awareness

309
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:59,970
that a bright trail a Rainbow Road of

310
00:15:52,730 --> 00:16:02,489
spores is just bursting out across space

311
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:06,139
and because it's bursting out across

312
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:08,879
space its bursting out across time I

313
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,318
want your body for lack of a better term

314
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,909

315
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:18,058

316
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:26,219

Potteries but even the name even the

319
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:35,248
name is is useful as a piece of trivia

320
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,568
but the thing that separates you from me

321
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:40,110
on cause is alive

322
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:43,349
oh no that's a fiction it's a fiction

323
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,239

and you into you always there's always a

325
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:51,629
sympathy there's always a sympathy for

326
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:57,599
those who just from an accident just

327
00:16:51,629 --> 00:17:00,539
from a tragedy of death by deeply into

328
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,329
their origin that they are separate and

329
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,578
that they aren't unified they are enjoy

330
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:09,720
for lack of a better turn on I found my

331
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:13,459
way back exactly and it's and it's it's

332
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:19,068
precious it's precious now in this place

333
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:24,259
you are always delighted to see others

334
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:27,000
who swim in this dark ocean oh as well

335
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:30,079
and it could be left

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,140
it could be right your orientation is

337
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,629
cylindrical it's irrelevant

338
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,950
it brings you a little joy just to know

339
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,730
that this is another thing you don't

340
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:45,740
have to worry about but near you near

341
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:51,490
your shape in space you can see one of

342
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:55,490
the tiny vessels that much similar

343
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,589
individuals use to navigate and swim in

344
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:02,120
the way that they can Oh through the

345
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:04,970
black ocean that is so tremendously full

346
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:07,729
of stars these are some good [ __ ]

347
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,589
mushrooms you can say well technically

348
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,339
these are lawful neutral mushrooms

349
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:15,589
you're like poetically describing this

350
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:19,279
like so can't wait some fanart

351
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:21,349
no hating it but you're you're aware of

352
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:25,819
it as you're aware of anything that

353
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:31,099
comes near you in absolute terms right

354
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:33,769
you can see it's like a imagine imagine

355
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:36,709
of a cap

356
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:40,639
imagine a my candid cap but turned

357
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:43,610
upside down and not full of joy right

358
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,850
and then imagine another smaller thin

359
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:52,000
cap attached to it in some way that

360
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:55,399
enables it to move through the ocean

361
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,740
there are you know if you know for a

362
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,050
fact it takes you a second but you know

363
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:05,509
that the creatures that are in this cap

364
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:08,359
are called halflings and you can see a

365
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:09,890
family the small family now you know

366
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,629
that you know that they can feel a

367
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,450
section there's always going to be some

368
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,250
division between them but you know that

369
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,940
you know that they have a family like

370
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:23,059
the family that you have - not eternal

371
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,890
right it's not perfect it is enjoy but

372
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,659
it's something close it's good enough

373
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:33,290
for that we do you have to respect it

374
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:35,110
right man you can see a a mother and a

375
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:38,599
father these are their terms not

376
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:40,000
relevant to my candid I respect them

377
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,369
right

378
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,160
you can see them in there and you can

379
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:50,259
see a small one what is called a girl

380
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,950
just full of wonder something

381
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:56,859
approximating Mike and enjoy her tiny

382
00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:02,380
hands at the edge of the boat just

383
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:04,869
absorbing it's you it has to be you it

384
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,610
has to be the sight of youth that is

385
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:14,919
creating this pleasure

386
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:18,789
yes it's me I'm the condom how we can't

387
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,710
know she can't know there must be a way

388
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:22,690
that she's perceiving me even through

389
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,730
this that I don't understand that's

390
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,090
right I'm not behind I meant understand

391
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:30,759
that's right now she can't it would take

392
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:33,519
time for her to melt and they seem to be

393
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,470
going somewhere else but you'd like to

394
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,259
think that you might be able to

395
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,539
understand that joy at some point if

396
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:41,730
there were another opportunity it may be

397
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:45,250
a thousand years hence

398
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,990
but this consciousness will endure right

399
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:52,299
as they do yeah

400
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:55,450
now it could be an hour it could be a

401
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:57,509
week it's not relevant it could be a

402
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:02,410
year

403
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:06,640
before this joy fades and you are forced

404
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:11,050
to contend with this endless nature of

405
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,640
this ocean and you receive comfort from

406
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:15,009
the other creatures within and without

407
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,570
your body and they give you the energy

408
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:22,829
that you need to progress and to

409
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:26,169
continue for example your eyes here

410
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:29,049
your eyes are aware and they show you

411
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:32,140
the mad dishes and majestic wonders out

412
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:36,279
in this place and they say here are you

413
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:38,250
here are we happy here are we happy but

414
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:40,629
maybe there is someone like us there

415
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:46,029
maybe maybe they are worried right now

416
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:52,370
we could comfort them right there there

417
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:55,099
are there are creatures inside the eye

418
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:59,119
and their domain is that of sadness but

419
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:59,990
they have taken this on voluntarily they

420
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,699
are the weepers

421
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:06,410
they are over here and if they may be

422
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,569
you don't have to wake them up and you

423
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,670
hope that you won't have to know but you

424
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:14,839
are afraid that you might and then that

425
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:18,529
pang of fear is again blanketed by love

426
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:21,740
and joy from all the way out into your

427
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:25,539
extremities added to your massive form

428
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:29,450
that is the home of all these creatures

429
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:31,069
right I'm the best no it's true it is

430
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,960
absolutely true indeed it's always been

431
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:36,619
true you can remember the small creature

432
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,970
that you were but it's Justin now and

433
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:41,649
irrelevant and potentially untrue

434
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:46,850
something to consider

435
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:48,740
okay there are entities you need to get

436
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:52,789
ready because I'm not even done there

437
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:55,490
are entities in this place then you can

438
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:59,319
you can conceptualize it you can

439
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:02,390
conceptualize the arcs of their movement

440
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:07,000
there interdictor II like they it is

441
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:09,880
their intention to become close to you

442
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,470
and you are not a hundred percent

443
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,120
familiar with this shape this is a shape

444
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:19,370
you are not aware of you've seen

445
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:21,709
something like it a spider but spiders

446
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:24,949
don't swim the black ocean and they're

447
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:28,340
not massive they're not gigantic and

448
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:31,730
they're not made of metal and so this

449
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:36,439
distinguishes these spiders from another

450
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:38,900
type of spider is there any awareness or

451
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,380
any joy that you would like to

452
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,730
contribute

453
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:48,940
oh my god what a loaded question have

454
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:51,170
[ __ ] any sorry any awareness or any joy

all in the mushroom board right now we

457
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:57,379

458
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:59,269
things from what he is seeing yeah are

459
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,800

00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:24,109
and what what purpose or function do I

468
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:27,888
sense that there are other parts of my

469
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:30,589
body The Weavers the weepers yes both of

470
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:34,308
them Reapers their very existence is

471
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:37,609
such that much of the suffering that

472
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:39,950
would be sustained by the rest of you

473
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:43,519
it's concentrated in the weepers they

474
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,889

478
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,758
nature in the bath their the

479
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:08,299
technological advancement of them their

480
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:11,269
their pure black blackness and black

481
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:13,908
ocean I find them

482
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:16,940
terrifying but beautiful and that that

483
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:18,559
brings me joy I find joy and not

484
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,370
understanding them and knowing that

485
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,378
there is there is something there's

486
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:26,928
something that I had I get to strive for

487
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:30,230
there's more to know correct yeah in

488
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:32,798
this in this being of knowing and

489
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,179
feeling like we are all things and and

490
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,589
individualism doesn't matter to not know

491
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:40,850
something is so rare

492
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:46,609
I'll have that mystery exciting is it it

493
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:48,798
brings me joy we are joined now these

494
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:54,859
creatures and you you know that this is

495
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:56,259
true merely being isolated from one

496
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:59,990
another

497
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:05,000
creates so much pain that there are

498
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:08,480
those that act in a way that does not

499
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,119
create joy they can't help it there's no

500
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,670
reason there's no reason to dwell on it

501
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:19,929
but being separate is such a

502
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:26,140
to some creatures that they hurt each

503
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:28,029
other they hurt themselves and you think

504
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:32,560
that that might be their intention

505
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:37,420
they're getting incredibly close to your

506
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:42,730
flanks right now they're long the long

507
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:44,890
steel spindles of the four legs sort of

508
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:48,700
not not swarming there's only four of

509
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:52,780
them but you can see them approaching

510
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:58,500
with these sharp tips the sides now pain

511
00:26:52,779 --> 00:27:00,970
is not a concern but there is a sadness

512
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:06,730
associated with that breakage of the

513
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:08,700
body but not pain not I never pain they

514
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:13,390
are they are getting incredibly nearest

515
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,900
can can any of this joy be imparted to

516
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,850
them

517
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,700
have they been separate for too long

518
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:22,480
consider it consider it how am ia bring

519
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,610
that joy what my vessel is all

520
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,289
encompassing what what case do I have

521
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:31,809
I'm not like them I am connected to

522
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:35,529
everything and yet I am not connected to

523
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:36,099
them there is a sparkling path something

524
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,769
to consider

525
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:42,069
they trails behind me and eight it is

526
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:46,720
something I leave it is ours something

527
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:48,419
we leave is there a way that the weepers

528
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,740
might there you go

529
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:58,779
be able to contain the their desire to

530
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:01,269
hurt yes and if they can consume the

531
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:04,149
desire to hurt can we impart the joy yes

532
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:10,119
it must be you may have to explain it to

533
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:15,180
them okay where they dwell inside the

534
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:18,369
eye is a dark place you may have to

535
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,330
confer upon them some comfort to ready

536
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:24,849
them for this task

537
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:27,220
okay can we promise them that we will

538
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:28,839
take away the suffering and replace it

539
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,870
take away the dark

540
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,189
that they've lived their lives in and as

541
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:34,778
replace it with joy and make sure that

542
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,019
they know that they're not going to be a

543
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:40,329
part anymore I think so I hope so okay I

544
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:43,960
don't even know that we need to promise

545
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:46,449
it to promise means that it could

546
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,778
possibly be in our nature not to do so

547
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,028
sure it is our nature it's just a

548
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:54,038
declaration to fulfill this right not

549
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:56,079
wrong where's the knowledge it's just we

550
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:56,710

551
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,359
we will do

552
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:05,308

come from them being a part than

559
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:29,350

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:13,960
identify and then send the weeper and

573
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:16,539

leave okay Weaver's you are you sent

584
00:30:53,829 --> 00:31:04,569
forth from the I it is your purpose to

585
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:08,609
bring unity to those who do not have and

586
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:13,179
as you are launched out from the home

587
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:15,549
you can see that there are even more of

588
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:18,940
these creatures even more of these steel

589
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:21,579
spiders and not for no not for there are

590
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:27,519
more they have some way of hiding in the

591
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:29,949
Black Sea but the I it's entirely

592
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,200
possible that the I was overwhelmed by

593
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,860
the isolation

594
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,740
since you have you are not being sent

595
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:41,219
directly to one of the spiders you are a

596
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:49,409
little bit off you're going to need to

597
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:52,200
use your own ability to attach my bag in

598
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:54,299
this context there isn't anything all UI

599
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,509

body and sail down there is an open deck

625
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:16,048
like that of a seagoing vessel on the

626
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:21,538
top that is sort of set down in the guts

627
00:33:16,048 --> 00:33:26,819
of this steel arachnid and you can see

00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:31,109
that this deck is rising risk the

629
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:34,138

out as a as a weeper your body is

649
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:34,690
designed to bring harmony every facet of

650
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:38,570
it is designed the same spores that

651
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:42,860
exist in the trail is it in your own

652
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:47,360
body and you can convey confer harmony

653
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:52,130
on others as a direct result but as you

654
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:55,400
as you attempt to embrace one of these

655
00:34:52,130 --> 00:35:00,349
creatures imagine imagine a high abdomen

656
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:02,809
the spider ship itself and the creatures

657
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:05,659
that dwell on it they have made this

658
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,639
ship in their own image you can see that

659
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:13,029
they themselves have four legs it's

660
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:18,469
almost like a like a hairy massive brown

661
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:22,100
spider with a head that comes up almost

662
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:25,250
like a serpent and then looked down it

663
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:26,989
has a mouth full of sharp teeth as I

664
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,289
said you used to endeavor to embrace

665
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:32,859
them sure and I want to and it does not

666
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:36,409
and you are not able to incorporate it

667
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:40,550
again I'm if they accept they descend on

668
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:43,940
you wonderful on the deck

669
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:49,760
this is it's horrifying sure I guess you

670
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:52,630
can hear is that they are commanding

671
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,960
each other they are

672
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,920
precisely what to do at every moment

673
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,960
they're telling each other they are

674
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,000
telling each other what to do and you

675
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:09,079
you suspect them that horror that that's

676
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,539
separation the need to gesticulate the

677
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,369
flap and to do all these things simply

678
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:14,809
to be understood right and then there

679
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,949
are those who are telling others to do

680
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:17,960
things and they are not doing it

681
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:20,599
themselves and they have no awareness of

682
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,990
it they never do they never do

683
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,519
it's in conceded universe that you've

684
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:30,099
been exposed to on the deck of this

685
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:34,039
craft is inconceivable the they have a a

686
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:37,610
blade a weapon that looks like a

687
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:40,789
crescent and a half circle attached to a

688
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:43,820
steel rod and as they sleep as if they

689
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:48,139
sweep them down on you it's not pain

690
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:50,570
sure it's sadness just the breakage of

691
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:54,739
the body has a sadness because you can

692
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:57,080
no longer be of use right and something

693
00:36:54,739 --> 00:37:00,969
to do to get points seven days you take

694
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:05,900
a point to seven yeah you are struck

695
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:11,839
repeatedly one of them in their fury and

696
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:15,500
isolation and rage clamps down bite on

697
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:18,110
the firm on the armored cap that the

698
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:21,920
home has provided you to protect it and

699
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:27,289
in that moment it draws its head away

700
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:31,550
and you know what it knows and it knows

701
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:40,279
what you know and it's stunning it is a

702
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:46,820
stunning process of they purchase each

703
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:51,140
other they attack ships and feel

704
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:53,330
individuals and buy and sell them and

705
00:37:51,139 --> 00:38:01,119

this is this is just this is as simple

721
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:15,068
as standing up or walking across the

722
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:20,159
room so so you begin to turn the massive

723
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:24,268
bulk of the home and flood this space

724
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:28,239
with the spores and almost instantly you

725
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:31,808
are flooded with the realizations that I

726
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:36,239
communicated to the weeper they they are

727
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:42,400
denizens of a of an ill of a sick

728
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:44,139
society and its torment its torment it

729
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,139
explains everything about their behavior

730
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:51,150
and then as you are aware of this you

731
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:54,489
feel intense sadness not from this side

732
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:59,559
but from the top and you can you're

733
00:39:54,489 --> 00:40:06,099
aware that at at least two places long

734
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:09,640
steel legs have begun to penetrate the

735
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:13,749
outer skin and they have begin to scroll

736
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:16,608
along the surface toward each other

737
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:20,858
they're crawling around the outer edge

738
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:24,980
of the body one of my one of my denizens

739
00:40:20,858 --> 00:40:28,778
they are but they are not weepers they

740
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:32,210
are not as a rule

741
00:40:28,778 --> 00:40:36,170
oriented toward this purpose you are

742
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:37,818
welcome to communicate with them and try

743
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,608
to make sure that they understand what's

744
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:49,880
happening how you phrase it is important

745
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:59,318
I turn inward it turns inward we turn

746
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:59,318
way turn inward yes and express that we

747
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:07,369
how fortunate we are to not have to

748
00:41:04,748 --> 00:41:11,659
contend with the idea of being separate

749
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:17,989
if we do not understand the construct of

750
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:25,248
separateness then disregard and continue

751
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:27,889
but if you do if we do know that there

752
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,578
were there was so much value in this

753
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:32,018
cohesion

754
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:32,019
however finite

755
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:48,400
USC's of the century yes and they

756
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:53,460
understand ice what can what can we do

757
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:56,710
we eyes but anything that you see

758
00:41:53,460 --> 00:42:00,699
weepers can be applied to okay so there

759
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:04,630
are there are these spiders these ships

760
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:07,538
have begun to crawl and chew they're

761
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:10,510
operating around the mid-session okay

762
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:13,359
vapors can be tasks do I have an

763
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:16,359
infinite supply of weavers beyond

764
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:20,259
counting wonderful so I will send can I

765
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:24,308
send one weeper out of two of our eyes

766
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:28,410
wanted each of these these spiders ever

767
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:33,039
walk again with the purpose that we are

768
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:35,379
attempting to attempting to is the wrong

769
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:39,250
word with the with the purpose that we

770
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:42,010
will become one with these organisms and

771
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:46,298
take away their deep sadness and their

772
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:52,960
sickness yes okay that's a 20 for the

773
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:56,250
first shooting and 18th absolutely there

774
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,630
is a creature you are aware of it dimly

775
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:01,239
but now you've been given full awareness

776
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:05,910
of it because you have been tasked by

777
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:08,919
the eye and you are sent from an eye

778
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:12,278
almost in an elliptical orbit fired out

779
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,329
and then drawn back to the surface you

780
00:43:12,278 --> 00:43:18,730
are you land on the deck of a ship

781
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:21,940
shaped like this spider creature is

782
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:23,409
crawling along the surface and you have

783
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,358
an awareness that there is another one

784
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:31,288
just like on the other side and they are

785
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:31,288
slowly working to carve the ship in half

786
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:39,568
I'll go to the closest one and sin eat

787
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:47,199
it bring them on board yeah absolutely

788
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:51,108
just roll for it mm-hmm tennis something

789
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:55,669
absolutely uh from correctly from your

790
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:59,509
hands waves of spores shimmering golden

791
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:02,869
shimmering spores explode out onto the

792
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,470
deck miss cloud yeah a mist cloud if you

793
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:06,349
will

794
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:07,848
oh this is the mists cloud that's what

795
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:10,970
we're talking about yes exactly

796
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:15,400
the spider continues to crawl but those

797
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:19,368
who are here on the deck in instant

798
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:22,608
cease their travails they invade they

799
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:26,960
come close to you because they long to

800
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:29,269
be close physically as well but this is

801
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:34,159
not where the spider receives its

802
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:37,250
commands this their ships have have

803
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:39,469
creatures at them and they manually

804
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:43,130
direct them like them like they're

805
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:45,288

room is full of physically much larger

811
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:10,179
specimens of the same the same creature

812
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:14,769
you flood this room with golden spores

813
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:18,858
and immediately immediately they pull

814
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:24,528
back on these levers the slider just

815
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:27,528
detaches floats away you join them in

816
00:45:24,528 --> 00:45:33,219

time what is what is the aspect of this

826
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,940
day enjoying this linguistic challenged

827
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,710

okay Joe I'm gonna buy directional

831
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:40,349
microphone and go here here what is the

832
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:45,029
aspect of this this entity who is making

833
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:49,349
us experience sadness no in relation to

834
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:52,110
me in relation to us where is it there

835
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:53,730
is one is you would say it's on the

836
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,640
another creature we call this their

837
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:59,670
belly good creature that isn't this is

838
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:05,789
you know rotary as you are it is a

839
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:09,809
uniform see but the cuts the sadness is

840
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:12,809
deep this is a this is a ship that is

841
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:18,529
purpose-built for this type of war and

842
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:23,009
you have a you have a you have a sense

843
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:30,060
that some of you are being taken into

844
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:32,790
these ships then of course it didn't

845
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:36,509
occur to us earlier because of how

846
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:38,670
foreign it is its but it is absolutely

847
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:45,400
it is it is beyond comprehension to

848
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:49,260
exist in that way we must we want

849
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:55,450
this makes any sense we must move away

850
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:59,920
relative separate from or we have no

851
00:47:55,449 --> 00:48:03,159
concept of that if we have some concept

852
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,780
it's a philosophical quandary so you say

853
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:09,069
you until you would like to move your

854
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:15,730
body in such a way that our creates

855
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:17,170
distance of yes I want a Jamiroquai it

856
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:23,590
must want to travel without moving

857
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:26,079
they must have - that would be at 12 if

858
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:29,950
we're using the same either way this

859
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:33,150
course object yes the file with this

860
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:35,949
enumeration this is the only number

861
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:42,039
unnecessary all this Jarvis know what

862
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:46,889
ice cream - yarn thanks only joy do it

863
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:54,190
this one grows art you you turn the body

864
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:59,289
card you can see against the against the

865
00:48:54,190 --> 00:49:03,130
sea there is a bright shape a green and

866
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:05,079
blue shape as you are turning it some

867
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:08,349
portion of your awareness is given over

868
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:14,380
to a curiosity about it but the act of

869
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:20,730
turning has flexed this cut this savage

870
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:25,570
cut in the side and the front splits

871
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:30,579
from the back and the back falls away

872
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:35,320
and it is yourself and you are aware of

873
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:39,090
it and it is aware of it and there is a

874
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:43,960
moment where you are still connected and

875
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:48,970
joyous and then it is gone falls back

876
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:53,980
this is the capacity that you have to

877
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:55,829
guide your body through space and it is

878
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,019
gone

879
00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:06,239
and you are drawn as though by a a wimp

880
00:50:00,019 --> 00:50:10,019
cold toward this orb and the heat is

881
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:13,709
incredible as you near it and as you

882
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:15,659
push through its sky that a long time

883
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:19,440
since you've seen the sky but you know

884
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:24,329
you know what it is and you can see that

885
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:28,349
there is a crack in this place a deep

886
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:32,009
crack and you know that that can be a

887
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:36,029
home too that can be another type of

888
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:38,850
home too near the sky is no good that is

889
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:43,620
not a joyous place but a deep place a

890
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:48,230
cool place this can be a home you wake

891
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:52,500
up and there is a moment of Terror as

892
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:55,800
you are in sold in your body's rosy

893
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:58,980
beasting orchestra Strauss walnut dawn

894
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:02,460
grass and dinar blitz and pulled away

895
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,090
from a full unity a full understanding

896
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:08,030
of each other

897
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:12,510
and deposited in this fragmentary

898
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:14,490
nightmare but you you become accustomed

899
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:16,650
to it you can remember that you used to

900
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:22,759
do this all the time this was considered

901
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:25,710
normal just look at everybody else yeah

902
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:29,070
so this is a cavern there's no sky above

903
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:32,070
there's no canopy there's no dinar

904
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:35,010
Blitzen snacking or planning to snack

905
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:39,690
thank goodness there's no cool

906
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:50,670
there is no cool stone tower of safety

907
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:55,409
and refuge as a as a once upon a time

908
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:59,099
experiment or would such compounds yeah

909
00:51:55,409 --> 00:52:02,009
psilocybin yeah we're aware of exactly

910
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:04,559
what has happened my my suspicion is

911
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:08,460
that the alchemy skill that you do have

912
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,048
the Arcana skill is probably like 30%

913
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,789
eating things you should

914
00:52:10,048 --> 00:52:15,268
that's just my guess well that's how you

915
00:52:11,789 --> 00:52:18,410
build it yeah it's like I came but like

916
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:18,409
for your consciousness yeah

917
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:23,939
everybody else is conscious yeah yeah

918
00:52:21,478 --> 00:52:27,478
you're looking around and it's like if

919
00:52:23,938 --> 00:52:32,578
if at any moment you hesitate you can

920
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:35,248
see a friendly my candid provider a

921
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:37,559
support structure to help you stand nice

922
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:43,018
look down I'm gonna go I told you guys I

923
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:45,930
didn't want to kill how much of this do

924
00:52:43,018 --> 00:52:47,308
we remember to the fader up all of it

925
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:50,098
you remember you remember it as though

926
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:54,028
it was real and it was real it's all

927
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:56,338
real I'm crying and Rosie's probably

928
00:52:54,028 --> 00:52:58,318
extremely moved too because I think that

929
00:52:56,338 --> 00:53:01,608
there were things that she saw that she

930
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:05,719
recognized in that yeah absolutely

931
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:09,438
absolutely I think things that you know

932
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:13,559
intimately right

933
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:20,159
okay so let's kill the mushroom people

934
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:23,039
yeah yeah exactly you can see that on

935
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:25,858
the center of this in the center of this

936
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:28,439
column obviously you're surrounded by

937
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:31,130
eyes and the rest of these are the sorts

938
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:35,159
of mushrooms as I said last game that

939
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:37,890
exists on a tree like when a mushroom

940
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:39,719
has to find a home on a [ __ ] those

941
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:44,098
platforms cylinder if I did exactly

942
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:46,979
right strong firm mushrooms that are

943
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:49,048
sort of around in a sort of stair step

944
00:53:46,978 --> 00:53:52,169
circular stair type pattern around the

945
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:56,509
middle until now you did not know that

946
00:53:52,170 --> 00:54:01,229
some of them were mouths as well

947
00:53:56,509 --> 00:54:06,688
twelve mouths fifteen mouths around this

948
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:11,518
central column speak and they say this

949
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:15,438
place is too near the sky for us this is

950
00:54:11,518 --> 00:54:21,118
not what we are meant to be it is no

951
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:23,219
harm to us to destroy this route but we

952
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,970
have sent an envoy with you

953
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:33,959
if you are ever in the deep places of

954
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:40,739
this world we will be again what they

955
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:45,269
mean no should rattle one of them

956
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:49,098
climbing your bag because we know what

957
00:54:45,269 --> 00:54:53,460
you know and you know what we know and

958
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:57,990
knowing that we cannot allow this city

959
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:59,480
to remain finally someone is talking

960
00:54:57,989 --> 00:55:07,469
sense

961
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:09,869
um yeah I feel like flaws like like you

962
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:11,489
know puts it like past the midline

963
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:13,588
knowing that they're all you know we're

964
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:15,719
all it's all one yeah no you know that

965
00:55:13,588 --> 00:55:18,568
resistance acetyl and this räikkönen

966
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:22,679
society yeah put the hand on one and

967
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:26,699
says uh I do know that this is this is

968
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:29,669
too near near this guy um and so I said

969
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:33,809
like we will we will destroy other route

970
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:35,460
that's that's what we do and so we're

971
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:38,369
about that's what we're about and I and

972
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:42,119
then I'll just say like and you go

973
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:45,869
continue spreading the with the

974
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:50,088
questions joy that you do in the way

975
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:52,410
that you do so well so what you do you

976
00:55:50,088 --> 00:55:55,559
could they say that they can destroy the

977
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:57,719
truth it's already destroyed oh good I

978
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,219
was very nervous this happens I miss it

979
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:01,289
gosh well they'll take credit for

980
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:03,739
destroying - yeah as is our destiny and

981
00:56:01,289 --> 00:56:06,719
we we will try to find a deeper place

982
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:09,179
perhaps as soon as you can find some day

983
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,919
yeah when we find a deep this place we

984
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:14,460
will bring you to that place I have a

985
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,630
sudden distaste for destruction feel

986
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,318
like I've been going about this the

987
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:19,318
wrong way

988
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:21,949
yeah maybe now we won't have to murder

989
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:23,909
her maybe they always turn our corner

990
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:24,419
this will give you this is going to be

991
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:26,068
the change

992
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,940
yeah so thought about Jefferson

993
00:56:26,068 --> 00:56:32,670

Valley well what was it all for them the

00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:54,059
mouths around the central column you can

1000

see that sort of cinched in is leveraged

1001
00:56:54,059 --> 00:57:02,519

blow up that is all I wanted all I

1008
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:24,660
wanted it but my victory condition for

1009
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:26,699
this game was to have one of you say we

1010
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:30,149
are joy without being prompted and I got

1011
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:31,529
that like 20 minutes ago so like I said

1012
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:33,450
does a dragon how do you see a lot of

1013
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,940
gold a lot of treasure

1014
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:38,369
why XP yeah it's just a lot of we serve

1015
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,260
as a table talk you know just a classic

1016
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:43,109
GD created a see if they're all the

1017
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,850
dressers goblins displays rubies some

1018
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:47,660
kind of drug trip yeah I'm sort of

1019
00:57:44,849 --> 00:57:50,819
interactive he is co-op drug trip

1020
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:52,889
exactly but I look at that next pretty

1021
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:55,740
well be like oh it was totally great so

1022
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:57,269
they had been voicing at this point and

1023
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:58,559
it's also some throwback I'll go into it

1024
00:57:57,269 --> 00:58:00,360
in the table talk but there's some

1025
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,299
throwback stuff for the old-school nerds

1026
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,610
in there and DM so I figured yeah which

1027
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,350
is your mind around it exactly what

1028
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,460
we're doing but but like this is the

1029
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:09,989
reason I was when I emphasize that this

1030
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,090
is D and D as opposed to whatever I was

1031
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:15,119
doing before was that you have the wheel

1032
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:17,160
again oh I do like you have to wait for

1033
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,500
me to lean into wheel or does enemy

1034
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:21,809
nerds like I like the audiobook so your

1035
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,150
penis you're playing know you need that

1036
00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:27,029
know great I do I'm not going that was

1037
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:28,740
like a telltale game yeah I go I'll hit

1038
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:30,560
X up no I mean keep doing your

1039
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:35,119
semi-fitted sovereign will remember that

1040
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:38,279
and they will oh my god I'm especially

1041
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,659
so I look around and I'm doing my best I

1042
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,000
feel like I have a question like is

1043
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:44,549
there like a lingering understanding of

1044
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,969
my like was that like like a team

1045
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:49,800
bonding thing do I have like a reluctant

1046
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:51,629
knowledge of them on any level yeah

1047
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,740
how granular there's not even your

1048
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,820
leptin like I said business what you

1049
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:57,719
wanted to know yeah

1050
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:01,650
no it's the thing that's fading is the

1051
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:05,129
connection between each other the memory

1052
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:06,869
of the of the harmonious whole that has

1053
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:08,130
remained with you all right but you'd

1054
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:10,500
but it's just it's like it's like when

1055
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:12,630
you wake up from a dream like the things

1056
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,639
that you knew about each other so

1057
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:19,349
there's looking in that place those are

1058
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:22,500
fading out fast just individual images

1059
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:24,659
in icons symbols and they're just

1060
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,449
they're slipping out if you guys take a

1061
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:31,259
look at me I'm I am feverishly writing

1062
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:33,029
where I can yeah and really I give up

1063
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,650
because it's I know it's garbage like

1064
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:36,269
you know you write something the middle

1065
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:38,460
of the night I'd like to sleep and it's

1066
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:39,210
just two words just trash it doesn't

1067
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,329
mean anything

1068
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:45,389
I'm so disappointed once diligently

1069
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:47,039
documenting this doctor

1070
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:48,329
that's that's your task it's just a

1071
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,670
really good picture of a mushroom and

1072
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:54,630
the thing I suppose you should go see

1073
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:56,070
how our elder friend is doing no even

1074
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:57,450
point of it all right now are you in

1075
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:59,700
here yes you can see if you can see the

1076
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:03,480
I'm still connected the cranium ragbag

1079
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:15,980
that sort of cylindrical spiral around

1080
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:18,929
that central core you just exploring it

1081
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:21,179
drink going up a half way going back

1082
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:24,019
down a little bit nervous mm-hmm goes up

happened

1088
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:34,800
oh yeah well whatever it is what these

1089
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,440
spores doesn't appear to stick to the

1090
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,269
mouse question yeah two questions one

1091
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,760
has everything still made out of stone

1092
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:44,670
here as I hear stone and metal and

1093
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,110
everything yeah for yeah I mean if

1094
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,490
construction hasn't been altered many in

1095
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:50,519
America well I'm just wondering like

1096
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:53,189
where the route was because it's right

1097
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:57,119
yeah the givings is the guess you can

1098
01:00:53,190 --> 01:01:01,639
make it an educated guess that that is

1099
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:04,009
to substrate upon which the sovereign

1100
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:07,038
actually grown in this room okay okay

1101
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:12,579
okay is elder Bryan wherever al freed

1102
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:16,309
everyone else we're gonna yeah yeah up

1103
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:21,010
hop-hop-hop leaves you back and you can

1104
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:21,010
see your majestic princess staircase

1105
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:30,858
sparkle back up into form and as you

1106
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:34,459
come down this the chamber is a hive of

1107
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:40,038
activity there were always sort of like

1108
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:44,510
in a fairy pods from this you know group

1109
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:47,390
going out and engaging exactly engaging

1110
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:50,359
engaging in unique tasks as they were

1111
01:01:47,389 --> 01:01:52,338
assigned and you can see that the entire

1112
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:57,489
group of them appears to be working

1113
01:01:52,338 --> 01:02:01,099
actively on the brain right now so the

1114
01:01:57,489 --> 01:02:03,139
it has been sort of held up almost like

1115
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:06,230
I said it's going to drawing rack almost

1116
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:08,538
stretched out distended like you assume

1117
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:11,568
that's not its normal thing that's not

1118
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:13,640
it's kink you know what I mean at this

1119
01:02:11,568 --> 01:02:17,778
at this time the the roots that have

1120
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:20,509
come down of withered so small that it

1121
01:02:17,778 --> 01:02:23,768
is actually sort of resting sort of

1122
01:02:20,509 --> 01:02:26,858
hanging a little bit off of it imagine

1123
01:02:23,768 --> 01:02:31,028
imagine like a wet shirt on a branch

1124
01:02:26,858 --> 01:02:34,038
it's just sort of hanging over these

1125
01:02:31,028 --> 01:02:37,039
roots that no longer have any sway or

1126
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:39,950
power and you can see that even inside

1127
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:44,390
these the holes that are dug through the

1128
01:02:39,949 --> 01:02:47,960
brain they're full of rats you can see

1129
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:51,230
rats sort of like crawling around in the

1130
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:55,130
interior structures cleaning and

1131
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:57,349
preparing the flesh or you tell them

1132
01:02:55,130 --> 01:03:01,608
exactly what to do a lot of guys love

1133
01:02:57,349 --> 01:03:03,740
this brain problem it has a lot of

1134
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:05,538
medicinal yeah exactly if the deer mouse

1135
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:10,608
are clearer than our mouse yeah where I

1136
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:15,230
read this yeah like it and then you can

1137
01:03:10,608 --> 01:03:18,559
see as it they're their work

1138
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:21,079
is just as dutiful instant that is

1139
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:23,679
crawling around the surface and then one

1140
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:30,380
by one you see each of these rats

1141
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:32,929
reduced into a liquid that collapses and

1142
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:37,309
runs out of these channels in the brain

1143
01:03:32,929 --> 01:03:40,969
and then slowly fills this pool beneath

1144
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:44,539
the brain and it sort of slides off like

1145
01:03:40,969 --> 01:03:47,868
imagine them on imagine Portobello like

1146
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:51,559
off of a like a like a grill spatula

1147
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:55,369
yeah just you hit on it eases down in a

1148
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:59,269
giant brain yes off of a giant piece of

1149
01:03:55,369 --> 01:04:03,470
wood yeah yeah basically into a brain

1150
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:05,690
pool a pool of liquefied rat that's

1151
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:10,189
right you're you're not a medium because

1152
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:17,900
except for pop hop-hop-hop does not join

1153
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:23,690
the chorus they said no I'm gonna tell

1154
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:26,450
you that yeah be the voice that you have

1155
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:31,760
heard before that you recognize from

1156
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:33,949
this creature is projected you know this

1157
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:40,340
as though there is an echo but it's no

1158
01:04:33,949 --> 01:04:45,139
physical voice shore it it says you have

1159
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:48,019
done as I have asked yeah and now I will

1160
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:55,868
do as I have promised hmm there is a

1161
01:04:48,019 --> 01:05:01,309
chamber beneath this city that is warded

1162
01:04:55,869 --> 01:05:08,350
with tremendous sophistication against

1163
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:11,840
scrying but my network is dutiful and

1164
01:05:08,349 --> 01:05:18,339
each of them has a tiny piece of my will

1165
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:21,829
which is greater than average let's say

1166
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:25,130
black writer trolley yeah you're great

1167
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:28,969

1168
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:33,920
just uh I can easily

1169
01:05:28,969 --> 01:05:39,709
make my way back to my domain and I

1170
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:43,070
shall return to me this dutiful servant

1171
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:50,179
of mine after he has shown you your

1172
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:56,750
reward and I pray we never meet each

1173
01:05:50,179 --> 01:06:00,289
other again that the incentives to work

1174
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:05,719
together may not hold in the realm I

1175
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:07,489
command all the contact do is trust me

1176
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:08,389

deeper chamber that's protected by magic

1185
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,750
against crying and there we will find

1186

you know what happened to the Homewood

1225
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:11,960
star there is a pause but that's not

1226
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:18,880
that doesn't characterize its

1227
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:18,880

01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,930
about using the stars from your clip

1232
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:50,119

regenerate yeah something refreshing but

1234
01:08:50,119 --> 01:09:04,939

1280
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:08,630
self-destruct button the reward is I

01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:12,170
don't have to oh my god mr. in just a

1282
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:15,069
magical um yes well it's like inching

1283
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:17,989
towards or like looking at pop-up like

1284
01:11:15,069 --> 01:11:18,590
can you you take out yeah he's a hopping

1285
01:11:17,989 --> 01:11:23,449
a couple times

1286
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:28,039
obstacle times in place and then leads

1287
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:30,019
you out in the opposite part of this in

1288
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:33,199
the office of part of his chamber which

1289
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:36,170
is a cracked and shattered version of

1290
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:39,079
you assume where it would dwell in its

1291
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:41,779
normal place it's just it has equity

1292
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:44,180
looks like a ruin of some kind but you

1293
01:11:41,779 --> 01:11:47,869
can guess what it must look like in the

1294
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:50,690
seat of his power and he walks directly

1295
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:53,059
through the back wall he works through

1296
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:54,829
the wall sure that's not the weirdest

1297
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:56,300
thing ever since there honestly yeah

1298
01:11:54,829 --> 01:11:59,899
that's like this literally the least

1299
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:02,210
weird thing yeah disappointment [ __ ] you

1300
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:03,949
really Wow I want to wake up to the wall

1301
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:05,480
all confident like I'm definitely going

1302
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:08,899
to go through it but then also just kind

1303
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:12,619
of be like yeah and then I try and go

1304
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:14,539
through it yeah it's warm it's warm

1305
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:16,029
imagine walking through a curtain of

1306
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:19,010
warm water

1307
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:21,889
I don't just and disturb your raiment

1308
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:27,110
you know but it definitely you can just

1309
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:29,329
get a cascade of warmth as you pass

1310
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:31,429
through this you all see her pass

1311
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:33,890
immediately through the wall the other

1312
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:38,180
it's not good I mean as a sconce it has

1313
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:40,220
like a torch yeah like I panic when I

1314
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:42,829
see you disappear Judith wall and I'm

1315
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:45,380
after you like a shot I've cooked in too

1316
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:48,019
long yes it's a phone that way through

1317
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:50,449
the peril of the map yeah yeah I got a

1318
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:54,830
contact a mod to get down did you see

1319
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:57,679
shadows deep shadows and you pass you

1320
01:12:54,829 --> 01:13:00,050
pass through this wall there are three

1321
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:04,060
more just like it

1322
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:05,889
each of them each of them completely

1323
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:08,139
indiscernible from

1324
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:09,279
a normal structure and you could but you

1325
01:13:08,139 --> 01:13:12,038
can recall that when you came down

1326
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:14,639
initially even to find the elder brains

1327
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:17,408
chamber at first yeah

1328
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:20,139
there were walls that you passed through

1329
01:13:17,408 --> 01:13:21,819
but these are but that was very fast I

1330
01:13:20,139 --> 01:13:23,769
was also like non-consensual like they

1331
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:25,599
just took us no you were going out of

1332
01:13:23,769 --> 01:13:28,208
the way right you were going to a place

1333
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:31,090
so you're passing through this is

1334
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:34,479
remembering something or it doesn't see

1335
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:38,380
it doesn't see illusions you know what I

1336
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:39,999
mean I receive real walls okay so we go

1337
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:42,609
through three of these and that like

1338
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:44,828
each time would like more speed and more

1339
01:13:42,609 --> 01:13:46,359
gusto yeah yeah just more enthusiasm

1340
01:13:44,828 --> 01:13:50,859
you're getting to the end of the book

1341
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:55,469
Yeah right married it does last twenty

1342
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:58,029
six fast act three you guys so you so

1343
01:13:55,469 --> 01:14:03,179
once you once you leave to the last one

1344
01:13:58,029 --> 01:14:03,179
it makes you wonder how much of that

1345
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:09,699
subterranean structure was real and how

1346
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:12,009
much of it was some kind of a projection

1347
01:14:09,698 --> 01:14:12,908
because this doesn't look like a this

1348
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:21,130
doesn't look anything like that

1349
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:24,398
architecture it is is how to put it this

1350
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:25,840
is very organic the rest of it and I

1351
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:28,119
mean like the organic I have least I

1352
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:32,349
mean this looks as though it was created

1353
01:14:28,118 --> 01:14:34,299
by natural forces right as opposed to

1354
01:14:32,349 --> 01:14:35,679
everything else which is you know it's

1355
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,998
likely you would build at a dwarven

1356
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,309
Forge or something right

1357
01:14:36,998 --> 01:14:40,719
I mean it's like the ceramics it's got

1358
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:44,679
all the little stuff is they go here at

1359
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:47,729
the fountain is an image or a dream of

1360
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:53,408
something that the brain knew perhaps

1361
01:14:47,729 --> 01:14:55,899
this feels like it was created by you

1362
01:14:53,408 --> 01:14:59,978
know dripping water over a substantial

1363
01:14:55,899 --> 01:15:03,159
period of time okay and then it is

1364
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:05,949
basically a tunnel and at the tear at

1365
01:15:03,158 --> 01:15:08,679
the very end of this tunnel is a bright

1366
01:15:05,948 --> 01:15:11,828
green light okay

1367
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:12,729
it's a fair distance and we were all

1368
01:15:11,828 --> 01:15:14,288
together

1369
01:15:12,729 --> 01:15:19,460
I assume I've walked through yeah yeah

1370
01:15:14,288 --> 01:15:23,029
yes go into it as you as you are pushing

1371
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:27,829
through it the closer you get to it the

1372
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:29,719
more intense the first of all the

1373
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:33,500
suspect the warm forest like a forest

1374
01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:37,880
and a high summer smell is coming out of

1375
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:42,250
this chamber and you can see roots vital

1376
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,250
roots and leaves yeah absolutely

1377
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,219
they shouldn't be able to survive down

1378
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:52,690
here this is not where they do their

1379
01:15:46,219 --> 01:15:57,369
thing and as you exit the tunnel and

1380
01:15:52,689 --> 01:16:01,969
emerge into the chamber there is a

1381
01:15:57,369 --> 01:16:05,539
single tree and it is lit by a shaft of

1382
01:16:01,969 --> 01:16:08,210
light coming from the ceiling up and to

1383
01:16:05,539 --> 01:16:10,039
the right almost like a it looks like it

1384
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:12,829
might be a great like a street grate or

1385
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:18,738
something like that and as that light

1386
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:23,029
comes down and strikes the tree beams of

1387
01:16:18,738 --> 01:16:27,289
it project from leaf to leaf until the

1388
01:16:23,029 --> 01:16:30,500
entire tree is illuminated like a

1389
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:34,909
crystal yeah yeah cuz it's very it's

1390
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:38,210
very thin waxy leaf but you can see that

1391
01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:40,639
the light is just shining from leaf to

1392
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:43,699
leaf they're just generous with each

1393
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,050
other around the entire thing so this is

1394
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:46,159
this is not a type of tree that you're

1395
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:46,430
familiar I don't know anything about

1396
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:50,539
that

1397
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:53,030
it comes down as the the trunk comes

1398
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:56,350
down but sends a roots reach around in

1399
01:16:53,029 --> 01:17:02,929
front and close around a pool of water

1400
01:16:56,350 --> 01:17:08,950
okay great okay and two strange fruits

1401
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:15,010
of this tree are they a beggar belief

1402
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:20,529
there is there is the best way to put it

1403
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:25,030
is that there are swords on this tree

1404
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:25,029
that are not yet right

1405
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:29,929
in some cases in some cases it might be

1406
01:17:27,949 --> 01:17:32,079
a short sort okay but the proportions

1407
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:33,710
are wrong okay okay okay

1408
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:36,469
you know you know what I mean like

1409
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:40,730
they're hanging down in various states

1410
01:17:36,469 --> 01:17:44,060
of of development okay

1411
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:47,718
weapons but there is one that is

1412
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:53,000
complete regret and it hangs down from a

1413
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:56,029
branch and like an apple there's a tiny

1414
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:00,380
piece of stem that goes into the pommel

1415
01:17:56,029 --> 01:18:03,409
and the bow is just pregnant with it

1416
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:05,180
like it's the sword is like drawing the

1417
01:18:03,409 --> 01:18:07,880
bow down it's so strong it's not in

1418
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:10,820
danger but the weight of this thing on

1419
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:13,100
the branch is considerable oh it's just

1420
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:16,069
like so while not walking through all

1421
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:17,600
this and it's like that so don't tell me

1422
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:19,819
about the order so you have you've come

1423
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,219
in you're the ultimate you are allowing

1424
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:24,979
way yeah you have you have projected

1425
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:28,010
your way in so there's a new right

1426
01:18:24,979 --> 01:18:30,019
friend denying and those two then we

1427
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:35,030
were like we lost yeah like we have like

1428
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:37,640
yams I think I think I'm still gonna go

1429
01:18:35,029 --> 01:18:38,029
in the back though you know so you come

1430
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,210
in last

1431
01:18:38,029 --> 01:18:41,569
yeah come in laughing he took 17 points

1432
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:45,439
of damage

1433
01:18:41,569 --> 01:18:47,119
this boy however oh good thing I I think

1434
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:49,669
I don't know my orders I mean I was

1435
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:52,550
first as soon as as soon as he crosses

1436
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:55,100
the threshold of this chamber the leaves

1437
01:18:52,550 --> 01:19:01,100
that had sort of gently been swing all

1438
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:04,400
turned instantly to face him that's him

1439
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:06,739
it just him and the light is incredible

1440
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:11,389
minding light is incredible it's like a

1441
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:14,329
radiant damage yeah okay he is not

1442
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:18,530

01:19:46,939 --> 01:19:54,319
from taking more comfort yeah

1456
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:57,260

you can't no no no dark vision and non

1463
01:20:10,309 --> 01:20:13,940

01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:15,829
to you right now I feel will do dancing

1465
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:17,808
lights inside of it to get light because

1466
01:20:15,828 --> 01:20:19,399
not that it says non magical light can't

1467
01:20:17,809 --> 01:20:20,570
eliminate it but you might be able to if

1468
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:22,460
you really wanted to see for whatever

1469
01:20:20,569 --> 01:20:25,219
reason I say what's there what's the

1470
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:26,989
radius in this bad boy eat okay I was

1471
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:30,469
going to say no I guess it'll still work

1472
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:33,019
I can have I can have lagari poked its

1473
01:20:30,469 --> 01:20:35,270
head out just ahead and then strayed

1474
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:38,449
visions with it and then it leads me

1475
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:41,119
should I want I'll prep to do that but

1476
01:20:38,448 --> 01:20:46,158
right now I'm going to stay out so can

1477
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:50,058
your comfortable darkness but but yeah

1478
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:52,429
this is the entire so imagine that their

1479
01:20:50,059 --> 01:20:59,110
roots so the stone is at the floor of

1480
01:20:52,429 --> 01:21:04,219
the stone is fit together it's not slit

1481
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:06,948
this this tree is growing out of stone

1482
01:21:04,219 --> 01:21:08,719
okay and the roots that it has in

1483
01:21:06,948 --> 01:21:12,279
addition to the ones that have formed

1484
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:15,800
that pool in front they go up the walls

1485
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:20,090
all around and the roots themselves are

1486
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:24,380
interleaved with symbols of rough

1487
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:27,050
protection and comfort okay um so I want

1488
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:30,559
to like I want to go up to the tree and

1489
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:31,670
I wanted to try touching just any part

1490
01:21:30,559 --> 01:21:35,449
of its root and see if I'm allowed to

1491
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:37,489
get close to it absolutely okay great I

1492
01:21:35,448 --> 01:21:40,698
hang back with you yeah

1493
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:42,558

1495
01:21:42,559 --> 01:21:46,880

1496
01:21:44,118 --> 01:21:48,380
I go heal it returns it I don't cross

1497
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,118

chamber is lit and nourished by a single

1609
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:35,160
shaft of light from the surface and

1610
01:27:28,069 --> 01:27:41,609
playing across these leaves you see

1611
01:27:35,159 --> 01:27:44,250

that each leaf as you saw as you go down

1614
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:55,189
from the trunk each leaf is like a page

1615
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:58,760

1616
01:27:55,189 --> 01:28:05,299
progresses throughout a relief this this

1617
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:09,320
this plant this tree is a trove is

1618
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:11,190
itself a-- a record a historical record

1619
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:11,729
but that's not the only thing that you

1620
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:13,979
notice

1621
01:28:11,729 --> 01:28:18,889
so wait there's more but wait there's

1622
01:28:13,979 --> 01:28:26,129
more as you as you pluck this ripe pod

1623
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:29,310
you can see that the roots that have

1624
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:34,230
come down from the tree and projected up

1625
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:35,590
around materially change in structure

1626
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:38,569
okay

1627
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:41,239
meaningfully they become made of

1628
01:28:38,569 --> 01:28:44,618
something like you have noticed in this

1629
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:48,979
town this odd commingling of stone and

1630
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:52,579
metal harvested by the process whatever

1631
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:55,939
is inherent in this corrupted version of

1632
01:28:52,579 --> 01:28:59,000
this seed that founded this city you are

1633
01:28:55,939 --> 01:29:03,279
seeing the true version of it you

1634
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:06,979
remember the minotaurs tale that the

1635
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:10,039
Enclave Ward with the elephant and they

1636
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:12,559
did so with the use of a siege engine

1637
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:18,130
that they planted in the surface and

1638
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:21,500
then it committed war below this tree

1639
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:24,260
has some other purpose in the heart of

1640
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:27,310
the nemah seer the corrupted NEMA's ear

1641
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:28,460
there is still a true account of the

1642
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:34,159
Enclave

1643
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:36,739
at its heart and the roots and indeed

1644
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:40,488
the central core and the branches

1645
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:45,459
themselves cease to become cease to be

1646
01:29:40,488 --> 01:29:50,329
organic shapes and they instead become

1647
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:53,469
gruesome animated Lance's of steel and

1648
01:29:50,329 --> 01:29:59,600
stone and you can see that that ring of

1649
01:29:53,469 --> 01:30:02,929
roots around it harvests leeches from

1650
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:07,130
the walls the materials it needs to

1651
01:30:02,929 --> 01:30:10,340
launch itself straight up growing

1652
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:16,060
through the ceiling the central core of

1653
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:20,150
it becomes a kind of grinding burr that

1654
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:23,840
reaches up through the ceiling along

1655
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:27,408
with its sister roots and it annihilates

1656
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:30,469
the ceiling of this chamber this is no

1657
01:30:27,408 --> 01:30:36,259
longer a safe place for living things

1658
01:30:30,469 --> 01:30:41,118
well is everyone okay here's my fantasy

1659
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:44,539
would you do I want to pick the library

1660
01:30:41,118 --> 01:30:45,750
and then the tree got mad I try to kill

1661
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:47,699
it immediately

1662
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:49,770
so I still have this thing right you

01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:54,750

Nimitz here this week on what it's not

1665
01:30:54,750 --> 01:31:00,930
gone but it is something else it is

1666
01:30:57,390 --> 01:31:06,390
taken on its purpose and it is currently

1667
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:10,159
in the process of boring out first this

1668
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:12,750
room and then presumably in a widening

1669
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:15,180
terrifying arc do you want me to drop

1670
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:19,020
darkness on you you want you this Oh

I say the central imagine of the central

core and of the trunk of this thing ran

1698
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:30,329
a blender yes you are basically at the

1699
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:33,630
bottom of a blender and it is blending

1700

NEMA's ear mm-hmm come on come on come

01:32:58,878 --> 01:33:02,840
do we feel does it feel like maybe also

1710
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:04,339
next to the chamber is not a good place

1711
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:07,449
to go like maybe this is not expected in

1712
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:12,109
it or it is a progressive revelation

1713
01:33:07,448 --> 01:33:15,138
that involves the annihilation of this

1714
01:33:12,109 --> 01:33:19,369
corrupted City and you are at that

1715
01:33:15,139 --> 01:33:25,279
epicenter of it in fact as you're

1716
01:33:19,368 --> 01:33:29,929
running down this this natural tunnel it

1717
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:32,389
is splitting overhead like a pea pod and

1718
01:33:29,929 --> 01:33:34,969
you can see daylight whoa

1719
01:33:32,389 --> 01:33:38,479
we're as far down as I thought I want to

1720
01:33:34,969 --> 01:33:40,908
you can't be [ __ ] I think you know I did

1721
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:42,909

1722
01:33:40,908 --> 01:33:47,089
be way down there

1723
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:48,469
why no no in fact rubble rubble is

1724
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:53,179
falling I mean it would not be

1725
01:33:48,469 --> 01:33:54,679

01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:05,269
jump distance is tripled until the spell

1730
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:06,948
ends and then as stoic Lee as possible

yeah you don't need that much height a

1754
01:35:10,429 --> 01:35:15,949
lot any any height that would have been

1755
01:35:12,649 --> 01:35:18,199
tuned by the additional weight is not

1756
01:35:15,949 --> 01:35:20,539
what's needed for this purpose you you

1757
01:35:18,199 --> 01:35:24,679
are running through this thing I have to

1758
01:35:20,539 --> 01:35:26,989
say it's split like this seem you're

1759
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:31,280
granted the spell you gather everyone

1760
01:35:26,989 --> 01:35:35,029
towards you and bleep out and now you

1761
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:38,750
are on a street that is being shredded

1762
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:41,179
and if you look back there's a couple

1763
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:44,090
things that you see first in the

1764
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:46,480
distance you can see

1765
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:50,989
kaalia Chiefs

1766
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:54,649
clock tower and you can see that the

1767
01:35:50,989 --> 01:35:56,989
broken clock face has begun to spin and

1768
01:35:54,649 --> 01:36:02,649
whine too fast

1769
01:35:56,989 --> 01:36:05,359
Oh to that this excites me yes I heard

1770
01:36:02,649 --> 01:36:08,809
you got that oh yeah you see a light

1771
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:12,469
around the bait of it and it just Falls

1772
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:16,039
oh and then the light ceases but you can

1773
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:20,600
see that this grinding burr but just

1774
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:23,840
ever-widening as it takes on minerals

1775
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:28,789
and steel and glass it is just

1776
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:33,319
continuing to widen like a flower as it

1777
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:37,279
grinds up through the central mound of

1778
01:36:33,319 --> 01:36:40,219
this city well that got to be excited so

1779
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:42,139
excited just having brief flashes of

1780
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:45,380
what tells it to stop no no people are

1781
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:49,010
people are terrified screaming they are

1782
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:52,369
there screaming 100% of the thread is

1783
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:53,780
strong right now this is not this is not

1784
01:36:52,369 --> 01:36:56,539
a good place to be

1785
01:36:53,779 --> 01:36:57,019
I keep everyone when there's no there's

1786
01:36:56,539 --> 01:36:58,970
none

1787
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:01,640
yeah there's no way to conceive of it

1788
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:03,920
Hulk jumplist like I don't everybody put

1789
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:07,100
in to tell you hook like a full city

1790
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:09,170
block you show up and then this is

1791
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:16,039
another another strange thing so imagine

1792
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:19,520
that as this mound is pulverized imagine

1793
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:23,149
that like pistils and stamens imagine

1794
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:26,090

arcing steel wires that burst out of the

top and then fall down in arcs around

1798
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:45,500
itself and then an additional ring

1799
01:37:38,539 --> 01:37:48,229

of the city if we can get outside the

1826
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:46,730

horse now you're special never seen one

1839
01:39:18,649 --> 01:39:22,219
is hearing more and more stuff we don't

1840
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:24,110
by the way hell we're in the cart you

1841
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:26,690
just have to embrace that cart right

1842
01:39:24,109 --> 01:39:27,079
you're saying uh you're going to win the

1843
01:39:26,689 --> 01:39:28,789
cart

1844
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:31,069
at this point at this point you are

1845
01:39:28,789 --> 01:39:36,319
actually jumping the streets are no

1846
01:39:31,069 --> 01:39:39,269
longer streets that you would walk on or

1847
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:41,670
trust we can't get the car there's

1848
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:43,470
living straight down the middle just

1849
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:45,539
like the tunnel so at this point you've

1850
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:48,390
been reduced to leaping from roof to

1851
01:39:45,539 --> 01:39:50,670
roof very cool it's the best thing

1852
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:53,910
that's ever happened our stuff best

1853
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:55,829
campaign of all time no I'm sorry cause

1854
01:39:53,909 --> 01:39:58,409
I say so you're leaping and then you can

1855
01:39:55,829 --> 01:40:02,659
you can you can see the district not the

1856
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:06,149
hammock district you can see it BAM

1857
01:40:02,659 --> 01:40:11,699
Uli's leaps into bed yes and then you're

1858
01:40:06,149 --> 01:40:17,960
you're good all spell reset that base of

1859
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:20,699
these these cracks project yay even unto

1860
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:24,270
the edges of this town now and you can

1861
01:40:20,699 --> 01:40:28,079
see the cart pathway down in a crack and

1862
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:30,930
you can see coriander's steel form it's

1863
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:34,109
probably the only weight that is keeping

1864
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:36,260
the cart from disappearing down this

1865
01:40:34,109 --> 01:40:40,759
crevice - ooh so heavy

1866
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:44,340
sorry I dare say huh uh-huh

1867
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,989
all right so does it look like there's

1868
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:48,989
any chance we can save our cart

1869
01:40:45,989 --> 01:40:52,109
I think so this is Dungeons &amp; Dragons

1870
01:40:48,989 --> 01:40:54,539
yes possible it doesn't mean I question

1871
01:40:52,109 --> 01:40:56,250
if I could do it I might have to drop

1872
01:40:54,539 --> 01:40:59,010
you kiddos off at the pool that's fine

1873
01:40:56,250 --> 01:41:01,680
one minute taking a poop no it doesn't

1874
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:03,239
is what a good parent does and they

1875
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:06,539
can't go swimming yeah we come in the

1876
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:09,239
people rise yeah yeah there's a lifetime

1877
01:41:06,539 --> 01:41:11,970
that cardiovascular yeah it's a whole

1878
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:13,739
body exercise so even now but even now

1879
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:17,490
in this district now that there's the

1880
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:21,449
central core of these wires and this

1881
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:24,750
external core this other circle around

1882
01:41:21,449 --> 01:41:29,159
that central ring now they seem to be

1883
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:31,319
hitting random places okay so we need to

1884
01:41:29,159 --> 01:41:33,899
real quick is just sending them out how

1885
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:36,689
far are we from getting out of Elvis

1886
01:41:33,899 --> 01:41:39,420
from where the cart is and where safety

1887
01:41:36,689 --> 01:41:41,489
I'm sorry maternity you'd be you would

1888
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:44,480
be able to get out of here fairly

1889
01:41:41,489 --> 01:41:47,019
quickly if you had a strong means of

1890
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:51,338
Dragonborn yeah exactly

1891
01:41:47,019 --> 01:41:53,439
a one of these one of these roma metal

1892
01:41:51,338 --> 01:41:57,578
hoarseness one of these tents one of

1893
01:41:53,439 --> 01:42:01,659
these tensile projections from the

1894
01:41:57,578 --> 01:42:06,368
Nana's ear core lands in front of the

1895
01:42:01,658 --> 01:42:11,878
cart and strikes coriander and coriander

1896
01:42:06,368 --> 01:42:11,878
dies again yeah really yeah oh I get it

1897
01:42:13,649 --> 01:42:18,338
idols yeah my god she goes back to life

1898
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:22,118
just long enough to dying and then I

1899
01:42:18,338 --> 01:42:24,939
feel betrayed by yes I quit but but but

1900
01:42:22,118 --> 01:42:29,048
you know you see one close now that you

1901
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:33,189
see now you see one of these wires close

1902
01:42:29,048 --> 01:42:35,889
by you can see that it's almost like a

1903
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:41,219
it's almost like the end of the pea vine

1904
01:42:35,889 --> 01:42:45,279
oh okay there is a reaching clever

1905
01:42:41,219 --> 01:42:48,158
nature to it oh so when it lands socket

1906
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:49,839
and strikes you can see some of the

1907
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:58,509
vital sap that you would collected

1908
01:42:49,838 --> 01:43:01,748
before you assume trying to harmonize

1909
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:04,809
this area you assume that it is

1910
01:43:01,748 --> 01:43:08,469
preparing like almost like terraforming

1911
01:43:04,809 --> 01:43:14,248
the city of men is here oh yeah

1912
01:43:08,469 --> 01:43:17,019
but the metal frame of coriander is

1913
01:43:14,248 --> 01:43:21,429
filling with this vital SAP ice it's

1914
01:43:17,019 --> 01:43:23,708
like the end of Star Trek - okay yeah

1915
01:43:21,429 --> 01:43:27,248
everybody go - I never saw no and you

1916
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:30,998
can see the seams you can see inside the

1917
01:43:27,248 --> 01:43:36,938
seams between the limbs on the neck you

1918
01:43:30,998 --> 01:43:42,238
can see you in here the vines and growth

1919
01:43:36,939 --> 01:43:44,918
tightening inside the metal form okay

1920
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:47,228
I'm all in favor just seeing how this

1921
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:51,298
plays it I am I'll follow you

1922
01:43:47,229 --> 01:43:53,079
cap it down to the yeah into the dark

1923
01:43:51,298 --> 01:43:54,189
well I don't know what's going on with

1924
01:43:53,078 --> 01:43:56,828
coriander but I think that we should

1925
01:43:54,189 --> 01:43:58,119
just try and grab our cards we will hope

1926
01:43:56,828 --> 01:43:59,199
it getting home getting there sure sure

1927
01:43:58,118 --> 01:44:01,779
task we stopped

1928
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:04,029

straight through the window and then you

1936
01:44:26,770 --> 01:44:34,750
can see just a few seconds later vines

1937
01:44:31,659 --> 01:44:38,170
and plants spreading out along the

1938
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:39,069

2009
01:47:44,448 --> 01:47:47,719

good as I described before that some of

2016
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:06,560
these roads and streets are really based

2017
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:08,420
on the capillary sort of structure

2018
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,420
inside of a leaf or screw and so some of

2019
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:13,940
them are very very tight you scrape part

2020
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:16,520
of the side off the spoiler is peeled

2021
01:48:13,939 --> 01:48:18,379
straight off the top I was so cool they

2022
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:20,300
get caught on the edge you can just jump

2023
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:24,500

2029
01:48:34,368 --> 01:48:37,848
to get back now if it catches another

2030
01:48:35,929 --> 01:48:40,128
side of the edge of the building that

2031
01:48:37,849 --> 01:48:41,719
spoiler is gone it is gone it falls on

2032
01:48:40,128 --> 01:48:44,568

the cart bursts from this back road out

2043
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:16,309
into the main vein down the middle of

2044
01:49:12,078 --> 01:49:19,929
the leaf you can see various forces of

2045
01:49:16,309 --> 01:49:24,349
the city for some inconceivable reason

2046
01:49:19,929 --> 01:49:27,019

21 as we are barreling toward these

2084
01:50:45,659 --> 01:50:50,279
gates the sound comes out of me likes of

2085
01:50:48,449 --> 01:50:52,559
which you would not have thought could

2086
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:55,559
happen it was in there it is wordless it

2087
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:58,770
is a combination of terror and joy the

2088
01:50:55,560 --> 01:51:02,760
combination of coriander being revived

2089
01:50:58,770 --> 01:51:06,120
in the city destroying itself and from

2090
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:08,900
Rosings tiny frail body you hear MA

2091
01:51:06,119 --> 01:51:12,750
as we approach the Cape it's also got a

2092
01:51:08,899 --> 01:51:16,710
horrid but basically I mean imagine like

2093
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:17,869
a just like the prow of a ship cutting

2094
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:21,140
through the water

2095
01:51:17,869 --> 01:51:24,238
guards are trying to create a scenario

2096
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:27,420
where Rosie basting ER and her best

2097
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:29,879
friend do not escape and they are not

2098
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:32,840
there's nothing they can do against this

2099
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:36,960
steel horse bronze horse right

2100
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:38,880
corriander right as the right of it just

2101
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,420
a slit where they're trying to shut this

2102
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:44,159
thing down

2103
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:47,250
the hose just BAM straight down it

2104
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:50,210
swings wide people are pouring out on

2105
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:56,449
either side of the cart behind you and

2106
01:51:50,210 --> 01:52:01,380
the destron valley branch of

2107
01:51:56,449 --> 01:52:04,679
acquisitions incorporated the inheritors

2108
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:09,420
of initiative see have escaped nimeth

2109
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:11,219
here we've got farms full of children

2110
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:13,619
yeah you're dropping them like you run

2111
01:52:11,219 --> 01:52:17,010
along that you sponsored by again and

2112
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:18,869
every day exactly sound like exactly but

2113
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:22,289
yeah like a collections bucket like

2114
01:52:18,869 --> 01:52:26,279
donations versus a couple more jumps and

2115
01:52:22,289 --> 01:52:29,460
you should be able to catch up with the

2116
01:52:26,279 --> 01:52:30,779
cart I put the kids down yeah I hope you

2117
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:33,119

jump I put the kids out at the crest

2119
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:38,670
yeah and a browser that there's a point

2120
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:39,359
at which the cart sort of lists a little

2121
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:43,710
bit to the right

2122
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:47,750
like quickly and you can see the dinar

2123
01:52:43,710 --> 01:52:50,100
is attached to the side

2124
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:52,170
costura Straub is stable to open the

2125
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:54,210
door for him he gets in the side of the

2126
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:56,730
cart and it closes everybody in their

2127
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:58,920
traditional immediately go sleep their

2128
01:52:56,729 --> 01:53:01,500
traditional time strong yeah but I I'm

2129
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:03,989
looking back at never like folding in

2130
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:07,829
yeah and that you can see now there's

2131
01:53:03,988 --> 01:53:11,899
even more of these extensions coming out

2132
01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:15,210
from the NEMA's ear itself and it is

2133
01:53:11,899 --> 01:53:17,879
surrounded in a perimeter like exactly

2134
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:19,859
along the outer edge of the city I'm

2135
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:22,409
going to drive I Drive the cart to a

2136
01:53:19,859 --> 01:53:25,859
vantage point that it's high enough that

2137
01:53:22,408 --> 01:53:27,299
walnut can get like the dopest view of

2138
01:53:25,859 --> 01:53:28,859
everything that's happening with yeah

2139
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:31,710

2140
01:53:28,859 --> 01:53:33,868
like yeah exactly I rain front row seat

2141
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:35,189
oh yeah I guess I guess we're we're safe

2142
01:53:33,868 --> 01:53:37,618
and then I get to a point where you go

2143
01:53:35,189 --> 01:53:41,399
to you can like eat all of this up yeah

2144
01:53:37,618 --> 01:53:44,729

2145
01:53:41,399 --> 01:53:47,698
a lot and at least she's she's hauling

2146
01:53:44,729 --> 01:53:52,169

these seeds and

2272
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:32,149
they grow quickly like more quickly even

2273
01:59:28,939 --> 01:59:35,029
than you expect quickly than you would

2274
01:59:32,149 --> 01:59:38,448
expect for magic seeds even even more

2275
01:59:35,029 --> 01:59:45,920

2276
01:59:38,448 --> 01:59:49,729
come and what is grown out of them

2277
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:51,500
not every one of them germinates like

2278
01:59:49,729 --> 01:59:54,559
you know what I mean like there's only

2279
01:59:51,500 --> 02:00:03,010
so much that the environment can support

2280
01:59:54,560 --> 02:00:03,010
in this zone but three pods do grow and

2281
02:00:03,579 --> 02:00:16,000
imagine them almost like like bassinets

2282
02:00:10,899 --> 02:00:20,029
imagine that a frond a healthy strong

2283
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:23,270
support comes and then growing out in a

2284
02:00:20,029 --> 02:00:28,189

every Drive there are three of them here

2289
02:00:39,289 --> 02:00:47,019
and they are growing quickly mmm maybe

2290
02:00:44,118 --> 02:00:50,598
we should leave them to what they do

2291
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:52,219

gently swaying in the breeze of this

2300
02:01:08,929 --> 02:01:11,539

02:02:00,158 --> 02:02:04,269
townspeople all right I'm going to like

2323
02:02:01,899 --> 02:02:05,979
to whisper a little fact secret

2324
02:02:04,270 --> 02:02:07,900
something over each of these three oh I

2325
02:02:05,979 --> 02:02:11,618
like they will they will need they will

2326
02:02:07,899 --> 02:02:13,988
need this these secrets it is a sort of

2327
02:02:11,618 --> 02:02:15,908
a blessing of shadow that they can use

2328
02:02:13,988 --> 02:02:19,988
to their protection in case you're of a

2329
02:02:15,908 --> 02:02:23,948

2330
02:02:19,988 --> 02:02:28,559

you are able to pull the car there are

2333
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:40,690
other carts of varying sizes pulling out

2334
02:02:37,349 --> 02:02:43,119
still skidding out of the place and then

2335
02:02:40,689 --> 02:02:47,799
finding the main road going north going

2336
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:51,689
south you can see a trading cart sort of

2337
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:51,690
up at the fork looks over the city

2338
02:02:51,779 --> 02:02:58,809
decides that's not a good place to go

2339
02:02:54,599 --> 02:03:01,569
puts the cart back on the North Road to

2340
02:02:58,810 --> 02:03:03,159
head north maybe to janar or Scala some

2355
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:39,909
importantly like where walnut grew up

and she just whispers a few just little

2357
02:03:39,908 --> 02:03:45,839
words to herself but a like a almost

2358
02:03:45,868 --> 02:03:49,168

2368
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:15,360
a real loyal top of the cards is it pop

2369
02:04:12,269 --> 02:04:17,189
up with a hip hop from Masseria mr. pol

2370

2372
02:04:21,389 --> 02:04:26,969
statue that you saw in the statuary

2373
02:04:23,998 --> 02:04:30,948

2378
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:42,479

2381
02:04:43,948 --> 02:04:47,719
everyone I care about

2382
02:04:45,529 --> 02:04:53,248
teleports behind you nothing personal -

2383
02:04:47,719 --> 02:04:57,139
oh yo yo E um what is my perception oh

2384
02:04:53,248 --> 02:04:57,139
so that's a I'm 13

2385
02:05:00,779 --> 02:05:06,119
you don't really don't you don't detect

2386
02:05:02,969 --> 02:05:09,060
anything out of the ordinary this seems

2387
02:05:06,119 --> 02:05:10,948
like there's a person on that and I say

2388
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:11,909
I recognize this in the statue and I say

2389
02:05:10,948 --> 02:05:14,250
you

2390
02:05:11,908 --> 02:05:15,629
and then I I'm trying to attack him I

2391
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:18,750
guess go for it

2392
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:20,760
okay huh what's his was his posture of

2393
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:22,198
the opposition and I hope that I say it

2394
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:27,480
loud enough that the rest of my team

2395
02:05:22,198 --> 02:05:29,369
hears that I've said you okay um me know

2396
02:05:27,479 --> 02:05:31,948
say blah you know I'm gonna attack him

2397
02:05:29,369 --> 02:05:36,408
with my um my system I pulled with my

2398
02:05:31,948 --> 02:05:38,879
cult resource ah so that would be a plus

2399
02:05:36,408 --> 02:05:41,839
what is normally at this stuff what is

2400
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:44,850
my normal life 2's plus 5

2401
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:48,840
whoops 9 anyway I just gotta swipe at

2402
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:52,079
him yeah like you ha it just goes

2403
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:55,340
immediately through his entire torso and

2404
02:05:52,079 --> 02:05:58,969
then finds purchase in the roof whoops

2405
02:05:55,340 --> 02:06:01,610
I'm ready he's waste police watching the

2406
02:05:58,969 --> 02:06:08,908
he looks back in a wash at the town I

2407
02:06:01,609 --> 02:06:13,380
know you caused this did I didn't didn't

2408
02:06:08,908 --> 02:06:18,059
didn't I didn't invent an EM Azir who

2409
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:22,529
did you're complicit in this

2410
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:27,630
the NEMA's ear is a tool used by the

2411
02:06:22,529 --> 02:06:31,529
witches of the enclave to assault the

2412
02:06:27,630 --> 02:06:36,300
Underdark I took a weapon turned into a

2413
02:06:31,529 --> 02:06:39,630
city a city that you destroyed but it

2414
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:45,570
does grow from a seed so there may be

2415
02:06:39,630 --> 02:06:48,270
franchise opportunities come on cuz what

2416
02:06:45,569 --> 02:06:49,948
do you why did you make this city what

2417
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:55,050
do you want what did you stand to gain

2418
02:06:49,948 --> 02:06:59,059
from this this time it was an

2419
02:06:55,050 --> 02:07:06,480
interesting experiment but I serve an

2420
02:06:59,060 --> 02:07:12,620
entity far greater than this world and I

2421
02:07:06,479 --> 02:07:12,619
need to discern ways to serve her better

2422
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:19,170
if that means I fail on occasion her

2423
02:07:16,529 --> 02:07:24,349
power is sufficient to absorb it and

2424
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:24,349
wellness says you served it betrayer

2425
02:07:25,099 --> 02:07:32,219
that's a point of view and I say I serve

2426
02:07:29,639 --> 02:07:34,559
nailless just even hearing the word

2427
02:07:32,219 --> 02:07:38,519
she's like she is that the overwhelming

2428
02:07:34,559 --> 02:07:42,809
urge to punch an incorporeal person um

2429
02:07:38,519 --> 02:07:53,729
I say so what what are you here to do

2430
02:07:42,809 --> 02:08:01,159

2431
02:07:53,729 --> 02:08:01,159

02:16:39,429 --> 02:16:47,049
the the open areas to the right there is

2590
02:16:43,209 --> 02:16:52,869
a stove a stage and a painting over the

2592
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:57,520
bar to the left you get behind the bar

2593
02:16:55,120 --> 02:17:01,570
by going past it and in okay behind

2594
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:03,399
there is a fairly simple larder but

2595
02:17:01,569 --> 02:17:05,199
anything that you use to cook and bake

2596
02:17:03,399 --> 02:17:07,659
is going to be behind that and then

2597
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:09,219
around there's an area that's not

2598
02:17:07,659 --> 02:17:10,690

2599
02:17:09,218 --> 02:17:13,449

2616
02:17:54,270 --> 02:18:00,849
back of the bar and then she goes out
