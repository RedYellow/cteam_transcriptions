then the word was the wrong word onward

60
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,280

74
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,659
were so many options yes you did now and

75
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,459
then well great ways to consume this

76
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:37,048
come and Wow and those oh hey youtubes

77
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,150

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,188
minute well at last he would have

79
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,650
watched it you know to far under APIs of

80
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:45,750
choice I had built all this up as like a

81
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,299
scenario for me to like become

82
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,799
increasingly angry but now I realize

83
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,000
that it's perfect for you not to know

84
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,650
because your character wasn't there

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,840
that's the metagame in gray the

86
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,609
mitigating potential is is constrained

87
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,229
substantial impacts your Intel's right

88
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:59,879
now suppose yeah yeah and then I just

89
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,159
realized that there's another problem

90
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,228

91
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,989

116
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:21,939
exactly what this is my power I see that

117
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:29,399
fanfic and just stamp huh Wow BAM

118
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:32,860
but as the party boarded the vessel

119
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,870
examined it were taken on a tour you

120
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,080
know in the / you know in the pursuit of

121
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,350
their security tasks the incredibly

122
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:44,079
clever walnut Don grass got a glimpse

123
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,660
inside the vault and saw that the

124
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,240
treasure that they had heard about was

125
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,400
not even contained therein I thought

126
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,538
that was very very classy for a long

127
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,728
time I couldn't figure out what you were

128
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:56,680
doing and then I was like I want it you

129
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:58,300
know I didn't know what you're doing but

130
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,800
I supported you on a break you know and

131
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,430
that now I was playing with you and that

132
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,960
actually looked a better play now but

133
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,319
different members of the party were

134
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,569
given were given different tasks by Mela

135
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,759
for who is basically the head of

136
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:19,629
security on the Dragons ward share and

137
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:22,810
Rosie were basically working the room

138
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:27,038
dinar was assigned directly to spook off

139
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,288
the returned an agent of the six he's

140
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,509
been assigned to be a sort of wingman

141
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:34,709
type figure but it's almost like a

142
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:37,920
reverse bodyguard insofar as Lou goth

143
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:39,779
Creek causes so many problems

144
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,210
it's worth having a guard assigned to

145
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,449
him just to protect the rest of the

146
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:49,680
vessel from him and then you know what

147
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:55,110
can be said about Brahma Lu da's private

148
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,759

is the reason i can't sanction the other

154
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,649
fanfic it's because you have your own

155
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,470

156
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:23,639

market wide open

175
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:21,269

able to they extend her

186
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:56,149
the player role there's a slight benefit

187
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,920
to being the player it could it could be

188
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,110
an issue maybe they think that they

189
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,179
can't lose maybe they have a high

190
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,209
opinion of themselves because they

191
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:08,088
exclusively play Lich's who are bad at

192
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:10,609
dice so all right

193
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,680
yeah well discipline this I don't think

194
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,209
it's in general I feel like a powerful

195
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,649
undead Lich could probably do something

196
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,388
to manipulate the chance but they're

197
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:21,828
afraid to roll by my dice again oh

198
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:25,789
what's ya know positive positive

00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:30,309

yeah please continue so one of the birds

230
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,000
that when I when akka through Stroud

231
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:02,659
enters his private chambers here at the

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,759
doone-gate

233
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:06,828
and what is that process like for him

234
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,850
and I'm in my mind I just see you sort

235
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:09,138
of like standing at the edge of the bed

236
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,759
and then you just like fall down and

237
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,919
they sleep there and then get back up

238
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,789
but I bet it's different than that I

239
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:20,778
think that I typically might my

240
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:23,269
nighttime and waking rituals involve a

241
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:25,458
lot of self questioning and guilt

242
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:28,278
because and the question I asked at the

243
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:31,399
end of the day is have I are taken too

244
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:35,028

245
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:38,059
close to these pointless physical

246
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:40,730
pleasures this this pathetic husk which

247
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,119
we all inhabit one of right like some

248
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,670

well not if I do some subject note on

414
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:40,190
the least well this is I dragons the

415
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:41,840
entire game is about checking out less

416
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,490
things before you drink them let's see

417
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,980
some drinks Archana

418
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,788
and looking at doors yeah yeah and I

419
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,889
roll the dice like that I mean

420
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:52,079
the dice are different from yours yes I

421
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:55,439
mean euphemistically Romi yeah

422
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:59,788
that literally McKenna that's going to

423
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:03,929
be a 16 yeah you think what in the way

424
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:08,940
that in the way that an acid break

425
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:10,859
things breaks things apart this just

426
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,259
from the dist from the word go that's

427
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:14,489
just its nature yeah you put something

428
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:18,058
in there and it would eventually become

429
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:21,028
a liquid version of its original self

430
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:22,158
this takes things apart with some kind

431
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:25,679
of purpose

432
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:29,309
like I like it reconfigures yeah like a

433
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,210
strategic purpose that's that's a check

434
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:35,729
in the don't drink column let's see

435
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:39,419
that's really my only check that I care

436
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:40,528
to make can i intimidate if you ensue of

437
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,909

slats of the floor down into the first

485
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,039
floor pour down through those slats and

486
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:28,769
then begin to travel at tremendous speed

487
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,829
underground Wow and over land where

488
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:33,509
underground doesn't work and then you

489
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:33,990
occasionally have to go even lower than

490
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,579
that

491
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,769
traveling along and through but

to the future sorry villain Ted kind of

500
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:01,679
situation where you leave us a note and

501
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:04,930

510
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,840
metaphor I'm going to get a lot of value

00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:25,009
so that it's edge just cuts out that

548
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:27,950
that part of the Sun come on thank you

549
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:30,558
that's right angle in those like yeah

550
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,590
that what our weather clientele is into

551
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:38,960
spot this is this is the the cream of

552
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:42,109
whatever crop this is could be judging

553
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,789
judging by the the location like v2v the

554
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:49,279
Sun the water could be water deep how

555
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:52,099
far that it's south of red larger ways

556
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,808
yeah but not me not an infinite distance

557
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:56,899
but I don't have any time today a long

558
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:59,089
ways to no drift no it's not it's not

559
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,610
conscious like that yeah you just have a

560
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:03,829
sense of the passage okay and the speed

561
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:07,099
but not the time

562
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:08,899
how's my angle ver so I think this is a

563
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:11,869
this is a side effect of it you don't

564
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,910
experience you don't have it okay that's

565
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:16,069
great good news I pick up that menu I

566
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,570
guess yeah like every time I drink this

567
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:20,569
is we're going to have you in eternal

568
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,609
cuddle I know yeah oh I can see why

569
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:28,099
people have you know I'm not against

570
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:31,209
this beverage and you you reach for the

571
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:34,428
menu and tip it up and over the menu

572
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:37,340
your dining companion is also looking at

573
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:42,019
the menu oh describe this companion but

574
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:45,500
this is a drow woman and so almost

575
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:52,369
instantly just purely from a raw

576
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:56,329
cultural perspective just like you know

577
00:27:52,369 --> 00:28:00,308
you are from a matriarchal society just

578
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:04,579
the pressure like the disparity in your

579
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:06,529
relative social position even here in

580
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:09,049
this place like to be seated by each

581
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:12,859
other directly across from each other

582
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:17,029

583
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:19,219
age compared to mine similar okay so I

give or take 100 yeah who's coming in

586

so like casual about it

588
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:37,839
oh she laughs but if there's no there's

589
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,410
no edge in it okay there's no edge in it

590
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:43,869

591
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:46,360

curatorial selection but right it'll

670
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:30,298

682
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:06,359
role to remember yeah there you go

683
00:34:02,898 --> 00:34:07,949
Obama symbol no but it doesn't it's a

684
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,809
narrative doesn't like yeah turned on

685
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:12,329
the other side and say this like a the

686
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:14,190
six items line on the bottom part of the

687
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:15,719
glyph I didn't even notice I did not

688
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,789
make this symbol up it's an actual

689
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,759
old-school symbols oh then I then I

690
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:25,469
don't know it but maybe Catrice does yes

691
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,599
so is it reject well it's going to be a

692
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:30,678
eighteen or nineteen sorry I guess I

693
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,869
know it yeah you remember it not from

694
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:37,980
[Applause]

695
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:43,950
scholarship but I have a hazy image of

696
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:47,369
seeing it in two places one in the Black

697
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:49,259
Gate that you saw in the gullet of the

698
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:51,030
wandering crypt it was one of them and

699
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,830
it's also one of the symbols that was

700
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:58,200
burned underneath the glass in the that

701
00:34:55,829 --> 00:35:01,348
vaulted cave that it escaped through

702
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:06,230
okay so this is a real quipped this is a

703
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:09,050
business this is a novel this is a novel

704
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:13,199
entry yes

705
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:15,380
certified crit yeah yes from the from

706
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:20,789
the Christmas wanders this says a lot of

707
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:24,180
holes a lot of intrigue for me yeah just

708
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:29,000
wandering crypt business I think that

709
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:36,529
that has the that has the unnecessary

710
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:40,260
poetry that one has to endure a lot of

711
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:43,710
around almond drawn that was my

712
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:47,040
experience as well yeah yeah yeah well

713
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:50,970
we're obviously we're not completely

714
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:55,500
unfamiliar with your work that's good

715
00:35:50,969 --> 00:36:00,108
because I am a lot of the time how do

716
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:03,659
you think you came to lose your powers

717
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:07,588
that is the question I'm trying to ask

718
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:09,480
but how long would you say after you

719
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:14,699
began working for acquisitions

720
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:18,440
incorporated what was the period of time

721
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:26,868
between you being a powerful warlock and

722
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:30,240
you going back to warlock school one day

723
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:33,750
well ray days the airship ride lasted a

724
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:39,019
while I would peg it at about seven days

725
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:45,960
to lose so much of what I had accrued

726
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:53,480
hmm well yeah she's not your right hand

727
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:56,670
hmm and a plate close on that is called

728
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,588
yeah oh yeah yeah oh really yeah yeah

729
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,730
yeah oh yeah exactly

730
00:36:58,588 --> 00:37:01,078
and adults on I haven't thought about

731
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,829
that working here I'm talking right now

732
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,950
yeah

733
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:08,630
the tray comes out in this set in front

734
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:15,239
of you and when the top of it is lifted

735
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:18,930
you see a chunk of black stone that has

736
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:21,409
emblazoned on it this symbol that was on

737
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,409
the note

738
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:29,460
and it's sort of like they seem like a

739
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:30,989
like a metal like a pie plate yeah but

740
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,139
if it's drops and sort of leaves and has

741
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:36,929
rolls around like this it is as soon as

742
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:40,460
the top is removed it begins to sort of

743
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:42,899
undulate in a circular pattern on that

744
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:45,809
but on the train I've instinctively

745
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,180
reached for mine just to get after that

746
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:54,779
hold on exactly and it they want to be

747
00:37:48,179 --> 00:38:00,919
together any day because this is a show

748
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:05,190
of faith from drawn enterprises

749
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:10,079
obviously your powers aren't what they

750
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:12,059
were but we like the we let the growth

751
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,529
track you're on right now

752
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:18,329
we like the career arc we see and the

753
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:23,490
fact that matter is that you wouldn't

754
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:26,190
have to work for us to work for us we

755
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:27,959
could work together even while you

756
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:34,230
remain a part owner of acquisitions

757
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:35,960
incorporated tokens okay I was trying to

758
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:39,269
find a way to work to let the in there

759
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:43,429
to let the kiss of Newt help doesn't

760
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:45,809
work so can either we get in closer some

761
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:54,089
spooky action at a distance that's for

762
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:55,769
the physics yes duh she's like I say I'm

763
00:38:54,090 --> 00:39:00,900
not not listening

764
00:38:55,769 --> 00:39:06,380
yeah with every you take a very long

765
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:12,090
time to go through absolutely everything

766
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:14,250
we know about you sir drought but we can

767
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:17,850
cover some of the highlights the

768
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:19,630
greatest hits right that won't take too

769
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:25,179
long

770
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:27,190
so when you encountered but again

771
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:29,889
wandering crypt there's a bit of

772
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:33,429
unnecessary poetry there the terminology

773
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:38,679
that we deploy which we feel is superior

774
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:44,829
and contains descriptive power is shard

775
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:49,259
lling now have you noticed when you cast

776
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:52,630
certain spells that shards are brought

777
00:39:49,260 --> 00:40:00,810
to the surface of the planet have you

778
00:39:52,630 --> 00:40:07,950
seen this oh the when I invoke my

779
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:10,989
tentacles that entity that you are in a

780
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:15,489
love-hate relationship with is that

781
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:18,909
accurate I'm just like it's like uh it's

782
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:27,429
like Street magic well my my see give me

783
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:30,539
what you're examining here this one of

784
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:34,929
the fascinating things that it does is

785
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:41,050
send pieces of itself to find its next

786
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:46,750
meal but something odd happened when it

787
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:50,580
did that here there were a race of

788
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:55,659
druids that made the difference on our

789
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:59,529
planet and took this world off the menu

790
00:40:55,659 --> 00:41:05,920
at least for a time when the shard

791
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:11,980
landed they built a living prison around

792
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:15,519
the shard and they were confident that

793
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:19,510
as had happened at other times this

794
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:23,440
prison would hold but the shard is much

795
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:28,990
much being a part of a god a good child

796
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,950
of it in a way it had a cleverness about

797
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:34,769
it

798
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:39,699
and it transformed that living prison

799
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:41,250
into a body for itself it grew and grew

800
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:43,480
and grew

801
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:47,619
wandering crypt for lack of a better

802
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,469
term so that's we're going to say

803
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:53,050
burrowing crypt no the only does that

804
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:57,009
yeah it's a mob I'm telling you this

805
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:59,800
problems with the turn right we all talk

806
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:02,380
about it it's not a bad name yeah isn't

807
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:06,730
terrible yeah it really is something

808
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:10,119
else but doesn't that that's neither

809
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:12,880
here nor there you have spent some time

810
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:18,000
in the Charlaine correct yes

811
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,230
now what stopped you from going further

812
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,510
again out of character Manette sir I'm

813
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:25,269
going to have to remember what's tapas I

814
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:29,829
guess so we had we had encountered

815
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:32,289
Devine indeed later when you came back

816
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:33,339
inside the crypt itself this would be

817
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:36,219
good for everybody

818
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:38,889
yeah it's worth heads up right this

819
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:41,259
Black Gate okay it's been real circled

820
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:43,059
by symbols and there are three in the

821
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,720
middle when you interacted with it at

822
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:50,230
that time you had a single symbol right

823
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:52,899
but my focus began to that unfolds at

824
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:54,550
reduce more visible exactly I was going

825
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,720
on to that gate and try to communicate

826
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:01,750
with it right and I was ripped away by

827
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:03,578
my teammates because yeah it was a mean

828
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,050
situation couldn't get big meaning they

829
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:08,859
don't like and the room was filling with

830
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:11,289
apathy happen yeah so I so in regular

831
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:13,179
spectacular group yeah yeah they were

832
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:15,608
freaking I use I use my special power

833
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:18,399
and the power failed by the mouth god

834
00:43:15,608 --> 00:43:23,440
yeah exactly to harm you and you argue

835
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:28,480
entitled him he says she says look I I

836
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:34,179
know that there is I know that your

837
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:40,650
employer has an interest in this crypt

838
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:43,449
that is beyond the purely archaeological

839
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:46,800
he believes certain things

840
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:53,019
about the contents of this crypt that

841
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:59,080
there are no proofs of any kind for but

842
00:43:53,019 --> 00:44:03,150
here is how we can work together should

843
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:07,920
you enter their shard link a second time

844
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:13,230
you may find yourself passing through

845
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:17,950
first three doors and then two doors

846
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:23,349
than two beyond the last of these doors

847
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:25,179
you will see a silver curtain what we

848
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:28,509
had drawn enterprises would like you to

849
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:33,789
do is to kill anything that comes out of

850
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:39,550
it what from what my letter what it says

851
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:44,230
well no matter what it claims no matter

852
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:52,390
what it does and in exchange we can

853
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:54,400
sever the link that you have to this GOG

854
00:44:52,389 --> 00:45:00,400
you have right now that may not be a

855
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:02,410
favorite it's not great god we're aware

856
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:09,099
of it we've had we have had agents in

857
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:10,230
the past who from one you know one way

858
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:14,049
or another

859
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:17,380
ended up in its management structure for

860
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:20,740
lack of a better term and it was a

861
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:22,720
negative experience for all parties but

862
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:25,259
you would believe that we know we know

863
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,489
how to do it and we can do that for you

864
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:33,340
anything that comes out of that silver

865
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:36,250
curtain must be destroyed and how did

866
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:39,250
you come by this knowledge how familiar

867
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:42,340
are you with this shard link are you

868
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:45,639
familiar with drawn enterprises only

869
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:48,840
crew saw really well certainly you know

870
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:53,239
a minute is Hereward drawn or no up

871
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:56,690
sadly yes yeah well

872
00:45:53,239 --> 00:46:00,608
he's not the only drunk I shouldn't add

873
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:03,530
I also heard that he has two sisters

874
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:07,909
auspicious and pretentious yes and I

875
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:09,829
would like a character I had seen them

876
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:11,929
dead oh yeah you and you are a good

877
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:14,300
listener where you are 100% right sure

878
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:16,460
in the right time you are 100% right to

879
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,859
ask me this question that is the right

880
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,550
question to ask that back right now back

881
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:22,969
to kiss risk

882
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:27,740
I saw them dead we had retrieved their

883
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:35,868
bodies yeah she says my mistress is very

884
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:38,989
much alive which mistress mmm keep em to

885
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:41,630
you sorry I'm nothing like that no maybe

886
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:44,088
when you say which mistress you hear a

887
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,510
laugh for another table and she looks

888
00:46:44,088 --> 00:46:53,960
over at them and they look at her and

889
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:55,520
then she says he's good you just need to

890
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,539
notice that there are more and more eyes

891
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:08,539
on you from different tables hazings

892
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:11,389
oh geez yeah now in my in catharsis

893
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:14,650
memory is able to tell because I

894
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:17,118
personally do not recall which one a

895
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:20,510
special attention was the one with their

896
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,030
head crushed and thus was disfigured no

897
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:25,670
they were beyond ready on yeah but they

898
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,380
were both in very very bad shape they

899
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:31,818
live in a table that the one who was not

900
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:33,619
identifiable not her that is exactly the

901
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:37,639
question you should be asking I can't

902
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:39,769
say as Jerry K Hawkins oh no you know

903
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:43,239
Danny Matteson he wouldn't answer

904
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:46,818
yeah well I'm asking I'm asking this

905
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:49,729

do ya do we ask and she will be indebted

909
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:04,548
to you profoundly indebted there's no

910
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,759
there is no telling the heights you

911
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,670
could reach

912
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:14,660
in an organization that takes such an

913
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:14,659
active interest in its employees

914
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:21,869
forgive me but I I don't seek height I

915
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:25,500
seek knowledge

916
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:29,190
yes fellows now I don't seek I say seek

917
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:33,719
knowledge but if height is the way to

918
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:34,320
attain that knowledge then we'll see

919
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,669
what I can do

920
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,539
where do you go where you want to see

921
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:44,880
everything I'm surprised that you have

922
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:50,159
been able to resist this treat for so

923
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,800
long here on the platter I think we're

924
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:56,250
all very surprised

925
00:48:51,800 --> 00:49:00,570
we had a betting pool you know which way

926
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:04,190
did you bet you still have it you still

927
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,190
have a chance to make me some money here

928
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:18,260
in my mind there was a there was a test

929
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:21,420
occurring and at worst a opportunity for

930
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:23,690
my focus and this focus to absorb one

931
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,690
another

932
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:29,690
and I needed more information before I

933
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:32,669
would allow that to happen

934
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:35,400
you understand I'm not posed in the

935
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:38,210
slightest all our calculations have been

936
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,210
very clear on this point

937
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:47,509
be aware that

938
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:51,219
my focus is already as absorbed or

939
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:54,890
pressed is polluted by another schedule

940
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:57,230
this one and I do this there's somebody

941
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:58,549
else I come in and I do that in order

942
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,809
you are in the world that you want

943
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:05,780
winces Walker migration a little bit it

944
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:12,380
goes like this some reason she didn't

945
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:16,640
know she says I'm going to be out about

946
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:21,590
ten gold but you don't have to absorb it

947
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:23,989
now I have every faith that you will and

948
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:26,570
when you do you will be a better tool

949
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:29,618
for our purpose but there's no reason

950
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:32,059
for you to do it now I will you single

951
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:33,619
but you don't have to it is tingle

952
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:34,820
you're going to only ten gold if you

953
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:37,280
ever come and work for us

954
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:40,930
but you don't have to if you have ten

955
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,930
gold and you can give it to me now that

956
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:48,108
would be amazing

957
00:50:43,929 --> 00:50:49,819
I'm looking to hear I'm like feeling the

958
00:50:48,108 --> 00:50:52,489
table a little bit to see if it's like

959
00:50:49,820 --> 00:51:00,740

in billion if I were to if I were to

962
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:10,608

963
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:13,190
for the sigil but I have to drink

964
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:15,949
another vial is that the easiest method

965
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,130
of transit we have ways of of contacting

979
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:10,699
arrangement I have would be this God

980
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:15,650

new people because there's no way

1071
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,289

he tries to do the cheers on the side of

1315
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:45,969
the face again what is likely here is

1316
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:53,140
just on the side of the face all that

1317
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:54,609
hard dodge it look sell cheer he he

1318
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:58,900

01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:08,349
about the man that I work for all right

1321
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,750
yeah I want to hear about you making a

1322
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:17,940
lot of good points about omens so far

1323
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:20,770
you driving him bet so working for omen

1324
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:22,389
it's just it really is just a matter of

1325
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,489
time until he decides he's more

1326
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:26,829
important than you maybe you can

1327
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:31,179
understand that maybe that's a joke he

1328
01:12:26,829 --> 01:12:34,479
would make but he's the one that wins a

1329
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:36,190
hundred percent of these you the game

1330
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:42,129
the game he plays is not one other

1331
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:45,579
people can win so imagine imagine that

1332
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:48,640
you worked for him dutifully in one of

1333
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:54,579
his larger one of a larger franchised

1334
01:12:48,640 --> 01:13:00,789
offices and then imagine that you were

1335
01:12:54,579 --> 01:13:06,460
told you had been granted power to

1336
01:13:00,789 --> 01:13:10,449
defend that place and then when they

1337
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:13,029
when the enemy rolled through you were

1338
01:13:10,449 --> 01:13:16,300
annihilated now what happened with me

1339
01:13:13,029 --> 01:13:18,909
that's a choice he'd save one guy you

1340
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:21,610
can save another guy the end of the day

1341
01:13:18,909 --> 01:13:23,529
somebody's still getting saved maybe

1342
01:13:21,609 --> 01:13:28,509
just maybe you just that's the hug hand

1343
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:31,050
you got don't this is cruelty that's

1344
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:31,050

1476
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:29,939
your opposition to the plan was yeah we

1477
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:32,579
were all any screenings but I think well

01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:35,009
we are in front of the place that needs

1479
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:39,329

01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:42,869
that's the case is there any can you

1481
01:20:39,329 --> 01:20:45,019

for like am I the only drow in the place

1491
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,769

looks

1493
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:08,730
yeah and that works for us yeah but I

1494
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:11,189
think the clientele here is pretty

1495
01:21:08,729 --> 01:21:13,469

1496
01:21:11,189 --> 01:21:17,099

of like coming through the last part

1530
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:39,979
he's starting to develop an unsettling

1531
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:43,100
level of interest that you are able to

1532
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:45,229
tamp down in addressable in a timely

1533
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:48,680
fashion if you think I'm taking too long

1534
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:53,859
you just you just it's awesome all day

1535
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:58,550
yeah okay so evening exactly so you have

1536
01:22:53,859 --> 01:23:01,399
your very own Chris Chris job I mean

1537
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:07,400
it's what everybody wants this Christmas

1538
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:08,210
this Christmas anyway the way the way

1539
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:12,670
that it works

1540
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:17,600
Chris is that you you have a natural

1541
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:21,020
attunement to shadow and so for you it's

1542
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:23,539
not a sophisticated process you you are

1543
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:26,480
just aware of it like you would be any

1544
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:29,119
other phenomena its behavior is known to

1545
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:32,299
you forecast RIS you just notice

1546
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:35,180
something is odd here but you don't know

1547
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:38,000
what it is hmm odd in front of the vault

1548
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:41,320
or exactly sort of vault itself is

1549
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:45,739
actually paired with the living quarters

1550
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:48,889
it's one place they live eat and sleep

1551
01:23:45,739 --> 01:23:52,010
around the actual vault what Rosie and

1552
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:56,750
share have found is something else

1553
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:59,449
entirely a secret door here in the guts

1554
01:23:56,750 --> 01:24:01,340
of the ship right okay

1555
01:23:59,449 --> 01:24:03,920
is there any kind of perceptions that I

1556
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:06,980
can do on it since I'm so familiar with

1557
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:09,319
leaves of shadow refer for right now

1558
01:24:06,979 --> 01:24:11,149
that there isn't anything that that

1559
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:14,719
needs doing I mean you literally see

1560
01:24:11,149 --> 01:24:18,349
this like a like a physical like a

1561
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:21,020
shadow mist okay sort of pouring out of

1562
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:23,360
these doors and breathing in it like it

1563
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,530
to you it's as plain as day okay there

1564
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:29,750
is a secret door

1565
01:24:24,529 --> 01:24:31,939
osei-san see okay and there's a smoke

1566
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:35,210
this is billowing around the door hinge

1567
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:36,919
and just share see it but I don't think

1568
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:39,469
that share is attuned to shadow

1569
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,730
this is a process that you have I

1570
01:24:39,469 --> 01:24:43,698
understand you learned from your

1571
01:24:40,729 --> 01:24:45,289
monastery okay so I all I know is that

1572
01:24:43,698 --> 01:24:46,669
this shadow is cast into a secret door

1573
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:49,789
and we should totally open that door

1574
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:54,109
okay explore slash examines yes you hear

1575
01:24:49,789 --> 01:24:57,170
a throughout that when you were up on

1576
01:24:54,109 --> 01:25:00,738
the main floor there was a way of there

1577
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:02,380
was a way of projecting a voice that

1578
01:25:00,738 --> 01:25:04,849
could be heard and the music as well

1579
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:08,329
there's a way of projecting the voice

1580
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:10,219
all around and that for those voice

1581
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:14,029
projections are apparently audible even

1582
01:25:10,219 --> 01:25:19,698
down here below the ship because you

1583
01:25:14,029 --> 01:25:22,460
hear a voice that says in 15 minutes

1584
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:26,659
prepare yourselves for a night of

1585
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:34,730
incredible music from our own Bramall

1586
01:25:26,659 --> 01:25:38,269
ooh yay oh my girl oh and so yeah it's

1587
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:41,509
like it's funny like a slapstick

1588
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:44,540
slapstick tear funny trying to give the

1589
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:46,369
clothes on fast hmm like it's not a

1590
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:48,619
hundred percent working and no one wants

1591
01:25:46,369 --> 01:25:53,510
to put them on so the whole thing sucks

1592
01:25:48,619 --> 01:25:57,409
but you come to you come to some you

1593
01:25:53,510 --> 01:26:00,980

1594
01:25:57,409 --> 01:26:03,639
acceptable for leaving the suite and

1595
01:26:00,979 --> 01:26:07,159

upon this and like say what are my

1625
01:27:40,529 --> 01:27:49,920
chances right okay um so walnut is um

1626
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:52,739
anytime they have to pass through any

1627
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:55,050
kind of entryway she gets in front of

1628
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:57,179
Rama so she can enter first okay um and

1629
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:59,159
looks around and then you know just

1630
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:01,079
gives her that like she knows to just

1631
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:03,059
keep going cuz she promised but yes does

1632
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:04,260
the cursory look and then when she's

1633
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:07,110
moving through a space

1634
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:10,560
she is directly behind her hands on the

1635
01:28:07,109 --> 01:28:14,389
Scimitar for mother and is keeping her

1636
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:17,430
eyes on her the entire time I love it so

1637
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:20,160
she's sort of leading mmm of course

1638
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:22,110
Romilly yeah exactly so I listen I just

1639
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:24,059
nothing I don't understand about this I

1640
01:28:22,109 --> 01:28:27,569
see this Merc I know what's going on so

1641
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:30,270
you you get all the way all the way down

1642
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:34,920
then where are you wait like where are

1643
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:36,840
you during the performance hmm um well

1644
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,159
I'm her personal detail so I'm assuming

1645
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,680
we like go through some kind of green

1646
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:46,349
room situation

1647
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:47,579
so I'm backstage you know when you're

1648
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:50,280
waiting in the wings they can look out

1649
01:28:47,579 --> 01:28:51,960
so just doing round so I can look out

1650
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:54,359
and see if there's anything like I have

1651
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:57,390
eyes on the crowd because I'm but sad

1652
01:28:54,359 --> 01:28:59,339
but out of someone lower tier yeah yeah

1653
01:28:57,390 --> 01:29:01,440
exactly so you sort of looking up but

1654
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:02,550
you can see the looking at us looking at

1655
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:05,428
the crown I can say

1656
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:08,820
exactly and her back is to the glass

1657
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:09,960
wall itself yeah okay all right I like

1658
01:29:08,819 --> 01:29:14,368
what I'm seeing

1659
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:18,179
Brahma okay even even even just

1660
01:29:14,368 --> 01:29:22,078
preparing this loop for a performance is

1661
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:27,270
a performance like she's you are there

1662
01:29:22,078 --> 01:29:30,988
you were you like it the most but there

1663
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:35,460
is a look a pre-flight check that goes

1664
01:29:30,988 --> 01:29:37,948
on for the for the loop and maybe at an

1665
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:40,408
earlier point in her career she would

1666
01:29:37,948 --> 01:29:44,698
have she would have been more discreet

1667
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:46,769
about the Arsenal that is present in

1668
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:49,439
this thing but that's not that's not

1669
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:54,139
where she's at at her at her care of

1670
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:56,219
notoriety and performance there is

1671
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:58,469
knowing that this music is being played

1672
01:29:56,219 --> 01:30:04,109
on a weapon of mass destruction

1673
01:29:58,469 --> 01:30:05,429
is part of the lure sure I get it so

1674
01:30:04,109 --> 01:30:09,179
she's been playing she's been playing

1675
01:30:05,429 --> 01:30:13,980

1676
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:16,500

have been in this position I'm not proud

1702
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:26,310
of it there was one time where I got so

1703
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:30,390
drunk this is not a character this is

1704
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:33,030
actually Jared cave or camp that my

1705
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:35,010
fleece was configured such that it had

1706
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:38,719
those sort of like flexible draw strings

1707
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:42,300
for the pockets and I walked by a

1708
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:44,130
pinball table and I one of them got

1709
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:46,350
caught on there oh yeah and there was a

1710
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:49,680
not insignificant period of time where I

1711
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:52,079
thought there was a force field yeah

1712
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:54,690
right that's the situation if I were

1713
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:56,039
here he wants to get off of the stool he

1714
01:31:54,689 --> 01:31:58,229
thinks that he's going to turn and do

1715
01:31:56,039 --> 01:32:00,750
like a tough thing and he actually falls

1716
01:31:58,229 --> 01:32:06,449
back off of the stool yeah

1717
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:10,289
and hits his back and then rolls up

1718
01:32:06,449 --> 01:32:14,429
quick and picks up the stool and throws

1719
01:32:10,289 --> 01:32:16,260

directly at him and it's I mean you it

1811
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:31,560
didn't require Arkana

1812
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:36,510
to know that this song is materially

1813
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:40,310
changed rope in complexity so it was

1814
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:43,739
loose limbs are sweet and classical like

1815
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:46,050

1816
01:37:43,738 --> 01:37:48,959
a grandparents like this is like the

1817
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:52,050
songs of old but executed with taste and

1818
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,850
style this has a lot of percussion

1819
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:56,159
like slapped against the front of the

1820
01:37:53,850 --> 01:37:58,710
lead like that everything has just

1821
01:37:56,159 --> 01:38:02,099
changed and like you can just see that

1822
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:05,760
the tendons in her arm flexing as she

1823
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:08,970
that she performs this piece yeah I mean

1824
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:11,520
yeah and then live and then get into it

1825
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:14,130
he has so he has gotten this other

1826
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:17,370
dagger and he's put it up and then as

1827
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:20,329
soon as that music starts to play he

1828
01:38:17,369 --> 01:38:24,420
just drops it and it falls behind him

1829
01:38:20,329 --> 01:38:30,390
and then he starts to walk in sort of a

1830
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:36,560
staccato music word and it's sort of a

1831
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:41,070
stutter steps way toward the edge of the

1832
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:43,620
of the upper tier and he is walking over

1833
01:38:41,069 --> 01:38:48,119
to the edge and holding onto the post

1834
01:38:43,619 --> 01:38:50,699
and he's like putting his leg up in Troy

1835
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:53,099
like he is trying to he is trying to

1836
01:38:50,699 --> 01:39:00,720

house is it that's what I was asking I

1969
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:54,739
was trying to figure out whether or not

1970
01:44:53,149 --> 01:44:56,539
I could send the body through a minute

1971
01:44:54,738 --> 01:44:58,218
and then the misty stepping aside but

1972
01:44:56,539 --> 01:45:04,488
doesn't seem like a good ass snake in

1973
01:44:58,219 --> 01:45:06,500
here okay okay alright can I can i peek

1974
01:45:04,488 --> 01:45:08,259

sure anyone else could do this even then

1980
01:45:19,670 --> 01:45:23,480
it's sort of like it's like when you

1981
01:45:22,189 --> 01:45:26,389
look at like it looks like the view

1982
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:28,609
around the edge of a lens yeah where

1983
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:31,730
it's just sort of warped a little bit

1984
01:45:28,609 --> 01:45:36,439
but you can see up this close you think

1985
01:45:31,729 --> 01:45:40,339
that you hear water but inside this room

1986
01:45:36,439 --> 01:45:44,210
it's very dark if I had dark vision

1987
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:45,949
would that help me at all uh darkened in

1988
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:48,050
that there's not much there either like

1991
01:45:49,579 --> 01:45:54,769
inside there okay okay I have any reason

1992
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:57,020
to believe that Locati

2045
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:22,759
laughing against the back of it from the

2046
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:26,420
inside

2047
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:29,329
um you can see you can see like a stone

2048
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:32,118
circle that you can turn from the inside

2049
01:48:29,328 --> 01:48:33,889
okay like a look at sub yeah yeah Anna

2050
01:48:32,118 --> 01:48:36,109

01:48:33,889 --> 01:48:39,859
you're annihilated okay well I was

2052
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:42,529
getting to violation yeah we were still

2053
01:48:39,859 --> 01:48:44,418
playing down and like literally just the

2054
01:48:42,529 --> 01:48:47,029
two in the denial is

2055
01:48:44,418 --> 01:48:49,069
it's actually two pages and one of it is

2056
01:48:47,029 --> 01:48:50,688
a table of contents you don't mean like

2057
01:48:49,069 --> 01:48:52,038
it sucks it's the other one before work

2058
01:48:50,689 --> 01:48:53,570
so I think I've had it so you can't

2059
01:48:52,038 --> 01:48:56,779
metagame like your players will excuse

2060
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:57,859
no I I have it it's super long um it

2061
01:48:56,779 --> 01:49:00,948
isn't just two pages I promise

2062
01:48:57,859 --> 01:49:02,328
um I promise it it may be really good

2063
01:49:00,948 --> 01:49:04,428
because you're amazing everybody on my

2064
01:49:02,328 --> 01:49:07,908
right now wrote it and even if it was

2065
01:49:04,429 --> 01:49:10,788
two pages it would be amazing so you

2066
01:49:07,908 --> 01:49:13,549
need your the attention to drink I as an

2067
01:49:10,788 --> 01:49:15,918
Android dragon but you'd give it a twist

2068
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:21,498
and then you push it open and then for

2069
01:49:15,918 --> 01:49:25,458
you you can see that this shadow mist is

2070
01:49:21,498 --> 01:49:27,618
just flowing and like once it's like the

2071
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:30,889
pressure changes on the shadow when the

2072
01:49:27,618 --> 01:49:32,929
door opens it just starts to flood in

2073
01:49:30,889 --> 01:49:34,729
it's like it's pulling in even more into

2074
01:49:32,929 --> 01:49:36,649
this central chamber than before but

2075
01:49:34,729 --> 01:49:40,219
when you teleport and Chris yeah Chris

2076
01:49:36,649 --> 01:49:45,679
grout by me that was a lot you're

2077
01:49:40,219 --> 01:49:50,569
actually about three or four feet below

2078
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:54,859
the surrounding floor it is actually

2079
01:49:50,569 --> 01:49:56,958
much lower inside here and low like

2080
01:49:54,859 --> 01:50:00,109
there's a moat okay does it go around

2081
01:49:56,958 --> 01:50:01,908
the room yeah yeah we can tell us that

2082
01:50:00,109 --> 01:50:04,668
it branches out to the left and to the

2083
01:50:01,908 --> 01:50:06,618
right and then continues it forward okay

2084
01:50:04,668 --> 01:50:09,738
how far into the room am i able to see

2085
01:50:06,618 --> 01:50:11,179
now yeah and you the extent of here you

2086
01:50:09,738 --> 01:50:12,918
can actually see the entire thing in

2087
01:50:11,179 --> 01:50:15,529
your vision I mean it's literally only

2088
01:50:12,918 --> 01:50:18,618
like 20 feet this way 20 feet oh okay

2089
01:50:15,529 --> 01:50:23,418
okay let's set that back when I look at

2090
01:50:18,618 --> 01:50:27,708
ya hmm let's draw a picture 20 feet

2091
01:50:23,418 --> 01:50:29,389
display let me beat this way I quickly

2092
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:36,130
jump back into a guy what do they get up

2093
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:39,019
to initial change automatically 'no

2094
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:43,279
dirty adventure let me know you're the

2095
01:50:39,019 --> 01:50:45,860
one saying the words right away boy

2096
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:48,109
Scott oh yeah do I feel like like this

2097
01:50:45,859 --> 01:50:49,969
is a shadow that is my ally or does this

2098
01:50:48,109 --> 01:50:52,969
feel like a rolling kind of shadow yeah

2099
01:50:49,969 --> 01:50:56,659
yeah yeah absolutely this is a this is a

2100
01:50:52,969 --> 01:51:00,100
this is a manipulation

2101
01:50:56,659 --> 01:51:04,880
of the shadows you know this is a deeper

2102
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:07,400
richer truer shadow than you're familiar

2103
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,119
with and it's still awfully fun Brad

2104
01:51:07,399 --> 01:51:11,349
yeah exactly

2105
01:51:08,119 --> 01:51:14,659
Phil it's so silicon philosophical bread

2106
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:17,870
you have light and shadow and then you

2107
01:51:14,659 --> 01:51:20,510
have to contend as a matter of personal

2108
01:51:17,869 --> 01:51:22,430
improvement with this with your shadow

2109
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:26,180
but it's you typically like a

2110
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:28,940
euphemistic interpretation of this these

2111
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:32,090
shadows have their own nature and

2112
01:51:28,939 --> 01:51:35,839
character that seem independent of light

2113
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:37,310
casting they are co-equal it is as

2114
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:43,010
though there was another type of light

2115
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:44,480
hmm and I feel chill with them you don't

2116
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:46,220
you don't you don't hate them you think

2117
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:48,679
they must be related in some way to the

2118
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:50,960
shadows that you have power over okay

2119
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:54,980
but but but as they but as you get

2120
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:57,230
through this threshold and as as you are

2121
01:51:54,979 --> 01:52:01,029
sort of like in the wake of these things

2122
01:51:57,229 --> 01:52:03,349
pushing in you can hear things in them

2123
01:52:01,029 --> 01:52:06,469
but you can hear little voices that

2124
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:08,780
accompany them in sort of in like a it

2125
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:10,940
isn't a cacophony you can pick out

2126
01:52:08,779 --> 01:52:18,380
individual things but it's groups of

2127
01:52:10,939 --> 01:52:23,899
voices and cheers and laughter and the

2128
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:26,029
rolling of dice and the knee is for the

2129
01:52:23,899 --> 01:52:29,000
things like you're hearing like as these

2130
01:52:26,029 --> 01:52:31,849
well as these shadows are flying by you

2131
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:37,239
you're hearing all these moments in them

2132
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:37,240
okay hmm that's odd

2133
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:45,319
so I think the thing to do I'd like to

2134
01:52:42,350 --> 01:52:49,430
do a little just for fun just do a

2135
01:52:45,319 --> 01:52:53,059
little pass about trace on us as a group

2136
01:52:49,430 --> 01:53:00,470
and we will then have plus some bonus

2137
01:52:53,060 --> 01:53:03,830
itself in case it comes to it and I

2138
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:07,360
think I would like to pick the passage

2139
01:53:03,829 --> 01:53:11,260
to the right okay

2140
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:14,859
as everyone entered in yes you rent

2141
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:18,850

the door spins the opposite way and

2153
01:53:51,149 --> 01:53:59,859
seals with a click and it is at that

2154
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:02,020
time that the water level rises from its

2155
01:53:59,859 --> 01:54:05,439
current we're talking about hassling

2156
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:08,500

yeah okay the entire path is like a moat

2166
01:54:27,909 --> 01:54:35,710
and as soon as the door clicks the water

2167
01:54:31,479 --> 01:54:41,859
level in this section begins to rise

2168
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:46,319

casts light through a sort of writhing

2259
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:21,830
twisting it looks like a spinal column

2260
01:59:18,109 --> 01:59:27,848
that's covered in sharp Barb's where the

2261
01:59:21,829 --> 01:59:27,849

we don't breathe this what is this I

2272
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:17,170
didn't build this machine but I do like

2273
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:17,170
it

2274
02:00:18,698 --> 02:00:25,488
can we go back to how it was earlier and

2275
02:00:22,579 --> 02:00:28,640
then you can turn it back on when we

2276
02:00:25,488 --> 02:00:33,198
leave I don't think so I don't know why

2277
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:38,900
I would around the corner the far corner

2278
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:43,428
you see a goblin sort of float upside

2279
02:00:38,899 --> 02:00:47,029
down into view if you look dead quite

2280
02:00:43,429 --> 02:00:49,039
amazing how long a fresh one fresh oh

2281
02:00:47,029 --> 02:00:51,079
okay and you already drowned he's good

2282
02:00:49,039 --> 02:00:53,329
to go out the fresh wine we have like I

2283
02:00:51,079 --> 02:00:57,050
like a breathing apparatus we could

2284
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:59,390
steal no no okay sure those one final

2285
02:00:57,050 --> 02:01:06,770
breath out of me a little one breast

2286
02:00:59,390 --> 02:01:08,989
right so he says sometimes I have to

2287
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:11,540
kill them but I don't like to and

2288
02:01:08,988 --> 02:01:16,729
usually I don't have to if I wait

2289
02:01:11,539 --> 02:01:19,819
they'll stop moving classic scenario oh

2290
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:20,689
yeah like no no judgement we just we

2291
02:01:19,819 --> 02:01:25,670
just don't want to die

2292
02:01:20,689 --> 02:01:26,899
is this yeah oh that we like the machine

2293
02:01:25,670 --> 02:01:30,230
to reason with nothing to knock the

2294
02:01:26,899 --> 02:01:32,779
machine of course you you won't live no

2295
02:01:30,229 --> 02:01:33,738
I mean that which brings us this to our

2296
02:01:32,779 --> 02:01:37,609
previous point about we would like to

2297
02:01:33,738 --> 02:01:40,819
live and if there is there anything that

2298
02:01:37,609 --> 02:01:43,159
can be done so we could live I asked how

2299
02:01:40,819 --> 02:01:46,279
I guess I'm typing you through because

2300
02:01:43,159 --> 02:01:48,170
Veronica yeah III hortie do you hear

2301
02:01:46,279 --> 02:01:50,389
what she had to say just a shadow

2302
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:56,750
I want to hear everybody had no equal

2303
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:59,590
voice try stay calm no I say how many of

2304
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:59,590
them do you require

2305
02:02:00,859 --> 02:02:08,630
required there's there is a whole

2306
02:02:04,039 --> 02:02:12,579
structure full of these more all around

2307
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:15,949
us can you bring them okay absolutely

2308
02:02:12,579 --> 02:02:20,659
littles will they die as these did we

2309
02:02:15,949 --> 02:02:26,059
resume all do you mean yes a delight how

2310
02:02:20,659 --> 02:02:29,680
many can you bring where it's more than

2311
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:36,610
us certainly many more than I was really

2312
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:36,610
really little I would like to see that

2313
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:46,010
just like we all with the voice did calm

2314
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:49,940
the body a woman trying that but I'm

2315
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:54,440
like when we all I have no control over

2316
02:02:49,939 --> 02:02:59,479
it maybe one um died they will come down

2317
02:02:54,439 --> 02:03:00,759
to it's a difficult place to find we

I mean if I was going to be on who I was

2341
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:07,520
going to be why I actually am what I

2342
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:09,369
would do is I would truncate the range

2343
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:14,170
but the range is here very close okay

2344
02:04:09,369 --> 02:04:16,550
mmm-hmm [ __ ]

2345
02:04:14,170 --> 02:04:17,389

know that meetings that would return

2354
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:44,510
Aman I guess is with a worth a question

2355
02:04:41,738 --> 02:04:48,289
and Jim bet would you even consume your

2356
02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:53,860
own death I say this purely out of

2357
02:04:48,289 --> 02:05:01,908
curiosity I consume so many deaths I

2358
02:04:53,859 --> 02:05:05,469

to consume any other way final mmm we're

2362
02:05:21,619 --> 02:05:26,569
gonna get some inception out of this I'm

2363
02:05:23,569 --> 02:05:27,529
going to need some persuasion yeah yeah

2372
02:05:42,529 --> 02:05:46,130
that's worth a question let me first see

2373
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:48,770
if this succeeds and then we'll inquire

2374
02:05:46,130 --> 02:05:51,170
but I'm guessing it huh you can't work

2375
02:05:48,770 --> 02:05:52,850

2399
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:13,250
this way lissa bargaining near the end I

2400
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:16,729
only seek information the machine what

2401
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:21,439
is the machine full of them no I'm your

2402
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:23,509
old yeah yeah oh yeah I know but we're

2403
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:25,460
gonna yeah so like I say it's time the

2404
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:27,739
press so here so here so here you are I

2405
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:30,010
got certain Hartog refer you got shadows

2406
02:07:27,738 --> 02:07:32,238
yeah here's here's your cartography

2407
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:34,400
scenario yeah you've come around this

2408
02:07:32,238 --> 02:07:37,488
corner you can see that it goes up he is

2409
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:39,079
in the next corner up that and then the

2410
02:07:37,488 --> 02:07:41,599
passage continues on to the left past

2411
02:07:39,079 --> 02:07:44,779
him okay no no if we're going to be able

2412
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:48,380
to go over there living it means yeah I

2413
02:07:44,779 --> 02:07:52,069
suspect he will try to eat us if we go

2414
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:53,329
past him uh it's the natural death he

2415
02:07:52,069 --> 02:07:56,299
seems like you're just going to hang out

2416
02:07:53,329 --> 02:07:59,029
until we go all right we can we just

2417
02:07:56,300 --> 02:08:00,680
keep going past in that Bank oh um it's

2418
02:07:59,029 --> 02:08:02,569
an underwater music my hands your okay I

2419
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:04,909
suppose either of you guys are nervous

2420
02:08:02,569 --> 02:08:07,579
we still have half of that trace so we

2421
02:08:04,909 --> 02:08:11,149
could try to sneak past him you

2422
02:08:07,579 --> 02:08:13,448
extinguish your glow man but I don't

2423
02:08:11,149 --> 02:08:15,738
have time I don't know I might need him

2424
02:08:13,448 --> 02:08:18,219
all right I'll just you I would see you

2425
02:08:15,738 --> 02:08:22,459
ago all right Rosina goes first

2426
02:08:18,219 --> 02:08:26,090
she's she swims cautiously you able to

2427
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:29,000
up to this thing no movement and then

2428
02:08:26,090 --> 02:08:31,610
skirts past them I guess I used to swim

2429
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,750
okay you're gonna snap at you okay you

2430
02:08:31,609 --> 02:08:35,679
can get past him but he can see you in a

2431
02:08:32,750 --> 02:08:35,680
snap okay

2432
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:44,800
and he snaps like a pro impatient he

2433
02:08:41,469 --> 02:08:45,939
snaps it like a pro g-man right up laid

2434
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:49,210
on the table first

2435
02:08:45,939 --> 02:08:51,879
14 points want me oh yeah yeah no you

2436
02:08:49,210 --> 02:08:56,140
see anything on that no this justice

2437
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:59,380
hits okay this hits okay yeah he gets

2438
02:08:56,140 --> 02:09:01,090
ahold of your arm and just shakes you

2439
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:03,310
underwater and you're able to pull

2440
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:07,000
yourself away as you round the corner

2441
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:11,909
you can see that much like the door out

2442
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:15,429
front there is another featureless

2443
02:09:11,908 --> 02:09:17,859
partition inside here around the central

2444
02:09:15,429 --> 02:09:21,969
core and you can see that the shadows

2445
02:09:17,859 --> 02:09:24,189
that move in to the front sort of slide

2446
02:09:21,969 --> 02:09:28,060
around maybe there they travel through

2447
02:09:24,189 --> 02:09:30,569
the water and then they go into another

2448
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:33,219
doorway that you can see can I see that

2449
02:09:30,569 --> 02:09:35,769
the thing to know but there is that's

2450
02:09:33,219 --> 02:09:37,539
not visible on this side okay but you do

2451
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:38,860
you have you have shadows you have all

2452
02:09:37,539 --> 02:09:39,550
that you have all the all the tools at

2453
02:09:38,859 --> 02:09:42,279
your disposal

2454
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:43,719
okay let's grab em and see them yeah all

2455
02:09:42,279 --> 02:09:46,119
right so describe this to me

2456
02:09:43,719 --> 02:09:46,899
grandma Mansi is your capacity as we

2457
02:09:46,119 --> 02:09:48,969
describe this want to make sure we're on

2458
02:09:46,899 --> 02:09:50,619
the same page right will you go for it

2459
02:09:48,969 --> 02:09:55,630
just just just crank it up and go well

2460
02:09:50,619 --> 02:09:58,420
okay grandma Mansi allows me to take

2461
02:09:55,630 --> 02:10:01,239
control of and manipulate shadows so I'm

2462
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:03,460
going to I'm going to do at least one

2463
02:10:01,238 --> 02:10:07,238
thing which is reach out to the shadows

2464
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:10,149
that I can see in front of me and push

2465
02:10:07,238 --> 02:10:13,689
them through the cracks in the door and

2466
02:10:10,149 --> 02:10:15,819
up toward what I think is the mechanism

2467
02:10:13,689 --> 02:10:18,309
by which this door will open

2468
02:10:15,819 --> 02:10:19,809
that's very cool on it that's not what I

2469
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:22,750
saw you do have any either that's

2470
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:24,429
awesome does it work yeah totally works

2471
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:28,529
that's amazing okay else we got relief

2472
02:10:24,429 --> 02:10:31,239
or a little water exactly okay so water

2473
02:10:28,529 --> 02:10:34,420
rushes out it's just it's like a fish

2474
02:10:31,238 --> 02:10:36,488
tank yeah breaks in front and in the

2475
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:39,550
three of you are sort of pushed out and

2476
02:10:36,488 --> 02:10:42,039
deposited but this thing has no interest

2477
02:10:39,550 --> 02:10:47,500
in that and water is a natural place for

2478
02:10:42,039 --> 02:10:50,019
it so it's able to keep itself out the

2479
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:52,710
last push of water trending

2480
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:56,050
scooch it out the edge bites onto the

2481
02:10:52,710 --> 02:11:00,609
lip of the door and then Rises its way

2482
02:10:56,050 --> 02:11:07,090
back down the place that you find in the

2483
02:11:00,609 --> 02:11:11,319
center of the half of this power right

2484
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:17,829
jerk yeah the the central column of this

2485
02:11:11,319 --> 02:11:20,500
is spatially distinct from what it

2486
02:11:17,829 --> 02:11:23,739
should be I mean from from your card you

2487
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:27,189
know from your cartographic you know

2488
02:11:23,739 --> 02:11:30,010
scribbling right this should be you know

2489
02:11:27,189 --> 02:11:31,929
yay big it's going to be about 40 feet

2490
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:34,510
on a side okay and it's going to be

2491
02:11:31,930 --> 02:11:36,280
about 20 feet on a side and that's going

2492
02:11:34,510 --> 02:11:40,360
to be the total volume of it that's not

2493
02:11:36,279 --> 02:11:43,929
what it is at all okay now in fact when

2494
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:46,269
you as you pass through this is another

2495
02:11:43,930 --> 02:11:48,520
another physical space and you can see

2496
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:49,780
okay you can see the shadows sort of

2497
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:53,050
traveling they're still there whispers

2498
02:11:49,779 --> 02:11:57,159
these moments of victory and joy that

2499
02:11:53,050 --> 02:11:59,440
are travelling down through them and if

2500
02:11:57,159 --> 02:12:05,430
you emerge it looks like a ruin almost

2501
02:11:59,439 --> 02:12:08,229
like a Greco Rowling type ruin columns

2502
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:11,200
columns are path columns are stood up

2503
02:12:08,229 --> 02:12:13,449
full columns are laid down and snapped

2504
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:17,079
in the middle you know there's just just

2505
02:12:13,449 --> 02:12:20,859
chunks of marble everywhere and in a

2506
02:12:17,079 --> 02:12:23,559
central place beyond these beyond this

2507
02:12:20,859 --> 02:12:24,329
sort of like marble forest on the way to

2508
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:27,430
it

2509
02:12:24,329 --> 02:12:31,300
you can see that you can see a sort of

2510
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:34,060
Plaza that is ringed by these and the

2511
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:37,800
plaza is sort there's a seam along the

2512
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:39,160
middle of this Plaza where implausible

2513
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:44,619
implausible

2514
02:12:39,159 --> 02:12:50,079
this side is has physicality and this

2515
02:12:44,619 --> 02:12:53,140
side is made up of shadow interesting

2516
02:12:50,079 --> 02:13:00,029
and in the center of this plaza you can

2517
02:12:53,140 --> 02:13:07,650
see a decrepit Lizard King

2518
02:13:00,029 --> 02:13:12,949
a just heaped with the finery and marks

2519
02:13:07,649 --> 02:13:18,389
of his station and he is clutching a

2520
02:13:12,949 --> 02:13:22,439
gigantic Jim that is sort of misty gray

2521
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:26,010
and purple and all of the wood no that's

2522
02:13:22,439 --> 02:13:28,079
the thing I know okay Michigan and these

2523
02:13:26,010 --> 02:13:30,449
it I think that's the thing we have to

2524
02:13:28,079 --> 02:13:34,409
rob and these moments these moments of

2525
02:13:30,449 --> 02:13:36,960
joy are flowing out some of these

2526
02:13:34,409 --> 02:13:39,180
moments of joy are going right into this

2527
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:42,960
Jim that he is clutching he looks he

2528
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:48,060
doesn't look alive but he has gripped

2529
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:49,109
around this gym and this shadow energy

2530
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:53,600
is flowing into it

2531
02:13:49,109 --> 02:13:58,519
a portion of it flows up onto the table

2532
02:13:53,600 --> 02:14:03,930
that is positioned between him and a

2533
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:06,750
shadowy version of himself and some of

2534
02:14:03,930 --> 02:14:10,980
some of this shadow stuff is collecting

2535
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:13,890
itself in the form of ships to his right

2536
02:14:10,979 --> 02:14:18,329
and these two appear to be playing a

2537
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:20,190
game down in the core of the dragon's

2538
02:14:18,329 --> 02:14:22,920
hoard what games you may appear to be

2539
02:14:20,189 --> 02:14:24,809
playing um you don't recognize it okay

2540
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:28,250
so when you you don't recognize shadow

2541
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:32,490
version of him he's playing against this

2542
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:34,289
undead just like he have given how is

2543
02:14:32,489 --> 02:14:37,079
this one playing we haven't seen that

2544
02:14:34,289 --> 02:14:41,069
most yeah or is it like his his pieces

2545
02:14:37,079 --> 02:14:44,189
his pieces his dice raise up and our

2546
02:14:41,069 --> 02:14:46,109
role I see it in front of him to his

2547
02:14:44,189 --> 02:14:49,949
right so you've clearly come upon

2548
02:14:46,109 --> 02:14:55,049
something something of a ritual a social

2549
02:14:49,949 --> 02:14:58,739
gathering backgammon club from beyond

2550
02:14:55,050 --> 02:15:03,510
space and time situation sometimes I

2551
02:14:58,739 --> 02:15:09,840
think D&amp;D stood up and then 2 to 2 the

2552
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:13,380
shadow Kings left is a looks to be a

2553
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:14,100
halfling woman with a red cloak with a

2554
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:18,000
black

2555
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:20,220
and around the edge and this cloak goes

2556
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,350
down to about the shoulder and then on

2557
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:24,949
the left side it actually extends far

2558
02:15:22,350 --> 02:15:29,370
down like a full cape and you can see it

2559
02:15:24,949 --> 02:15:33,319
you can see it's silk sort of spill over

2560
02:15:29,369 --> 02:15:35,880
the haft of a sword underneath it

2561
02:15:33,319 --> 02:15:40,289
initiative shadow version corporeal she

2562
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:43,319
is a combination of machine she has

2563
02:15:40,289 --> 02:15:45,239
shadow it by way of this place shadows

2564
02:15:43,319 --> 02:15:52,739
seemed to be very shadows seemed to be

2565
02:15:45,239 --> 02:15:55,010
very concrete comparatively here her

2566
02:15:52,739 --> 02:15:58,319
face even not even underneath the cloak

2567
02:15:55,010 --> 02:16:03,119
you find her face very hard to make out

2568
02:15:58,319 --> 02:16:07,079
it's very sort of polymorphic underneath

2569
02:16:03,119 --> 02:16:09,779
that that's not true for you and it's

2570
02:16:07,079 --> 02:16:12,329
not true for krisstraus oh but you

2571
02:16:09,779 --> 02:16:14,189
cannot make out even underneath this

2572
02:16:12,329 --> 02:16:20,100
part of the cloak like it's just very

2573
02:16:14,189 --> 02:16:24,299
shadowed and to the lizard Kings right

2574
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:31,500
is someone who is speaking sort of in a

2575
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:34,829
low tone to this woman and then he turns

2576
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:38,610
to the lizard king and he says is this

2577
02:16:34,829 --> 02:16:42,989
acceptable my leash and immediately is

2578
02:16:38,610 --> 02:16:46,560
sort of gripped in space lifted up and

2579
02:16:42,989 --> 02:16:51,000
then just flung away you don't even know

2580
02:16:46,559 --> 02:16:52,619
where he goes you have no idea where the

2581
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,690
[ __ ] he went he just when he was in a

2582
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:58,620
catapult that me [ __ ] was want from

2583
02:16:54,690 --> 02:17:03,200
it Wow and this is the scene that you

2584
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:07,020
enter what do we see a nice face okay I

2585
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:08,280
just underneath ya see a woman's chin I

2586
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:10,110
don't know if you guys have ever done on

2587
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:11,370
a riverboat but this is really common

2588
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:12,690
this is how they all are yeah yeah

2589
02:17:11,370 --> 02:17:14,550
Brian's already got this figured out

2590
02:17:12,690 --> 02:17:16,319
when I was a Louisiana it was the same

2591
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:18,179
exact yeah like tomorrow at Disneyland

2592
02:17:16,319 --> 02:17:23,329
yeah exactly

2593
02:17:18,179 --> 02:17:27,389
so John wired so too much treasure whoa

2594
02:17:23,329 --> 02:17:32,389
so the the woman chuckles at this

2595
02:17:27,389 --> 02:17:37,670
a newly airborne intercessor and says

2596
02:17:32,389 --> 02:17:44,430
that's five in one day and she says oh

2597
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:48,000
these must be the replacements indeed

2598
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:55,380
friend we see then friends and never

2599
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:57,290
give up getting different stuff um what

2600
02:17:55,379 --> 02:18:00,059
what have you

2601
02:17:57,290 --> 02:18:02,430
creatures done with the shadow here let

2602
02:18:00,059 --> 02:18:04,920
me catch you up there's the voice from

2603
02:18:02,430 --> 02:18:07,079
beneath the two lizard Kings are not

2604
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:10,170
speaking in the classic sense whatever

2605
02:18:07,079 --> 02:18:13,110
their dialectic is it's connected with

2606
02:18:10,170 --> 02:18:18,379
this game and this energy they're waging

2607
02:18:13,110 --> 02:18:24,390
back and forth right right she says how

2608
02:18:18,379 --> 02:18:27,689
our task is to arrive at a solution for

2609
02:18:24,389 --> 02:18:31,379
a social problem and a metaphysical

2610
02:18:27,690 --> 02:18:39,060
problem simultaneously thus far we have

2611
02:18:31,379 --> 02:18:44,550
been unable to do it this key this only

2612
02:18:39,059 --> 02:18:46,229
take a second this King Anna for 700

2613
02:18:44,550 --> 02:18:50,129
years has been the ruler of his people

2614
02:18:46,229 --> 02:18:53,729
and there is a ritual that they can

2615
02:18:50,129 --> 02:18:57,629
undergo to bring him back to life the

2616
02:18:53,729 --> 02:19:01,709
ritual has ceased to work now due to the

2617
02:18:57,629 --> 02:19:04,769
gracious assistance of my king he has

2618
02:19:01,709 --> 02:19:09,869
been given a system by which he can

2619
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:14,729
retain life but he what the Lizard King

2620
02:19:09,870 --> 02:19:19,610
would like to know is how is the true

2621
02:19:14,729 --> 02:19:24,750
nature of the malady that ails him what

2622
02:19:19,610 --> 02:19:25,890
my king needs is an heir to follow him

2623
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:29,280
to the Shadow Realm

2624
02:19:25,889 --> 02:19:33,539
thus far your king I assume he is the

2625
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:36,570
king of all your people ah details a lot

2626
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:40,599
of people a lot of them certainly thus

2627
02:19:36,569 --> 02:19:46,959
far he has been unwilling to

2628
02:19:40,599 --> 02:19:47,799
a steal accede to this wish we asked for

2629
02:19:46,959 --> 02:19:51,398
one son

2630
02:19:47,799 --> 02:19:54,879
the shadow daughters but the shadow king

2631
02:19:51,398 --> 02:19:57,010
wants the Lizard King to be his heir no

2632
02:19:54,879 --> 02:20:01,209
just provide him he needs one of his

2633
02:19:57,010 --> 02:20:04,380
sons one of his many sons okay so one of

2634
02:20:01,209 --> 02:20:07,389
the Dead Lizard King sons a prince

2635
02:20:04,379 --> 02:20:09,728
perfectly except it would be a shad okay

2636
02:20:07,389 --> 02:20:11,500
okay the problem is that anytime a

2637
02:20:09,728 --> 02:20:14,829
person tries to talk sense to him

2638
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:17,648
he flings him into space it's been a

2639
02:20:14,829 --> 02:20:18,818
challenge for us I see is that where

2640
02:20:17,648 --> 02:20:20,680
that guy went with space we were

2641
02:20:18,818 --> 02:20:23,559
wondering well that's what we call okay

2642
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:27,850
they're like a splat sound when you know

2643
02:20:23,559 --> 02:20:31,809
nothing servers K rockets and there's no

2644
02:20:27,850 --> 02:20:35,800
cartoon and she says it's possible that

2645
02:20:31,809 --> 02:20:39,969
you as the six will be able to talk some

2646
02:20:35,799 --> 02:20:43,090
kind of sense into him he can learn what

2647
02:20:39,969 --> 02:20:47,139
he needs to know we can maintain our

2648
02:20:43,090 --> 02:20:49,270
legitimacy in the shadow Court this just

2649
02:20:47,139 --> 02:20:52,420
seems very straightforward I'm not sure

2650
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:55,859
exactly what the problem is I think that

2651
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:59,770
I it's possible that if we work together

2652
02:20:55,859 --> 02:21:02,710
we can and then immediately behind her

2653
02:20:59,770 --> 02:21:05,079
someone rushes through like Liz like

2654
02:21:02,709 --> 02:21:07,509
like the lizard by the shadow version of

2655
02:21:05,079 --> 02:21:10,539
the lizard Kings the manner putting down

2656
02:21:07,510 --> 02:21:13,260
spears trying to stop this person from

2657
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:16,600
coming in but he is just like in a

2658
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:20,790
dazzling martial display just slicing

2659
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:24,040
spears in half he's kicking people and

2660
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:28,270
he penetrates all of the defenses and

2661
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:33,819
comes up behind this woman that you're

2662
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:39,399
talking to and she her body language

2663
02:21:33,818 --> 02:21:41,228
visibly slumps and she says this has

2664
02:21:39,398 --> 02:21:42,939
happened this happened a couple times

2665
02:21:41,228 --> 02:21:47,500
olá

2666
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:49,989
and she turns around and he says I have

2667
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:52,989
I have I have his name on here I have

2668
02:21:49,989 --> 02:21:55,659
his name no damn it no no no he says he

2669
