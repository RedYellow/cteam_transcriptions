is some kind of vampire coven you are

53
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:39,689

but you were also you also at least

60
00:02:50,699 --> 00:03:01,649
initially held a werewolf at bay Trevor

61
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:08,280
the very same the very same but a rat

62
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:11,759
annoyed walnut was able to sort of calm

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,310
him down to provide a life lesson at a

64
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:18,449
crucial juncture in this young werewolf

65
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:22,650
life and you were able to encourage him

66
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:25,530
to help you defeat a pretty savvy crew

67
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,870
of vampire hunters who were very very

68
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,909
enthusiastic about getting up into this

69
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:35,039
party and murdering all the people that

70
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:39,840
you have been paid to protect now at the

71
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:43,169
end of the adventure you emerged into

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,389
the room here at the last parts of the

73
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:56,000
dregs of this soiree after holding off

74
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:59,489
all manner of unwelcome guests the band

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,229
that was in the corner just entertaining

76
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:05,939
the gathered throng for the evening

77
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:09,449
announced that they had a song that they

78
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:11,568
play at events like these they

79
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:15,509
introduced themselves as acquisitions

80
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:18,659
incorporated and then said death to all

81
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:22,019
vampires and you can only imagine at

82
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,510
this point you can only imagine how I

83
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,740
mean if you were going to match a piece

84
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:28,060
of music to an audience

85
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,819
if you're thinking about it from a

86
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,740
demographics perspective always this is

87
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,590
not going to be the context you deliver

88
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,960
a song called death to all vampires this

89
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,179
is not the venue it's a mismatch it's a

90
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,279
mismatch it's a demographic Nidre engine

91
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,500
really good yeah exactly you gotta Lisa

92
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,959
get police involved if you have to know

93
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,839
your audience it could be a fight

94
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,969
irony like a like a hilarious comment on

95
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,638
like I interpret this yes yeah exactly

96
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,800
yeah you didn't get it yeah yeah it was

97
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,329
Joe it wasn't for today exactly yeah

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,348
that's like classic so we don't Weird Al

99
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:05,469
yeah exactly but so you can you can tell

100
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:07,418
already that the tenor of the room has

101
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,820
been altered slightly for two reasons

102
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:12,639
one this bizarre admission and you can

103
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:16,209
also see that sambar blood drinker has

104
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,788
noticed that slinking in the door to the

105
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:23,019
event space is none other than his

106
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:24,728
cousin Trevor who you know who perhaps

107
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:27,189
feels as though he because he has

108
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:29,879
defended their lives that he might get

109
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:36,939
entree or at least an hors d'oeuvre

110
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:39,120
there bare minimum bare minimum but you

111
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:43,060
only have a moment to process this

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,449
before the song begins in the corner go

very moment what is standing in in a

the hint of a performance a tire you can

tell instantly you recognize the plates

157
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:22,249
the overlapping leather underneath

158
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:24,769
things get bad very quickly great inside

159
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:28,639
you can see this lead singer pulling out

160
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:31,189
hand crossbows making individual shots

161
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,120
and then instead of reloading he just

162
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:40,209
drops it who finds another hand crossbow

163
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:44,539
somewhere within the infinite folds of

164
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:47,419
his garb Reaper yes

165
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:51,939

the base the hand drum the hasty

167
00:08:51,940 --> 00:09:02,690
membrane is torn away beneath it you can

168
00:08:55,309 --> 00:09:04,818
see the symbol of Joaquin coin God flips

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:09,050
it this this individual flips it over

170
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:13,939
from the back comes a hammer right the

00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:17,958
loonie er reaches her hand up into a

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:23,120
tight tasteful bun pulls the pins out

173
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:28,219
and then holds the strings back of the

174
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:31,068
lute a handful of darts fly out into the

175
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,129
room every one of them finds their mark

176
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:37,578
I'm in love with her Josiah very order

but it's very cool you can see the the

186
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:06,560
de Klerk with the shield use this hammer

187
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:09,620
reach he reaches back throws it forward

188
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,289
you see sambar blood drinker yeah take

189
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,139
it in the chest dead center of the chest

190
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:18,409
and two things happen one sambar is

191
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:21,470
driven back through the air through the

192
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:25,068
glass doors that go out to the porch and

193
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:29,240
at the moment the hammer hits it

194
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:32,120
reappears in the hand it's the work this

195
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,110
is bad news the lead singer is now

196
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,990
moving target to target to small claw

197
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:42,409
like knives it's essentially like a

198
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,589
blender elemental I mean imagine imagine

199
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:49,309
the power of a Vitamix turned loose oh

200
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:50,930
yeah the shape of a man that's right I

201
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:53,149
don't let you do whatever whatever more

202
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:55,489
weathera does that have to say whenever

203
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,360
I can react notice which is line it's

204
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,220
time this

205
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,389
instantaneous middle thinks that it's

206
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:04,428
the surprise round we're like oh man

207
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:07,188
socks fantastic I don't think we're

208
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:09,499
going to get teeth is cute

209
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:12,349
I haven't yet they can perform a

210
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:16,369
reaction but we know that when that our

211
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:18,920
patron flew out on the stage that velvet

212
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:22,220
my on camera immediately said about

213
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:24,409
cleaning the blood what a missed one no

214
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,028
no it's just really become and then it's

215
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:28,219
just like it goes the whole trail all

216
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:29,509
the way to the quad I'm imagining that

217
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,360
little cleaning bot from Wally

218
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:35,659
oh no maybe I was exactly that I had

219
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:39,039
exactly the same image that is the that

220
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:44,769
is the scene and then as the last person

221
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:48,649
falls and he turns to you and says

222
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:50,058
you're welcome but this is something

223
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:54,078
very very strange happens but I need to

224
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:58,039
emphasize one other thing any time I

225
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,169
roll a natural 20 or any of the members

226
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,289
of the C team roll and natural 20

227
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:05,238
constantly constantly 24/7 has been the

228
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,368
historical data in combat are always

229
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:10,489
anytime you roll it anytime you write

230
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:12,528
crit then there it is 7/8 what I'm Evan

231
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:15,949
get a 10 to the 20 we are going to do a

232
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:18,168
giveaway in the channel anybody who has

233
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:19,698
been chattin basically the bot is going

234
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:22,039
to go back through the last 15 minutes

235
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:23,628
we're going to grab somebody we've got

236
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,368
some different kinds of stuff got some

237
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,869
coop all got all kinds of stuff we're

238
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:30,110
gonna we're gonna we're going to dish up

239
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:34,189
but but but that is it so as he turns

240
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:37,519
and says derisively do basically you're

241
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:42,078
welcome you're not like a vampire

242
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,980
ologist sure right but I have questions

243
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,448
about how fast everybody went down yeah

244
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,519
you're not a vampire ologist

245
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:52,068
in the classic saying or what I claim

246
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,850
you have exactly exactly

247
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:58,899
you followed some of the hashtags right

248
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:01,399
but yeah you'd have your expectation

249
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:05,119
would be that this scene would look very

250
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:09,769
different if this had been an authentic

251
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:13,009
vampire scenario so are they all

252
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:14,839
hello yes sir just Anacapa yeah I want

253
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:18,589
I've come to a conclusion but I'm just

254
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,420
gonna go up onto it so Trevor hmm is who

255
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,110
I very much like a very real werewolf

256
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:23,360
right

257
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,989
yeah there's you can tell he definitely

258
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,509
a bipedal yes Manuel right but he is he

259
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:32,689
is he is actually kneeled down okay at

260
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:40,808
his cousin and he said you weren't never

261
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:44,360
no vampire I'm gonna just ask this very

262
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:47,928
quietly swole nika's my god

263
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,730
they were LARPing no hawk I said it when

264
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:51,078
the guys first came in when they were

265
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,619
like oh you're defending vampires are

266
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:56,899
gonna remember are they just called it

267
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:58,639
are they yeah so am I looking around

268
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:00,558
he's like the like as The Clash of the

269
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,329
Vale pullback I'm like that's just like

270
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:04,669
Clamato juice they're drinking it's not

271
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:06,558
actual what we think I was just wine

272
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:08,298
with some blood in it oh yeah like a

273
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:09,889
fancy vampire I think for there he was

274
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:10,659
it was weird tasting but it could have

275
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:13,639
been her motto

276
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:16,159
it's weird drink there's a weird drink

277
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,509
it's not a good like only I would rather

278
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,548
drink human blood than Clamato I do your

279
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:25,159
prayer for what if you just if you have

280
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:27,048
to want it like this if you offer me to

281
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:28,249
it's going to be like not the one with

282
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:30,649
the clam yeah

283
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:33,319
please and the auto yeah be positive so

284
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:34,548
hang on so just to recap there were what

285
00:14:33,318 --> 00:14:36,198
I'm going to believe were very real

286
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:37,548
vampire hunters because they sucked to

287
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,798
murder and if they were just LARPers

288
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:41,480
maybe not because we weren't going easy

289
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:42,438
on them right so also thought these

290
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,899
people were vampires

291
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:46,998
right so here we not yes I can you feel

292
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,610
our take away from this is that these

293
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:52,100
LARPers great marketing because word got

294
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,110
out that's true there was a there PR

295
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,678
little too good at their jobs again I'm

296
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,769
campaign but also it's this new badass

297
00:14:57,678 --> 00:15:02,448
elven guy the bands that killed all

298
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,879
these vampires is like you're welcome

299
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:06,168
they're not real vampires dude you just

300
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,759
kill a bunch of innocent people

301
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:10,338
yeah and also we call it a little sex

302
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,959
yeah and it'll John Brant okay well we

303
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,759
probably should say these things to him

304
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,088
yeah I think they all don't character

305
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,149
yes what specifically do you sell i

306
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:23,960
these creatures he's a human is so as

307
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:29,720
you say now the ruse is completely

308
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:33,080
shredded right lead singer yours you

309
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,879
suspect I mean just your instant read is

310
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,009
that this is a person you would have

311
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,588
seen this is a man obviously it would

312
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:41,509
not it would not have he would he

313
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,640
wouldn't have at a place in your Enclave

314
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,740
sure but you can tell that this is

315
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,110
definitely a person who ostensibly

316
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:52,850
Revere's the same natural world that you

317
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:55,600
do he's backed up of course by what you

318
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:59,600
assume from the holy symbol and the

319
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:04,430
accoutrement is a priest of walking and

320
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:08,500
then that most hated of classes the Bard

321
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:13,039
with this war loot in the back hair

322
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:15,519
seeming to still slightly sway in an

323
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,469
invisible breathe clown your water

324
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,299
almost so conflicted it was very

325
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:25,550
challenging for me quite this is IP

326
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:28,909
theft but yeah come back here it did the

327
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:29,599
elf lead singer does he seem small game

328
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:32,838
proud of himself

329
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,540
Oh deeply okay I want to survey the room

330
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,240
and pointedly look very high up in him

331
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:40,849
because I seem taller than me and go you

332
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,740
realize these were definitely not

333
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,550
vampires

334
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:49,850
they were one by the way from vampirism

335
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:51,799
but the y'all aren't we all there's no

336
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,690
vampires here I could very easily just

337
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,179
kill you for the same reason you'd have

338
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,339
a hard time Brittany

339
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:00,649
which one was the vampire what were you

340
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,839
protecting these people from I mean

341
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,730
that's the change that was it that was

342
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,000
imminent yeah they were one bite away

343
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:11,088
but where is the vampire right who's got

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,299
the bike yeah classify baby

345
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:15,980
hey now I was like thanks guys say some

346
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:20,599
like real like puff up her chest yeah

347
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,220
and be like also the legal ramification

348
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,099
of impersonating acquisitions

349
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,970
incorporated it's just and if she sucks

350
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:30,230
all the documentary okay guys slacking

351
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,450
and if you're going to search a nerve

352
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,400
bag like like she has so many documents

353
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,940
for this purpose it's like yes they have

354
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,250
tab it's clearly outlined in our

355
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,450
11-second yeah exactly and she looks

356
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:44,808
anyway listen yeah he says yeah

357
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,960
eventually we realized that our

358
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:52,829
documenter was just getting in the way I

359
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:55,169

363
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:09,808
of a wallet so was it like a bird team

364
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:13,320
on a good day 14 it's a very good day

365
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:16,019

531
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:51,440
you went down and wife exactly so you go

532
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:55,039
down the velvetine ghost that is in your

533
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,539
employ right has since the the front

534
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:02,210
this way a area is looking pretty good

535
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:07,399
as things went to hell you can see the

536
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:12,440
last couple of their sort of shambling

537
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:15,950
servants wiping makeup off their face

538
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,330
and basically beating feet out the back

539
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,580
through what you know to be the lower

540
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:21,649
part of the kitchen right through there

541
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,329
sort of lounge area that has that bar on

542
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,310
the right if you'll recall we got wash

543
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:26,960
more people spaces before starting

544
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:28,909

the ear and then he jumps out the the

736
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:28,739
broken glass of the veranda door and you

737
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:32,289

738
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:34,449
and out into the moonlit field I'm just

739
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:36,670

trying to go a safe place yes and I blow

744
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:49,028
over

745
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:50,618
and at that the notion that he'll be

746
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:53,230
charged additionally from the room music

747
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:58,480
he he loses his old man voice and he

748
00:35:53,230 --> 00:36:02,650
says we were not I assume this isn't

749
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:05,710
this is the room the room fee I will

750
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,608
include the entertainment absolutely I'm

751
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,019
being told

752
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:14,880
two things and it includes so much more

753
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:14,880
if we just charge them too much to leave

754
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,400
a better country yeah yeah use this one

755
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:23,798

756
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,740
just play along but I'm pretending this

757
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:27,969
is like a group call along if we just

758
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:29,078
raise the price so much they'll just be

759
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:35,318
like that's too much trouble and they'll

760
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:37,119
go away all right well it's calling it

761
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,670

00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:11,199
though uh perhaps libations for our

772
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:15,130
forget and and I've instructed velvet to

773
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:17,588
bring a tray oh it's floating myself

774
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:20,710
from the from the kitchen since it's all

775
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:22,328

hahaha just sweating yeah I'm never to

779
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:38,349
do such active no it looks like this is

780
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:40,779
this is the polar opposite of your

781
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:43,779
upbringing is now what I would want to

782
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,820
do this like facade on top of facade

783
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,830
luckily that like plays perfectly with a

784
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,170
murder mystery dinners yeah yeah it's

785
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:52,049
like some somehow conceptually you have

786
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,909
like drilled into the ultimate

787
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,370
manifestations yeah yeah II love this

788
00:37:54,909 --> 00:38:00,699
sweaty proprietor yeah the idea that

789
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:03,509
like people do this like an additional

790
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:07,809
layer of lies on top of reality

791
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,230
responded I miss exactly that's okay

792
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:10,449
great

793
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:15,369
so you've instructed the the velvetine

794
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:15,939
spirit to secure spirits where ever you

795
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,159
got back there

796
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,039
from the yet there they're plentiful

797
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:24,879
there's also as I suggested a small bar

798
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,139
actually out in the open area okay so it

799
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,010
was something to consider but we'll see

800
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:32,589
we'll see where that goes but but he he

801
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:36,030
is he is ready he is he is weary from

802
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:38,740
the road you suspect that their task

803
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:41,530
involves a lot of driving and nothing

804
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:42,579
happening most of the time but he he

805
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,620
seems very familiar with the

806
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:46,480
surroundings I mean you think he might

807
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:48,250
have been to the doone-gate in yeah a

808
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,579
couple times it's only open late at

809
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:55,480
night as you know from the gate right

810
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:57,940
and there's nowhere that can like all of

811
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,590
the rooms are upstairs or where the

812
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:03,550
bodies are we have to go past there in

813
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:05,410
order to see so remember main set of

814
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,410
stairs up front

815
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:10,629
venue right there are two more sets of

816
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:13,480
stairs that come from the front that go

817
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:15,700
around and have room access on the sides

818
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,070
of the lycée so they can avoid that that

819
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:19,839
there there's two there's two dining or

820
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,590
there's two routes that go up there and

821
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:27,340
then of course the lobby lounge zone is

822
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:28,769
down there in that central area via the

823
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,000
morgue

824
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:33,190
guys are we doing a murder mystery or

825
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,599
not they really want us doing this is

826
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,789
this a bit I don't know we really like

827
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:38,309
gonna improv an entire murder mystery to

828
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:40,349
distract some cops

829
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,340
I just want to get drunk to the point

830
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:46,349

lot or whatever the name was no so you

00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:57,419
can see so the day of they have been to

835
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,969
they've begun to try to figure out who

836
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,139
they are in this context yeah you know

837
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:02,789

838
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:06,690

right the the one that had been at the

841
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:16,769
end of the column who appears to have

842
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:19,650
the greatest enthusiasm for this

843
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:22,289
construct you've generated it's

844
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:25,039
constantly he has a monocle he places it

845
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:28,170
in his eye and he says who I say Oh

846
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,719
keeps doing it who is all my friends

847
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:33,659
right no no no matter they all did yeah

848
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:37,829
no matter what is it he sees like a set

849
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:40,649
he or a Shazz lounge book okay he's just

850
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:45,389
he's maximizing it I am I couldn't agree

851
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:47,789
more person yeah hey I I want to I'm

852
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:49,799
going to take the guards or their

853
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:51,449
captain a guard over and I'm going to

854
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,700
start explaining to him mostly to like

855
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,139
what the party at this point for yeah

856
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:57,929
not at this point

857
00:40:55,139 --> 00:41:01,379
at this point the the rest of the guards

858
00:40:57,929 --> 00:41:06,049
are having been given the okay to dress

859
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:11,519
in funny costumes they are now orbiting

860
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:13,350
the velvetine spirit like mods yeah

861
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,530
getting that beverages around it around

862
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:22,679
this bottle and there is there is a

863
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:26,910
point very near to the their initial

864
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:28,649
beverage activations that they forego

865
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:31,349
the glasses altogether

866
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:33,539
yeah and it's purely it's just bottle

867
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:37,559
yeah it's just bottle it's just bottle

868
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:41,309
they set the empty bottle down on the

869
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:46,289
edge and then it teeters and then the

870
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:51,630
velvetine spirit adjust and then toddles

871
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:53,130
back floats back sails back

872
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,260
whatever yeah you can't see them either

873
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,599
it's friction-free what are you doing

874
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,260
it's all fiction free so this they're

875
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:05,009
going to work now we have Lord Baron

876
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:07,800
Winkle stuff but he's lost his character

877
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:14,390
a little bit okay um he there was a

878
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:19,830
mercenary aspect that sort of crept in

879
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:20,609
when dinar came and tried to turn the

880
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:25,469
screws

881
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:27,599
yeah um quiet shallow my [ __ ] on my

882
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:30,179
friend can be a little coarse around the

883
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,829
edges but I've brought you into this

884
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:36,379
room for a reason and I look around make

885
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:40,349
sure nobody can listen I think that you

886
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:42,750
should play the relative murderer now

887
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:45,569
this is a secret role and it is a lot of

888
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,170
responsibility I think you might enjoy

889
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,809
it

890
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:51,900
I've seen men like you do very very well

891
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:54,090
in these roles what do you say

892
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,680
it's like generally speaking you know if

893
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,570
you were to say something that increased

894
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,429
a person's confidence their posture

895
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:02,100
would improve right right but because

896
00:42:59,429 --> 00:43:07,219
this specifically requires that he

897
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:11,339
hundred you will in Italy he wilts in a

898
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:14,309
practiced careful way and anything he

899
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:18,780
says what do you require for he yeah you

900
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:20,340
ever the only requirements of this rule

901
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,950
I'm sorry gonna terms Duma creepy voice

902
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:25,800
is that you never reveal that you want

903
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:31,319
to murder her but you know in your heart

904
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:35,430

00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:46,809
it all the meal scream like that scene

930
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,720
in Super Troopers whether they have to

931
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:52,749

00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:53,858
so you're able to eat for probable if

00:44:52,748 --> 00:44:57,189
you're going to eat all of these

934
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:58,900
murdered pseudo vampires at Yugi sure

935
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:02,289
so here's what I am doing while they're

936
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:05,950
doing this is that I want to close the

937
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:07,989
area off and then I want to just put

938
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:09,098
like a chair or something like I was

939
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:10,239
want to pile some stuff together so that

940
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:12,369
there would be some resistance if they

941
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:14,619
tried to do it yeah you want to make you

942
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:16,480
want to take this room off the menu I

943
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:19,390
want to take it off the menu and then if

944
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,190
I have any extra time I would also like

945
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:22,989
to maybe a rink because they're like in

946
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:27,369
the venue area is near where the

947
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:29,159
fountain is right only out is exactly

948
00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:32,650
right it's in the hallway just outside

949
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:35,379
the doors interesting okay well then I

950
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,509
want to just kind of like arrange these

951
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,249
people so that maybe it kind of looks

952
00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:42,429
like ritualistic or something like that

953
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:44,259
like this is some like wow I was just

954
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:45,879
going to lead them into the really good

955
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:47,230
people but yeah I was just going to let

956
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,269
them feel like they were just like

957
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:50,559
makeup like safe dead people

958
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:52,659
oh that's fine too I decide for later

959
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,579
when people find these oh well that's

960
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:56,048
like yeah and so there's like and they

961
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:59,580
feel like everybody that could have a

962
00:45:56,048 --> 00:46:05,550
cup has a cup and then like

963
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:07,960
so it looks like the urine but

964
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,340
elaborately I string them up like you

965
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,650
know we can refer knees kind of thing I

966
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,269
believe right the killer wouldn't do

967
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:16,360
that killer would arrange them in a semi

968
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:18,880
yeah because I wouldn't what does Jen

969
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,400
are doing besides trying to extract gold

970
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,289
for everyone yeah I was just trying to

971
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,460
get the cops to go away now the new plan

972
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:26,409
is to get them blitz

973
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,909

you deeply so from outside you can hear

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,930
yeah we're going to create you to

1096
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:11,010
recreate your door scenario on the other

1097
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:13,169
side and it as the as you're closing the

1098
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:15,359
door the guard captain just stops dead

1099
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,400
in his tracks then you see him look back

1100
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:20,460
through the crack of the door and then

1101
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:26,338
you shut it and lock it yeah like who

1102
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:29,338
did it no no no good question okay run

1103
00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:30,119
okay let's grab we get back to a car

1104
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:32,068
yeah yeah yeah

1105
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,079
good all right I run over to their cart

1106
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:37,679
and I smash the wheel all very nice

1107
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:41,380
a little official strength disease I

1108
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:44,409
think drinks know it under strong boy

1109
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:50,140
Lex hey that's a 1 that's a 1 I do got

1110
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:52,268
my philosophy can you go over and it's

1111
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:55,449
like you have the plan in your head and

1112
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:58,268
then you go over and you just kick it as

1113
00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:59,768
hard as you can and you hit it wrong so

1114
00:52:58,268 --> 00:53:02,558
there's like on the top of the toe and

1115
00:52:59,768 --> 00:53:03,758
just oh so you see the nurse for the hop

1116
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:08,019
around on one foot

1117
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:09,429
how when you roll a real one the viewers

1118
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,248
have to give us something yeah exactly

1119
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:14,018
you don't give them something yeah yeah

1120
00:53:11,248 --> 00:53:17,498
yeah yeah what a pity well you become

1121
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:19,088
icy Denar fail miserably at picking I

1122
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:21,159
run up and I kick the wheel too just so

1123
00:53:19,088 --> 00:53:22,150
you don't feel bad good I think that's

1124
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:24,308
what mean it's getting away we can

1125
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,959
attach this cart without great text I

1126
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:28,528
guess right let's just go fast

1127
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:36,009
no is it horse can I kill the horse Wow

1128
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:40,989
what oh not anymore it doesn't it was

1129
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:43,748
all ours I was good so you you you see

1130
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:45,159
it now I didn't use a horse so kind of

1131
00:53:43,748 --> 00:53:48,399
let the horse run away it's late it's

1132
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:51,278
too late it's you're inspired by walnut

1133
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,459
yeah I'm trying to make friends watch it

1134
00:53:51,278 --> 00:53:56,099
this is what you like right little bit

1135
00:53:54,458 --> 00:54:00,338
did I do good

1136
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:02,890
did I did mommy so no what happens is

1137
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:05,170
that is it Hebrew he brings the sword

1138
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:07,179
down yeah and you think for a second

1139
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:09,369
that he's trying just to like make two

1140
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:13,239
or stews as Christ that's a real hunger

1141
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:16,749
games are trying to make two horses but

1142
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:18,759
it comes down right on the strap and the

1143
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:20,439
rest of the the mechanism that is

1144
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:24,630
holding the horse oh you mean it's fine

1145
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:27,759
no no the mechanism finally on a special

1146
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:30,278
exact dates rather the lesser the lesser

1147
00:54:27,759 --> 00:54:33,130
horse part and it did is off like a bull

1148
00:54:30,278 --> 00:54:34,659
yeah like imagine imagine imagine an

1149
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,699
alternate version of this universe where

1150
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:39,998
they had invented something like a horse

1151
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:42,729
cannon then fiery it's like that like

1152
00:54:39,998 --> 00:54:44,348
the horse of just yeah that's a good

1153
00:54:42,728 --> 00:54:45,548
horse out into the night yeah we could

1154
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:47,620
have used that horse probably better

1155
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:50,000
than the wheel couldn't

1156
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:52,429
chorionic spit this is what occurs to

1157
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,550
you and as you see it you know first

1158
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:57,559
sort of dappled in silver yeah and then

1159
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,870
I get our shitty horses and I was like

1160
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:01,699
yeah yeah coriander sort of absently

1161
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:04,190
chewing is there anything cool in their

1162
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:06,559
cart shoeing resentfully their cart no

1163
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,940
this is this is means you you think that

1164
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,759
they may come across things on occasion

1165
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:13,280
and carpenters um but no no this their

1166
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,080
school in the car no there's nothing to

1167
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,250
nothing back there in the cart it's I

1168
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:18,259
mean it's a pretty like I say it's a

1169
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,570
pretty rough it's a pretty rebel vehicle

1170
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:23,290
but yeah he is I couldn't got my sword

1171
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:26,269
like it feels just for a fact crystals

1172
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:28,969
hanging from the back anyway I'm on top

1173
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:31,369
of our car and I won't have used enhance

1174
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:33,139
ability again to make coriander really

1175
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:36,440
fast I hold her back I'm going to let's

1176
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:38,629
go yeah get in the look get it rip no

1177
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:42,320
coriander and in the width exactly

1178
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:44,599
I also enter is a quick quick

1179
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,750
I guess standard position yet core and

1180
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:51,199
coriander remembers any business to get

1181
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:53,690
that ancient bigger yes um that you know

1182
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:56,119
that good very exactly the best berry

1183
00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:00,829
right this is like level five good

1184
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:02,150
mission right it's um it's Odwalla yeah

1185
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:04,730
right woo

1186
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:07,789
let's get the protein that is exactly

1187
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:11,929
what happens yeah back the cart down the

1188
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:14,690
trail head down to the long road and

1189
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:16,279
beat then start your way north the

1190
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:18,500
Thunder is scaring the [ __ ] out of ya

1191
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,030
it's very spooky in here or the Mike's

1192
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,030
picking it up though yeah right now it's

1193
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:25,340
physics if they are hungry oh there it's

1194
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:28,700
basically striking the building a shake

1195
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:30,890
on with with the weight anyway yeah yes

1196
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:33,109
it yeah whatever I'll talk about that no

1197
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:34,670
okay um if they start to pursue it

1198
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:37,400
they're probably going to pursue it on

1199
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:39,769
the long road are there any like little

1200
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,110
side roads that we see that I can

1201
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:43,880
cartographers our way through I love

1202
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,530
everything about this ready let's yeah

1203
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,809
but let's see what you got okay what

1204
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:50,120
would you like me to roll in that I a

1205
00:56:47,809 --> 00:56:54,650
market offer guys don't worry about it

1206
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:56,480
I told of it well that doesn't a great

1207
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:59,539
Victor I believe I'm saying no but still

1208
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,170
there you get for though for now for now

1209
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:04,048
I'm going to say that

1210
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:05,450
that star for Rosie's if you have time

1211
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:08,608
for Rosie

1212
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:12,750
geography is in a historical all right

1213
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:16,528
context sir 20q all right that's real

1214
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:20,599
good put on yeah you know you know for

1215
00:57:16,528 --> 00:57:22,949
about 20 to 30 days yeah yeah NAT 20

1216
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:26,099
that's if it's on delayed reaction it's

1217
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:30,210
only his eighth game Dungeons and

1218
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:35,338
Dragons now yeah you know that you know

1219
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:37,470
that in this in this part of the long

1220
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:41,038
road to the east of it you know that

1221
00:57:37,469 --> 00:57:46,318
there are some older trails in the

1222
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:47,329
summer hills that were once like mines

1223
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,739
that didn't pan out

1224
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:52,260
lots of old work trails I mean they're

1225
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:54,028
somewhat overgrown now but you think

1226
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,130
that you should be able to obviously

1227
00:57:54,028 --> 00:57:58,199
take longer getting home but you think

1228
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:00,450
that you'll be able to probably work

1229
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:02,639
that since were the only people at the

1230
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:04,858
scene of a massacre yeah exactly so

1231
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,828
these all this the situation is

1232
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:10,759
basically just this sort of tangled knot

1233
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:13,470
of trails that surround these mounds

1234
00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:16,079
similar the ones that you saw to the

1235
00:58:13,469 --> 00:58:19,500
north when you were on the Stone Road

1236
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:23,730
okay when you stopped the rates right

1237
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:27,659
okay so I climb on top and I sit from -

1238
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:29,940
you like that even oh look this bump yes

1239
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:31,649
like get those reins from you and I

1240
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,829
start at solicit Vera's off the roads

1241
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:36,480
and we start to wind through the woods

1242
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:38,039
surrounding these like it's that like

1243
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,039
scene for me Center when he's walking in

1244
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:43,470
the car yeah how come here yeah yeah

1245
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:47,039
keep it coming keep it coming

1246
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:51,048
yeah so so as you as you pull off the

1247
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:55,528
the beaten path and onto these more

1248
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:58,349
ancient roads you often that often the

1249
00:58:55,528 --> 00:59:01,679
distance just in the dark surrounding

1250
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:05,400
the the trail you see tiny wisps of

1251
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:07,318
green flame so you know to be this is

1252
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:12,019
just that this is this is how creatures

1253
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:13,980
communicate okay I think it's very I

1254
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:14,639
don't think it Muriel you think I

1255
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,949
probably

1256
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,170
like fire fire yeah okay pretty though

1257
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:20,699
no no it's tasteful because on fire

1258
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:22,259
because this is because this is this is

1259
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:25,230
this is vitally important

1260
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:27,989
you have forgone the long road for

1261
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:31,019
protection right and have instead taken

1262
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:34,259
these ancient roads that are literally

1263
00:59:31,018 --> 00:59:37,008
artifacts of humankind's failure to

1264
00:59:34,259 --> 00:59:39,809
derive any value from these places it is

1265
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:42,869
incredibly dark okay

1266
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:44,369
um so you guys all have dark vision

1267
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:44,849
right yeah oh you're not you're not too

1268
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:47,249
bothered

1269
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:49,259
that's why trust me I'm the only one I'm

1270
00:59:47,248 --> 00:59:53,998
like what's going on out there I also

1271
00:59:49,259 --> 00:59:56,309
have a fire it's just yeah black figure

1272
00:59:53,998 --> 00:59:58,169
I mean I'm snapping them and it looks

1273
00:59:56,309 --> 01:00:00,569
painted over I could we could we could

1274
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:02,970
possible ice and ground effect than what

1275
01:00:00,568 --> 01:00:05,880
I thought that's truly been to are you

1276
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:08,159
go so grounded Patrick's element okay I

1277
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,960
can say yeah go get ready it's so do you

1278
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:12,088
castes in life or is it just part of our

1279
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,949
car notes are the cards it's an

1280
01:00:12,088 --> 01:00:16,650
aftermarket if you want regards easily

1281
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:18,179
usable light weather can we see with the

1282
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:20,970
ground effects is it casting any weight

1283
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:22,798
it's it's not a suit it isn't an

1284
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:24,899
incredible distance but it's a little

1285
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:26,579
bit more comforting yeah so you guys all

1286
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,829
have dark vision I can cast our vision

1287
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:32,039
but do you want to take a peek around

1288
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:34,369
maybe and see what you see yeah why not

1289
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,720
yeah boy one timer I'd love to do that

1290
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:40,380
yeah you got the good awesome

1291
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:43,618
no I go to sleep before you you're like

01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:46,710
I'm gonna go you fall asleep on Bernard

1293
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:48,930
yeah it's just like cordwood spoon yeah

1294
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:51,539
we argue over who is a little spoon for

1295
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:54,149
a minute right but I'm like I'm the

1296
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:59,390
division it I'm a little fun um I got in

1297
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:00,900
nine but I'm wondering if I don't know

1298
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:04,139
let's have it

1299
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:06,180
Oh actually I don't want to just read on

1300
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:08,699
top I'd actually also like I'd like to

1301
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:12,629
turn into my wolf form and run along

1302
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:14,879
behind the cart because I am concerned

1303
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:16,200
about our tracks and I want to make it

1304
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,420
look like maybe we went down here cuz we

1305
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:19,558
were being pursued by something and then

1306
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,759
also just in case there's anything out

1307
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:22,829
here because you're kind of setting up

1308
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:25,949
we didn't just get all the way home yeah

1309
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:27,568
yeah yeah we have the silent running

1310
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:29,848
we do we also have the one need oh hi

1311
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:31,889
drive then we have the one that let me

1312
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:33,449
see the all around the car yeah I could

1313
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:35,400
have all those things going that's cool

1314
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:37,559
on the raise up and I also want to just

1315
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,568
run behind the curtain okay also in the

1316
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:43,349
mobile thing although I guys well just

1317
01:01:39,568 --> 01:01:45,630
don't chain meows whoa whoa no no okay I

1318
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:48,539
lower my wall for no it's wolf nut will

1319
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:50,039
snap up nut both note down grass so yeah

1320
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:51,809
you know we installed one of those

1321
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,180
modules at a time of course so you can

1322
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:56,099
have that you can either have the

1323
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:59,969
observation owl but you can have the

1324
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:01,499
silent running cat so let's not even up

1325
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:03,208
to you observation I don't think we're

1326
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:06,509
going to see anything additional through

1327
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:07,528
it so to dark Sally right yeah I mean if

1328
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:09,568
we're worried about being pursued

1329
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:11,190
silence sounds pretty good on silence

1330
01:02:09,568 --> 01:02:14,308
like we can do that and ground effects

1331
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:15,719
and dancing like the dancing lights on

1332
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:17,219
one of these a pompous at the comic

1333
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:20,639
exactly where this thing only it does

1334
01:02:17,219 --> 01:02:23,880
sound yeah we'll see if anybody sees

1335
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,920
I'll see a soundless yeah light sound of

1336
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:32,548
Marty got ya on wheel we have to make

1337
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:34,619
ghost noises I'm looking here you have

1338
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:36,690
to run behind outside of the field of

1339
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:40,380
silent that's fine yeah it goes wolfson

1340
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:42,088
yeah ghosty Wolfie home yeah yeah okay

1341
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,509
you're doing this yeah we'll do the

1342
01:02:42,088 --> 01:02:47,759
soundless okay attachment the cat yeah

1343
01:02:44,509 --> 01:02:51,708
yeah yeah so even even to your it's a

1344
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:55,670
little uncanny as a Dino

1345
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:58,858
virtually perfected pack predator

1346
01:02:55,670 --> 01:03:02,789
walking right along syntax exactly but

1347
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:05,759
the it's okay but the pain in the

1348
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:09,630
padding of your paw on the ground is

1349
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:13,528
louder than the cart good nice they want

1350
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:15,298
to mess with us I can go get it but it

1351
01:03:13,528 --> 01:03:19,469
also I would love to get a perception

1352
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:26,929
role from a good I really worry Betty

1353
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:30,088
calm uh yeah yeah eighteen you feel

1354
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:33,719
dressed like straight through your your

1355
01:03:30,088 --> 01:03:38,420
paws as the every time they connect with

1356
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:40,039
the ground you feel you feel a vibration

1357
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:42,220
no it's

1358
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:46,340
honestly it reminds you good good good

1359
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:50,469
vibrations um but like Brian Wilson it

1360
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:53,090
reminds you it reminds you of onyx oh

1361
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:56,689
yeah okay that that's sort of like

1362
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:59,150
all-encompassing but the earth is moving

1363
01:03:56,690 --> 01:04:01,940
okay basically but it right right now

1364
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:09,740
it's like if it does require a conscious

1365
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:10,730
effort to keep track of it okay well I'm

1366
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:14,929
just gonna keep to myself because I

1367
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:19,659
can't say anything yes my friend how I

1368
01:04:14,929 --> 01:04:25,039
kept conscious effort um Rosie

1369
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:27,079
your understanding of this of this

1370
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:30,590
environment back here

1371
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:32,809
there should be a fork north okay I'm

1372
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:35,870
very very soon I would like to get some

1373
01:04:32,809 --> 01:04:39,789
more history from you just to maintain

1374
01:04:35,869 --> 01:04:43,639
this that's not eleven trajectory you

1375
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:48,079
think you might have missed it oh you

1376
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:52,039
might have missed the the North Fork and

1377
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:55,549
are now sort of seeking the next path in

1378
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:57,469
that direction to maintain the time but

1379
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:58,010
you think you may have you think you may

1380
01:04:57,469 --> 01:05:00,619
have lost

1381
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:02,210
what's your time right now well right

1382
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:05,150
now it's sort of in a northeasterly

1383
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:07,460
direction it's through this it's

1384
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:09,019
basically you're so you're going on

1385
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,510
these paths that are around these

1386
01:05:09,019 --> 01:05:12,920
ancient mounds okay that as you're going

1387
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:15,440
north do I know anything about the each

1388
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,349
amount people have a lot of theories

1389
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,179
about what they are that tends to be

1390
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:22,339
culturally informed okay Giants think

1391
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:23,989
something specific some people just

1392
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:26,840
believe what the Giants believe when I

1393
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:30,319
explain which is that badly that they

1394
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:32,510
are really really big nice they're just

1395
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:35,030
really really big yeah there's not

1396
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:36,020
there's not much here like here where

1397
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:40,070
the Giants believe that sounded like

1398
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:41,480
that they think that that their kin

1399
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:44,120
they're right they think that their

1400
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:46,300
ancient kin are buried here so there was

1401
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:51,440
a period there's a period of time where

1402
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:53,359
they were even greater that the giant

1403
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,869
kind today

1404
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:58,460
is smaller than their ancient kin but

1405
01:05:56,869 --> 01:06:00,619
there was a period of time where you

1406
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:06,199
know this this whole this whole land was

1407
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:09,710
their ritual grave okay so this could be

1408
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:11,239
a giant graveyard and you are starting

1409
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:15,230
to feel vibrations that you can't

1410
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:17,749
communicate to us okay all right but we

1411
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:18,259
don't worry about that yeah yeah that's

1412
01:06:17,748 --> 01:06:20,328
fine

1413
01:06:18,259 --> 01:06:22,849
the priest is a huge plus I'm recharging

1414
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:24,829
Rosie Rosie knows this about the giant I

1415
01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:26,329
think it yeah these are these are not

1416
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:27,980
weird story okay all right

1417
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:30,528
there's nothing crazy about this okay

1418
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:33,519
well I don't feel what what what's doing

1419
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:36,469
but just seeing those mounds and and

1420
01:06:33,518 --> 01:06:38,629
remembering those tales yeah you can you

1421
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:40,338
know you missed it I know I missed it

1422
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:41,778
I'm a little bit so I'm gonna pass about

1423
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:44,088
trace now I'm actually going to make us

1424
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:45,858
like even more difficult to see or find

1425
01:06:44,088 --> 01:06:48,858
because I don't know where the [ __ ] we

1426
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:51,739
are and I don't trust that we are in

1427
01:06:48,858 --> 01:06:54,078
good space at the moment okay so we papa

1428
01:06:51,739 --> 01:06:55,639
trace which means the old shadows

1429
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,609
silence radiates from you masking you go

1430
01:06:55,639 --> 01:07:00,768
in Danian you you you each have a 10

1431
01:06:58,608 --> 01:07:02,598
plus 10 bonus to dexterity self checks

1432
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:05,179
and you can't be tracked except by

1433
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:07,278
magical means and we leave behind their

1434
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:09,348
tracks around the trees super engaging

1435
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:13,579
demon initially I adjudicated that dress

1436
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:15,950
not at a high percent accuracy but my

1437
01:07:13,579 --> 01:07:18,769
reading of it sort of implied that you

1438
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:20,328
were the cloak of shadows and made you

1439
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:22,488
impossibly difficult to see right there

1440
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:24,440
it's really about being trapped right it

1441
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:27,019
isn't about being to be able to hide

1442
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,999
like in plain sight right so I think

1443
01:07:27,018 --> 01:07:30,979
that I edited judicata that incorrectly

1444
01:07:28,998 --> 01:07:32,419
so just a lot to keep that exactly at

1445
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,019
the very beginning just so just keep

1446
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:37,608
that in mind

1447
01:07:33,018 --> 01:07:43,399
so wolf not hmm

1448
01:07:37,608 --> 01:07:47,150
I need more perception from you know

1449
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:50,838
closed 24 oh it was almost yeah timing

1450
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:55,460
already give away wings all right you

1451
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:58,278
hear in the distance it's almost at a

1452
01:07:55,460 --> 01:08:00,769
similar resonance to to feeling of the

1453
01:07:58,278 --> 01:08:06,278
ground the vibration seems to increase

1454
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:06,278
as you hear it almost sounds like Horn

1455
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:13,079
you're not sure that it is a horn but it

1456
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:15,149
has it has a most like tonal musical

1457
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:20,760
quality put that like an Alpine horn

1458
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:22,159
like I see use like like yeah yeah this

1459
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,590
episode's sponsored by recollection

1460
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:29,159
that's right

1461
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:33,390
environment um ok great so at this point

1462
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:36,090
I want to pull up like run alongside and

1463
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:38,460

look ahead of them you can see okay

1492
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:52,679
whenever I can look for more absolutely

1493
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:54,890
you the night air is activating

1494
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:57,060
everything that you like about Wolf hood

1495
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:59,010
this is something like this is this is

1496
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:02,640
it like this is this is what you were

1497
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:06,210
meant to do and as you as you sort of

1498
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:11,760
lope out ahead of the cart you can see

1499
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:16,350
in the distance the moonlight is casting

1500
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:19,470
along the edge of one of these one of

1501
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:26,490
the hills in the summer hills you see

1502
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:31,340
like a burst of earth okay great

1503
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:35,429
that puffs out and as it as it erupts

1504
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:39,960
the sounds that you heard increases in

1505
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:43,200

like let's just keep going are we

1510
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:56,310
heading toward that verse that you

1511
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,500
thought is it like directly yeah but I'm

1512
01:10:56,310 --> 01:11:01,800
a straight ahead into the left yeah okay

1513
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:04,739
do I see it as well yeah yeah this at

1514
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,300
this point you see it authentically you

1515
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:08,069
don't see but you don't see creatures or

1516
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:11,699
anything like that like nothing nothing

1517
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:14,759
except for the earth and this sound

1518
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:16,369
strange sound and then as that happens

1519
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:21,060
the vibration ceases

1520
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:22,979
well not I'm gonna keep going I'm at

1521
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:28,440
like I keep driving but I'm like walnut

1522
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:31,529
all right mmm that's the scent you can't

1523
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:32,099
place then I'm gonna peel off from them

1524
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:33,989
okay

1525
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,390

cake now make damn banana in Rome I'm

1528
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:42,329
going to pull around to the left I must

1529
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:44,639
slow down okay I'm just going to keep an

1530
01:11:42,329 --> 01:11:46,829
eye on you okay I want to go inspect

1531
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,730
what the party's mouth that's good yeah

1532
01:11:46,829 --> 01:11:52,739
yeah this is a dive into the pit weight

1533
01:11:50,729 --> 01:11:56,579
in the head yeah it is it's challenging

1534
01:11:52,739 --> 01:12:01,289
to it's challenging to place it it is an

1535
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:09,350
ancient but notice ancient earth it is

1536
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:10,500
the it is the old stone it is no prey oh

1537
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:13,110
okay

1538
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:18,180
yeah um and then as you get closer to

1539
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:20,609
the door you see that this floor so as

1540
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:23,610
you guys you get closer to what is

1541
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:28,199
clearly the entrance of something

1542
01:12:23,609 --> 01:12:32,099
subterranean almost just dis gorged from

1543
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:33,059
it in front of it may be as a result of

1544
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:43,380
the burst

1545
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:46,080
is our bones clothes and a staff okay

1546
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:50,069
all right telling us that this is

1547
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:56,760
normally it is a training staff that's

1548
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:59,670
very similar to Rosie's okay okay so if

1549
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,110
I can get closer to the the door and

1550
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:02,699
just do a perception check on like

1551
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:06,500
what's immediately here is really kind

1552
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:06,500

exactly there you know and I'm waking up

1592
01:14:56,979 --> 01:15:03,399
it's like Darwin ah yes I mean it gives

1593
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:07,449
you wings so say say so you so you've

1594
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:10,929
helped your compatriots a groggy dinar

1595
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:13,319
Blitzen is sort of half-heartedly yeah

1596
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:16,780
there's no look like home

1597
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:19,899

hmm

1600
01:15:21,369 --> 01:15:27,640
you can see like I say it's just like

1601
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:32,230
the it's the rags that are clinging to

1602
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:34,720
these skeletons and I guess a so they

1603
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:39,639
have various various types of equipment

1604
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:42,940
with them you can see that like swords

1605
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:45,460
that are corroded down to the hilt you

1606
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:48,159
can see you can see just like down to

1607
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:51,430
the wood handles but all but the blades

commercials featuring dinar but no no

1632
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:05,000
you see it you see it as a as a stair

1633
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:10,310
that goes down their alcove with sort of

1634
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:16,340
emerald almost green flame in alcoves

1635
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:18,440

1636
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:22,430
right continue on can I take a look at

1637
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:29,539
that staff yeah you can visit better

1638
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:32,750
than mine can you guys fight a little

1639
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:34,789
bit yeah we're talking I'm gonna do it

1640
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:37,250
like yes good girl good but then you

1641
01:17:34,789 --> 01:17:42,159
actually want yeah yeah okay yeah no

1642
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:46,159
yeah it's it's very fine okay balance

1643
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:49,909
there are three black bands around the

1644
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:55,039
top and each of them is in a script that

1645
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:58,149
you can recognize it is it's a

1646
01:17:55,039 --> 01:18:00,439
bookkeeping script like a monastic

1647
01:17:58,149 --> 01:18:02,659
bookkeeping script okay so it would be

1648
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:05,479
used for poetry or anything like that

1649
01:18:02,659 --> 01:18:07,159
it's really it's meant to be as didactic

1650
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:09,949
as possible right for accounting

1651
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:19,279
purposes basically it records the first

1652
01:18:09,949 --> 01:18:22,399
ring says two six star on her ascension

1653
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:25,849
to master um and then each of these

1654
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:30,589
rings goes to goes through another

1655
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:33,140
masters Ascension and then presumably

1656
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:35,119
it's passed down you're not sure if the

1657
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:37,670
top is the most recent or the bottom is

1658
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:41,590
the most recent but it's clearly it's an

1659
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:44,750
important act this staff is passed from

1660
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:46,250
from masters to students who then ascend

1661
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,739
and this is a tradition that I'm not

1662
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:51,909
familiar with it wasn't a part of it

1663
01:18:48,739 --> 01:18:55,159
wasn't a part of your way of the shadow

1664
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:57,139
rituals but it's not unheard of

1665
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:59,359
okay like a Stanley Cup of sticks yeah

1666
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:00,680
exactly justifications all over second I

1667
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:04,639
up I think

1668
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:06,800
her two tickets wrist athlete Mike

1669
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:11,480
that's my vote so named vote in the

1670
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:14,239
channel for the better no yes I went

dick yeah check this out if you keep

1672
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:19,489
some mouth let me get detection field I

1673
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:21,800
mean it's woman up I can it looks alive

1674
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:23,269
a color yeah it does all have good okay

1675
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,720
nobody years a better can of but not a

1676
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:30,470
prize role it's a 22 yeah it's very good

1677
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:33,860
I mean this is this appears yeah as you

1678
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:36,890
as you begin to investigate it just sort

1679
01:19:33,859 --> 01:19:39,799
of turning it this way in that in the

1680
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:44,740
Emerald light that is emanating from the

1681
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:52,909
tunnel it's sort of the faster it moves

1682
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:55,880
the less coherent it becomes so but

1683
01:19:52,909 --> 01:19:59,029
there's no magic oh if you detect its

1684
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:02,029
magical as it s alright great it's magic

1685
01:19:59,029 --> 01:20:04,729
it's magic AF could be more than half I

1686
01:20:02,029 --> 01:20:07,699
recommend you you will do stuff and you

1687
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:11,449
move it very fast and stop it inside a

1688
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:13,970
person I'm probably take this average I

1689
01:20:11,449 --> 01:20:16,069
was like no dude it's negative n note it

1690
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:18,590
event it's like it's like the arcane

1691
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:21,349
Roadshow yeah right it's just like

1692
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:23,300

right so the quarter staff is clattered

1733
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:16,000
down the stairs has rolled to a stop

1734
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:18,270
here in the base you can tell even as

1735
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,649
you go down the stairs are slightly

1736
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:23,980
slippery mm-hmm

1737
01:22:20,649 --> 01:22:25,779

it isn't planning from hot ok it's warm

1742
01:22:33,219 --> 01:22:36,698
you would say Fahmy

1743
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:37,500
yeah it's like it's like a winter fresh

1744
01:22:36,698 --> 01:22:41,589
mouth gotcha

1745
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:44,920
yes is it yeah I made that noise oh yeah

1746
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:47,140
exactly but but that's that's the

1747
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:52,179
situation rabbit but as you are going

1748
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:56,650
down you can this is this this stairway

1749
01:22:52,179 --> 01:22:59,289
it has some what you might describe as

1750
01:22:56,649 --> 01:23:01,960
aftermarket features okay

1751
01:22:59,289 --> 01:23:06,640
such as so as you are as you're going

1752
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:13,179
about halfway down you can see that the

1753
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:15,400
stone the work stone parts at two

1754
01:23:13,179 --> 01:23:19,899
thresholds to separate thresholds on the

1755
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:23,319
way down and you can see a series of

1756
01:23:19,899 --> 01:23:26,500
regular holes

1757
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:28,719
okay and then as you not fancy holes

1758
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,489
just regular holy what regular in terms

1759
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,900
of how they are related in and gotcha

1760
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:33,699
gotcha they're not actual they don't

1761
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:34,269
come from they're not from rodents okay

1762
01:23:33,699 --> 01:23:36,159
right

1763
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:38,920
this is birds don't live in here got

1764
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:41,229
your like this is it isn't purposeful

1765
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,520
and intentional yeah yeah your classical

1766
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:45,849
you go you're alone you get it all you

1767
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:51,240
get whole like this but as you are

1768
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:54,700
approaching as you approach them stones

1769
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:55,989
revolve and cover them up and then you

1770
01:23:54,699 --> 01:23:58,720
can see that there's another row of

1771
01:23:55,989 --> 01:24:00,909
these farther down and as you approach

1772
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:03,250
stones cover those up as well

1773
01:24:00,909 --> 01:24:05,319
and you continue down okay shy and the

1774
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:07,329
holes increase in quality yeah exactly

1775
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:09,279
we start to see finer and finer grades

1776
01:24:07,329 --> 01:24:11,319
of all oh yeah go ahead of us a real

1777
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:16,059
larger date I'm all the way the bottom a

1778
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:19,119
necessary Randa larger gauges of hole

1779
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:20,350
yeah no I'm with everybody but okay I

1780
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:22,869
didn't know if we were all seamless just

01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:24,430
innocence yeah so are the behind us is

1782
01:24:22,869 --> 01:24:26,319
this happening is revealing themselves

1783
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:28,780
no no no exactly no no and in fact in

1784
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:31,239
fact as you go down as soon as a person

1785
01:24:28,779 --> 01:24:33,309
as soon as there is a space between you

1786
01:24:31,239 --> 01:24:34,630
they reveal themselves and then as soon

1787
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:36,400
as one of you comes by they actually

1788
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:38,800
close back I try to do a self approach

1789
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:41,289
all of these holes so that maybe it

1790
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,789
wouldn't close up here if it's dry and I

1791
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:44,680
know you still have passive uh face

1792
01:24:42,789 --> 01:24:52,899
attractive no that's on the cart it's

1793
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:53,710
just a card does it good one a lot 23 I

1794
01:24:52,899 --> 01:24:57,129
was good

1795
01:24:53,710 --> 01:25:00,579
absolutely so you you you maximize your

1796
01:24:57,130 --> 01:25:03,520
stealthiness yeah every absolutely every

1797
01:25:00,579 --> 01:25:05,829
capacity you have to not be noticed

1798
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,680
learned over a hundred and fifty years

1799
01:25:05,829 --> 01:25:12,550
and it doesn't work is leveraged

1800
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:15,610
definitive rocks yeah it's not it's not

1801
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:17,440
connect you far as you can tell because

1802
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:20,469
you you killed it you know you killed it

1803
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:22,779
I did okay right it's not connected to

1804
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:26,650
the sound yeah okay Mission Impossible

1805
01:25:22,779 --> 01:25:29,710
link up and down there's my wire it's

1806
01:25:26,649 --> 01:25:32,229
like nothing I suppose what's up oh my

1807
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:34,000
god yeah alright let's continue then he

1808
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:36,449
has anything expensive they want to try

1809
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,079
on the tail or what's her what's her

1810
01:25:36,449 --> 01:25:42,149
like like our pullback scenario like are

1811
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:44,159
we just kind of like I love going into

1812
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:46,829
the earth I feel good

1813
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:48,779
I like these holes but we were just

1814
01:25:46,829 --> 01:25:50,699
going to go back to there our office

1815
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:52,979
yeah what's the draw hand and really we

1816
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:56,250
have to you're a cool staff out of this

1817
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:59,549
yeah you're you know your excursions

1818
01:25:56,250 --> 01:26:02,760
below the earth's crust you are

1819
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:05,159
generally speaking cool and damp these

1820
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:07,199
are for you these are great these are

1821
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:08,399
positives yeah yeah right I can actually

1822
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,139
see how this would be a draw for you

1823
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:13,349
exactly a lot yeah I mean I would be the

1824
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:15,840
one who going but I feel myself like I'm

1825
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:18,120
used to that pole and I've gotten I've

1826
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,500
gone too deep at times so I'm like

1827
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:21,329
before we go crazy

1828
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:24,210
exactly but this is not but this is not

1829
01:26:21,329 --> 01:26:26,519
like that it is not cool oh I see and it

1830
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:32,039
is not dark I don't like honestly and it

1831
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:37,770
is slick but not damp this this

1832
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:39,989
environment is unlike your homeland if

1833
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:43,200
you're just damp not slick exactly now

1834
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:47,130
in the base as you as you enter the

1835
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:49,920
large area in the bottom it's a are you

1836
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:53,220
are you already cartography yes this

1837
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:54,930
kicks ass I know I was so pleased I was

1838
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:57,930
also pleased I was going to chastise you

1839
01:26:54,930 --> 01:27:00,720
but you're kicking ass now so this is

1840
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:04,650
important information for you yeah this

1841
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:10,409
stairway goes down and then opens out

1842
01:27:04,649 --> 01:27:13,319
into a vast realm chamber okay

1843
01:27:10,409 --> 01:27:18,149
sister look at inside of a tandoor or

1844
01:27:13,319 --> 01:27:21,059
something like it's bulbous interior

1845
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:25,859
section you can see that down at the

1846
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:28,770
bottom to the left is an exit to the

1847
01:27:25,859 --> 01:27:30,509
right is another exit I feel like I'm

1848
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:33,180
telling people how to get off of a plane

1849
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:34,650
um in the event of an emergency we're

1850
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:37,020
going to need to know so in the very

1851
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:39,059
center there may be an emergency in the

1852
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:45,960
very center of this room like the event

1853
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:48,480
is a gigantic fountain but the fluid the

1854
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,050
the water that you heard is not water in

1855
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:51,178
the classic

1856
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:53,219
since of course never I would've never

1857
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:59,809
is right why would it be Clamato

1858
01:27:53,219 --> 01:28:02,189
yeah it's cool motto no no it is warm

1859
01:27:59,809 --> 01:28:04,289
when you can field even feel the warmth

1860
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:07,549
of it from out here know about this yeah

1861
01:28:04,289 --> 01:28:11,460
and it has a greenish it has a greenish

1862
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:13,380
green hint that's lame

1863
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:15,090

1864
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:16,500
cream to your personality

1865
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:18,270
listen you're talking with the brand

1866
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:24,179
yeah survival so I can like smell it

1867
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:27,119
yeah yeah smells experice yes ah it

1868
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:30,300
smells good it's 16 yeah this is this is

1869
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:34,828
not safe no this is this is something

1870
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:37,440
you would see in a in a deep cavern acid

1871
01:28:34,828 --> 01:28:40,259
like a yeah by a bank a sulfuric acid

1872
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:42,328
like like like like this is not the sort

1873
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:44,340
of hot spring you would sit in so

1874
01:28:42,328 --> 01:28:47,158
unfortunately like all dogs I got to get

1875
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:49,980
into the trash and this is like all dogs

1876
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:55,519
I go to heaven like here we get the

1877
01:28:49,979 --> 01:28:57,839
ipecac ready I go in on that ya know I

1878
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:02,940
been back from it like half no so the

1879
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:08,099
opposite so central fountain exits for

1880
01:29:02,939 --> 01:29:10,109
and ass and in the back of the room is

1881
01:29:08,099 --> 01:29:11,369
you know so basically these are all sort

1882
01:29:10,109 --> 01:29:15,089
of equi distant from each other around

1883
01:29:11,368 --> 01:29:19,710
this orb this sort of round area that

1884
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:22,050
you guys are in the ceilings is doesn't

1885
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:25,349
seem worked seems almost like a natural

1886
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:27,179
formation and then the opposite wall

1887
01:29:25,349 --> 01:29:35,340
where the other eggs that would be in

1888
01:29:27,179 --> 01:29:38,880
this classic thing is a black gate that

1889
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:40,770
has in its center but it's round it

1890
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:46,760
isn't in the classic sort of portal type

1891
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:50,699
shape it is a round sort of almost

1892
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:57,020
oculus type shape the outer ring is

1893
01:29:50,698 --> 01:29:57,019
broken into eight equally sized pieces

1894
01:29:59,368 --> 01:30:04,710
seven of the symbols you do not

1895
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:06,480
recognize and one symbol you do

1896
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:12,779
recognize because it is the symbol that

1897
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:14,189
is on your focus and then enter yeah so

1898
01:30:12,779 --> 01:30:15,929
we have you have the eight around the

1899
01:30:14,189 --> 01:30:18,928
edge and then in the center it is

1900
01:30:15,929 --> 01:30:23,539
equally divided into three parts three

1901
01:30:18,929 --> 01:30:25,920
in the center okay but this is this is a

1902
01:30:23,539 --> 01:30:27,719
crease see symbols and I'll give them to

1903
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:31,139
you after the game

1904
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:33,300
sure yeah um course the pour-over jota

1905
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:36,329
for him did i don't know ever so alright

1906
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:39,510
i want to start yelling now I recognize

1907
01:30:36,329 --> 01:30:41,639
my symbol but all that I can't read it

1908
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:43,560
I just know the shape yeah you know you

1909
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:48,270
know you know the shape but this is the

1910
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:49,289
thing right by this like you've always

1911
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:52,230
known it

1912
01:30:49,289 --> 01:30:54,569
it gives me context you have Mekons

1913
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:58,289
angle because you can see the rest of

1914
01:30:54,569 --> 01:30:59,368
this dark alphabet that it is a part I

1915
01:30:58,289 --> 01:31:07,260
don't know

1916
01:30:59,368 --> 01:31:11,698
it is not concern it is the earth that's

1917
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:14,429
the name of your th e you are that's the

1918
01:31:11,698 --> 01:31:20,039
name of your that is the name of that

1919
01:31:14,429 --> 01:31:22,349
symbol I see oh so hungry for that you

1920
01:31:20,039 --> 01:31:26,609
should see I'm transfixed it's like yes

1921
01:31:22,349 --> 01:31:29,460
she is lugg that there and I'll get [ __ ]

1922
01:31:26,609 --> 01:31:31,679
one thing about it any other part of my

1923
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:34,948
life and I just turn it I'm like don't

1924
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:37,529
worry about the cops following us I was

1925
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:40,079
asleep for part of it I was expecting to

1926
01:31:37,529 --> 01:31:43,529
wake up by the egg you got a second

1927
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:48,059
fuzzy on if you say that I say shut my

1928
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:51,658
egg hey you're a where's my egg

1929
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:54,719
I look can we leave them here let's put

1930
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:58,408
it up to a vote under sniff the gate and

1931
01:31:54,719 --> 01:32:00,868
I'm like vote yes leave here what so can

1932
01:31:58,408 --> 01:32:02,039
i I can only discern that one

1933
01:32:00,868 --> 01:32:03,359
that's right through but I'm not right

1934
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:04,920
not the others do the other the other

1935
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:10,649
and I'm going to write the the others

1936
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:12,809
don't mean anything directly even you

1937
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:15,238
know what your symbol is called

1938
01:32:12,809 --> 01:32:18,150
um it's also how coming how close are

1939
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:20,399
you to this thing I think so right now

1940
01:32:18,149 --> 01:32:21,058
you have what's the diameter of this

1941
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:24,238
room

1942
01:32:21,059 --> 01:32:25,860
right now standing at the like closer to

1943
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:30,538
the steps I'm looking at it exactly so

1944
01:32:25,859 --> 01:32:33,029
so the the fountain is in the center of

1945
01:32:30,538 --> 01:32:38,368
this circle right and the radius is 30

1946
01:32:33,029 --> 01:32:40,889
feet okay okay so 60 K over so um yeah

1947
01:32:38,368 --> 01:32:43,769
let me let me kind of split the

1948
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:46,800
difference as I go around it so I'm not

1949
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:49,530
walking to the fountain yeah but yeah

1950
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,690
you can safely avoid this yeah I get I

1951
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:54,059
get halfway up yeah if right and if I

1952
01:32:51,689 --> 01:32:55,888
feel like can I do perception for for

1953
01:32:54,059 --> 01:32:56,639
traps and a touch just down the terrace

1954
01:32:55,889 --> 01:33:00,449
yeah

1955
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:02,400
no no can I ever that because I'm

1956
01:33:00,448 --> 01:33:05,219
staying it's a double punch I'm flanked

1957
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:06,569
by the family identifier hockey uh well

1958
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:11,038

subterranean entity and it's and it's a

2031
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:54,140
multiple choice one of them is warm it's

2032
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:56,180
warm yeah boys

2033
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:57,680

2034
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:59,840
that stuff is true except that first

2035
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:02,360
parts multiple choice mm-hmm one of them

2036
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,710
sort of looks like a keyhole one of them

2037
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:05,210
looks like a more traditional stone

2038
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:08,510
right

2039
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:10,279
one of them has like branches and

2040
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:13,100
bramble that go around the top right I

2041
01:37:10,279 --> 01:37:14,809
want it's the first of the three it sort

2042
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:17,329
of opens up and then this is slightly

2043
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:19,160
wider around the top yeah like a

2044
01:37:17,329 --> 01:37:21,470
standardized test you put it back in

2045
01:37:19,159 --> 01:37:24,109
again Tron exactly then you get your

2046
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:26,199
answer you're like home exactly describe

2047
01:37:24,109 --> 01:37:29,569
describe the temperature and environment

2048
01:37:26,199 --> 01:37:32,300

um you're the document okay so there's

2054
01:37:44,329 --> 01:37:47,720
an important time looking at this form

2055
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:51,349
is asking me about the temperature

2056
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:54,320
yeah yeah yeah environment different so

2057
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:58,460
I'm describing a warm balmy

2058
01:37:54,319 --> 01:38:00,739
and I say that it is unnaturally so and

2059
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:05,569
then I also just say that it has a

2060
01:38:00,739 --> 01:38:08,510
generic ancient stink about it okay the

2061
01:38:05,569 --> 01:38:11,029
next question is describe the features

2062
01:38:08,510 --> 01:38:14,840
of the first chamber hmm okay

2063
01:38:11,029 --> 01:38:18,500
interesting so I say I describe the

2064
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:22,100
entrance the to access the acidic

2065
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:23,930
fountain maybe the gate and I make a

2066
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:25,250
special note like maybe there maybe

2067
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:27,409
there wasn't enough room for this but I

2068
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:30,800
still do it and I note that because

2069
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:34,220
there seems unusually like the full

2070
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:37,310
title yeah course person I'm actually

2071
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:38,840
interested in it I'm in one of the the

2072
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:43,340
icons on it and then I go in this also

2073
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:45,590
to note are pelleted mysterious left

2074
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:50,390
stricken and saying his faith is shaken

2075
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:51,210
right so you're filling this out right

2076
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:54,690
now

2077
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:58,279
what everyone else - I'm walking slowly

2078
01:38:54,689 --> 01:39:01,710
and purposely toward this gate and I'm

2079
01:38:58,279 --> 01:39:06,359
grasping my relic my piece of the altar

2080
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:10,920
would the symbol on what can it was kind

2081
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:14,309
of cool checks can I do so I want what's

2082
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:16,859
good ok I already did our Ken on I did

2083
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:18,810
our count on your staff that's right you

2084
01:39:16,859 --> 01:39:22,380
can get listen you can get a zarkanians

2085
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:24,539
you one you can crank the archanan yeah

2086
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:25,829
well let's see if it way neat man I'm

2087
01:39:24,539 --> 01:39:28,800
going to dumb so I'm gonna do it on the

2088
01:39:25,829 --> 01:39:30,510
on the gate itself mmm

2089
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,750
and then what are you trying to find out

2090
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:36,360
nothing at all I'm just going to enjoy

2091
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:40,979
the mystery yeah I was there

2092
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:42,539
I was going to try to assess like in the

2093
01:39:40,979 --> 01:39:45,089
same way that he's trying to determine

2094
01:39:42,539 --> 01:39:46,710
the nature of whatever entity may exist

2095
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:48,810
in this space that's what I wanted to

2096
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:50,970
know right I don't know what you are so

2097
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:55,440
the closer you get to it so you you have

2098
01:39:50,970 --> 01:40:01,260
produced your focus the closer you get

2099
01:39:55,439 --> 01:40:06,139
to this door the more faces the focus

2100
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:09,390
has what so it shifts geometrically in

2101
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:15,030
your hand the closer you get to this

2102
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:17,400
gate and what's more I mean it's a the

2103
01:40:15,029 --> 01:40:20,039
nearer you get to this portal you are

2104
01:40:17,399 --> 01:40:22,289
dumbfounded let's say that's why you got

2105
01:40:20,039 --> 01:40:24,960
a 1 and not because you wrote so poorly

2106
01:40:22,289 --> 01:40:29,119
at a crucial juncture took in my

2107
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:33,119
campaign it's our food yeah our labor

2108
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:35,539
not because I'm bad know so it's like a

2109
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:38,789
raspberry like imagine it's just

2110
01:40:35,539 --> 01:40:40,439
unfolding right it's like a yeah it's

2111
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:42,420
like a full dimensional object and this

2112
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:44,189
is the 3 fish right well this exactly

2113
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:47,369
and as I said it of course the thunder

2114
01:40:44,189 --> 01:40:50,099
and lightning right um now these other

2115
01:40:47,369 --> 01:40:51,390
facets as I put it any other glyphs on

2116
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,890
the other you know they flippin with the

2117
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:54,840
others look the stones were flipping no

2118
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:58,020
I think it's like seem like a pyramid

2119
01:40:54,840 --> 01:41:02,670
shape becomes a cube want to do is

2120
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:04,650
develop a sophistication yeah but like I

2121
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:06,779
said are their volume whether we let

2122
01:41:04,649 --> 01:41:12,899
on the other side yes but they are not

2123
01:41:06,779 --> 01:41:16,050
as edged your edge for the ER is deep

2124
01:41:12,899 --> 01:41:19,639
and purposeful right it is what you cut

2125
01:41:16,050 --> 01:41:24,449
out of that altar right in the Underdark

2126
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:27,180
these other faces the the symbols on

2127
01:41:24,449 --> 01:41:29,010
them are not as strong they sort of pass

2128
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:31,440
in and out yeah

2129
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:32,880
from of definition from our distance do

2130
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:34,559
we see these changes or is the only

2131
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,909
seeing them as he gets closer like the

2132
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,830
only affecting and closest person sort

2133
01:41:35,909 --> 01:41:39,569
of thing I think maybe I'm holding it

2134
01:41:37,829 --> 01:41:41,670
out like this and you're seeing my focus

2135
01:41:39,569 --> 01:41:44,639
just changing I don't interpret any of

2136
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:52,829
the rest of it it's it is it wants to be

2137
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:55,760
here it is drawn to this home I have to

2138
01:41:52,829 --> 01:42:00,979
proceed so as I said my job eight around

2139
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:00,980
new symbols I mean it's literally a

2140
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:07,710
multiplication of your consciousness to

2141
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:11,670
see this you had seen this one symbol

2142
01:42:07,710 --> 01:42:15,000
that represented your cosmological

2143
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:18,720
understanding and there are seven more

2144
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:21,539
oh I stride all the way up there's no

2145
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:23,670
other like it's slow but it's purposeful

2146
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:24,269
it's not slow out of hesitation but of

2147
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:28,289
reverence

2148
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:31,670
so in the middle of this of this

2149
01:42:28,289 --> 01:42:33,989
Stargate yeah it's not starting

2150
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:35,310
it's a guy the ball game yeah hey family

2151
01:42:33,989 --> 01:42:38,429
honey it's me guys we just come to

2152
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:41,039
anyone else's bananas's like I said you

2153
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:44,880
can live in Stargate with us come on I

2154
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:49,079
want to oh listen up the you can see

2155
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:53,190
that there's imagine a pie cut into

2156
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:57,510
three equal wedges in the in the center

2157
01:42:53,189 --> 01:43:00,089
of this and then it's sort of it's spin

2158
01:42:57,510 --> 01:43:01,380
slightly almost like a imagine imagine

2159
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:03,150
taking a compass and setting it on a

2160
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:05,130
table and you can see imagine that it's

2161
01:43:03,149 --> 01:43:07,079
sort of like dialing and tuning like

2162
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:10,739
it's reacting to you in a way to

2163
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:13,019
depending yeah okay yeah the five-dollar

2164
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:15,539
words keep coming up oh I keep all

2165
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:18,060
walking yeah and I'm assuming if this

2166
01:43:15,539 --> 01:43:18,868
thing is going to become a sphere yes so

2167
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:27,260
point

2168
01:43:18,868 --> 01:43:31,948
as you arrived your you can see drawn in

2169
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:36,480
broad strokes the symbol of the ER fills

2170
01:43:31,948 --> 01:43:39,299
one of the three pieces and then you

2171
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:43,948
hear a low sound that is the sound of

2172
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:46,440
that horn oh right so by the way roadies

2173
01:43:43,948 --> 01:43:48,779
I see you rotate four or five and I'm

2174
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:50,908
tired and you can stop him you are you

2175
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:52,559
like tuck a punch to the gut and yeah

2176
01:43:50,908 --> 01:43:54,960
and you're taking your doing

2177
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,469
documentation like in your implants

2178
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:00,389
again and I'm just like hell no and so

2179
01:43:58,469 --> 01:44:02,760
I'm going to run up to you and be like

2180
01:44:00,389 --> 01:44:04,739
we should probably we should probably

2181
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:06,420
check us out later the same streaks on

2182
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:07,859
the ground panará this seems like maybe

2183
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:10,199
the wrong place for us to be right now

2184
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:11,848
no you're very excited why don't we come

2185
01:44:10,198 --> 01:44:12,960
back later after we were group not

2186
01:44:11,849 --> 01:44:18,719
possible okay

2187
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:23,039
oh yeah it's like leaving range yes

2188
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:25,349
happens on the bottom of the document so

2189
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:27,149
you had on tell me about it so you have

2190
01:44:25,349 --> 01:44:30,449
got so you have answered these questions

2191
01:44:27,149 --> 01:44:33,269
yeah these are all standard parts of

2192
01:44:30,448 --> 01:44:37,019
this form I'm very familiar exactly yeah

2193
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:40,139
I like it's obvious like it would be

2194
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:44,659
boring if it weren't so exciting rightly

2195
01:44:40,139 --> 01:44:53,400
boring if it weren't so unborn the next

2196
01:44:44,658 --> 01:44:56,759
part of the document says the space

2197
01:44:53,399 --> 01:45:00,269
there begins to be filled with text and

2198
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:03,420
it is not text of the standard printed

2199
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:07,260
form okay it is being written as you

2200
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:10,800
read it okay and it says have you

2201
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:11,940
interacted with the Gateway and then

2202
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:15,810
there's and then there's a question mark

2203
01:45:11,939 --> 01:45:19,460
and a period and a period I hesitantly

2204
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:26,969
right no idiot

2205
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:29,399
which is true below that well actually

2206
01:45:26,969 --> 01:45:30,510
it's a liar I don't know as soon as as

2207
01:45:29,399 --> 01:45:32,309
soon as you as soon as you write the

2208
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:35,909
note the

2209
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:41,039
autumn of the paper curls up from

2210
01:45:35,909 --> 01:45:46,470
underneath your quill okay and tears

2211
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:52,529
itself off the top and folds itself into

2212
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:58,619
a bird cool that flaps out of the

2213
01:45:52,529 --> 01:46:01,949
chamber and up the composer there we're

2214
01:45:58,619 --> 01:46:04,319
just normal for my dog no no you have

2215
01:46:01,949 --> 01:46:05,670
never seen this before you know you knew

2216
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:08,969
that you knew that the document sir

2217
01:46:05,670 --> 01:46:11,609
sheath is not paper in the classic sense

2218
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:13,909
but generally speaking this is not a

2219
01:46:11,609 --> 01:46:17,989
normal thing the next piece of paper

2220
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:21,090
says this is the secretary in' of

2221
01:46:17,989 --> 01:46:24,960
acquisitions incorporated and then below

2222
01:46:21,090 --> 01:46:27,090
that it says run oh and then they

2223
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:32,489
underline it three times

2224
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:33,989
ah okay and then I say hey we uh what

2225
01:46:32,489 --> 01:46:36,920
was really close you I don't know if

2226
01:46:33,989 --> 01:46:39,420
that standard filing procedures okay and

2227
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:43,020
we have our orders from head office we

2228
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:46,109
are to run okay so said the horn the

2229
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:50,420
horn with my stomach here and then over

2230
01:46:46,109 --> 01:46:55,199
the sound of the two other parts of this

2231
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:55,649
become red-hot okay and you hear and

2232
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:59,340
written on

2233
01:46:55,649 --> 01:47:05,069
no no just okay so basically and you see

2234
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:09,210
sort of the symbols around it flashing

2235
01:47:05,069 --> 01:47:12,210
independently and you hear dissonant

2236
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:17,220
notes from the upper left and upper

2237
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:19,939
right thirds of this symbol I see the

2238
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:26,159
fountain in the middle of the room

2239
01:47:19,939 --> 01:47:31,079
becomes a just a gout of acid in seconds

2240
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:34,470
it overflows its Basin and begins to

2241
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:38,449
spill and splash out over the floor

2242
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:42,829
gotta go in fact and the room itself

2243
01:47:38,449 --> 01:47:46,429
begins to dance and sort of sway

2244
01:47:42,828 --> 01:47:49,609
you're seeing it it's the Mambo yeah

2245
01:47:46,429 --> 01:47:53,480

01:56:20,559 --> 01:56:24,159
him no and you any but you can see

2434
01:56:22,059 --> 01:56:27,159
projecting out of the back of this are

2435
01:56:24,158 --> 01:56:29,379
these writhing tentacles

2436
01:56:27,158 --> 01:56:31,769
I think it's the gates work for a moment

2437
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:39,219
yeah you know I realize it's not I

2438
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:43,090
shrink and I I move about in it briefly

2439
01:56:39,219 --> 01:56:45,819
to see if I can correct it and then I I

2440
01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:47,319
roll and head back away from you gay he

2441
01:56:45,819 --> 01:56:49,118
leaves the tentacles inside the sphere

2442
01:56:47,319 --> 01:56:50,710
they're dope they don't follow him

2443
01:56:49,118 --> 01:56:52,328
correct they're planted in the ground

2444
01:56:50,710 --> 01:56:54,550
oh no they're there they're reaching out

2445
01:56:52,328 --> 01:56:55,750
directly from the gate okay

2446
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:56,949
Oh from the gate okay okay I thought

2447
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:58,929
they're underground but he's moving away

2448
01:56:56,948 --> 01:57:00,488
from the jail yes he is moving away from

2449
01:56:58,929 --> 01:57:05,020
the tentacles but they actually don't

2450
01:57:00,488 --> 01:57:07,029

trying to get better signal yeah I

2452
01:57:07,029 --> 01:57:10,420

good you get to you get to the exit on

2527
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:47,630
the left and you see that this is

2528
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:50,090
actually a staircase exactly like the

2529
02:00:47,630 --> 02:00:51,350
other one all three of them you could

2530
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:53,060
look back you see that these are all

2531
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:57,860
identical staircases that

2532
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:59,900
go up and you see just rivulet of mucus

2533
02:00:57,859 --> 02:01:01,759
okay at this point just because we're

2534
02:00:59,899 --> 02:01:03,109
chilling an acid and he's out of the

2535
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,670
acid because you're holding him and I

2536
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:06,619

2537
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:08,539

stair with okay well then let's go in

2551
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:44,720
the gate everyone figure hop in

2552
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:48,020
so you are so you are you are walking

2553
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:49,699
carefully pushing your way up not just

2554
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:52,370
things through that through the stairs

2555
02:01:49,699 --> 02:01:57,789
you can stand they will flow through but

2556
02:01:52,369 --> 02:02:02,180
it has it's very it's very careful

2557
02:01:57,789 --> 02:02:04,579
particular work climbing these stairs is

2558
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:08,360
that like really viscous yes okay yes

2559
02:02:04,579 --> 02:02:13,579
yes and you can you can see that at the

2560
02:02:08,359 --> 02:02:15,849
top the path is actually closed you can

2561
02:02:13,579 --> 02:02:18,170
see that you can see that there is

2562
02:02:15,850 --> 02:02:20,630
almost stone like you would select you

2563
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:23,510
would brick up or stone up a door you

2564
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:26,650
can see that it's that it's closed at

2565
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:30,050
the very end but you can see that a

2566
02:02:26,649 --> 02:02:33,139
small portal at the top you can see that

2567
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:36,230
there is a way to look through let's go

2568
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:40,820
look through there a paper bird was

2569
02:02:36,229 --> 02:02:42,379
right yes yeah we got to go go up if I

2570
02:02:40,819 --> 02:02:44,659
have again getting it far away from the

2571
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:49,880
gate as we can yeah so you can see and

2572
02:02:44,659 --> 02:02:53,000
you can you can feel the place shifting

2573
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:56,470
as you're going up these stairs and so

2574
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:59,779
through that portal you can see earth

2575
02:02:56,470 --> 02:03:03,590
piling up against the islands no oh no

2576
02:02:59,779 --> 02:03:07,009
oh and you can see that acid has now

2577
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:09,680
begun to fill up and it's now

2578
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:11,360
going to rise up into this passage I

2579
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:12,650
actual nightmare okay can we bust

2580
02:03:11,359 --> 02:03:15,859

2591

I mean you can't dodge right it's an Taj

2614
02:04:41,569 --> 02:04:45,979
it's true but listen there are there are

2615
02:04:43,789 --> 02:04:47,510
rules to this stuff okay so you are and

2616
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:49,879
it doesn't honestly it doesn't hurt the

2617
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:51,680
dramatic arc for you to be slamming your

2618
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:53,630
sword against this a couple times it's

2619
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:56,390
here it's a lesson

2620
02:04:53,630 --> 02:05:01,190
it wasn't eight yeah yeah keep going

2621
02:04:56,390 --> 02:05:04,039
yeah oh my god no no we're good go get

2622
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:06,379
it so it did a gasps oh you are so hot

2623
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:10,069
over here I so you basically you use you

2624
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:14,199
shrug drifts off and he slips down a

2625
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:16,969
couple steps yeah and then you see

2626
02:05:14,199 --> 02:05:18,050
Denard Blitzen at the top of this

2627
02:05:16,970 --> 02:05:21,739
passage

2628
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:23,989
just with all of his draconic might just

2629
02:05:21,738 --> 02:05:28,069
slamming toothbrush against this rock

2630
02:05:23,988 --> 02:05:32,229
and then the third and final hit it

2631
02:05:28,069 --> 02:05:36,429
connects clean and then you can feel the

2632
02:05:32,229 --> 02:05:40,849
shock wave off of this thunderous smite

2633
02:05:36,429 --> 02:05:42,949
and you lose a couple steps okay in it

2634
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:45,770
I mean you you're kicking yourself up

2635
02:05:42,948 --> 02:05:48,919
against this rising wave of acid

2636
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:50,090
these rocks are shattered and they start

2637
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:54,199
to fall past you

2638
02:05:50,090 --> 02:05:56,449
along with earth and rubble pushing down

2639
02:05:54,198 --> 02:05:59,658
so right now you're right now you are

2640
02:05:56,448 --> 02:06:03,019
essentially buried you need to find a

2641
02:05:59,658 --> 02:06:05,238
way through can I do any kind of decks

2642
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:05,929
to dodge around and jump on top to be to

2643
02:06:05,238 --> 02:06:08,178
be safe

2644
02:06:05,929 --> 02:06:10,010
yeah yeah you can be if you can be as

2645
02:06:08,179 --> 02:06:12,469
safe as you can but the reality is that

2646
02:06:10,010 --> 02:06:15,770
you're still interred okay so we can't

2647
02:06:12,469 --> 02:06:17,989
be interred I poop okay so we got a dig

2648
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:20,510
mentality still coming any farce friends

I have not officially grandma man see

2663
02:06:53,539 --> 02:06:57,319
but I've had some difficult children in

2664
02:06:55,670 --> 02:07:02,929
my life and I should have come up and

2665
02:06:57,319 --> 02:07:08,090
I'm like wake up right no please me nude

2666
02:07:02,929 --> 02:07:11,270
us dig us hell and I I am clearly awake

2667
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:14,329
like I'm not I'm just that annoying yeah

2668
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:21,350
that's the abuse again alright one point

2669
02:07:14,329 --> 02:07:23,029
of what if I want her um I'm trying to

2670
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:24,620
figure out a way that we could that we

2671
02:07:23,029 --> 02:07:26,210
could get out but it's a there's an

2672
02:07:24,619 --> 02:07:27,889
important moment for cuts risk

2673
02:07:26,210 --> 02:07:28,448
interrogate I'm also going to intimidate

2674
02:07:27,889 --> 02:07:31,130
you

2675
02:07:28,448 --> 02:07:33,250
so I'm going to date you this is Mike

2676
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:36,650
our chair yeah yeah we're doing a real

2677
02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:38,119
you borrow you can't borrow I was going

2678
02:07:36,649 --> 02:07:41,479
to say the reason why it's an important

2679
02:07:38,119 --> 02:07:43,399
moment for me is because I'm I know I'm

2680
02:07:41,479 --> 02:07:47,019
too weak to survive the answers that

2681
02:07:43,399 --> 02:07:50,689
await me I also know that that this God

2682
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:52,370
is not the one I wanted but it could

2683
02:07:50,689 --> 02:07:54,769
lead me to somewhere something closer

2684
02:07:52,369 --> 02:07:57,559
God you deserve it but I also know that

2685
02:07:54,770 --> 02:08:00,590
if I act to help us leave that that is

2686
02:07:57,560 --> 02:08:05,659
essentially me telling this this god of

2687
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:07,219
teeth that I reject it or and I can no

2688
02:08:05,658 --> 02:08:10,339
longer pretend that I'm in its service

2689
02:08:07,219 --> 02:08:11,750
yes or is it you proving to the god of

2690
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:13,369
teeth that you're strong enough to

2691
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:14,840
survive this trial that he's putting you

2692
02:08:13,369 --> 02:08:19,158
through right now oh I know better than

2693
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:20,539

but I'll write equation for what

2837
02:14:26,569 --> 02:14:31,189
happened yeah we're gonna have a long

2838
02:14:29,029 --> 02:14:33,739
talk when you get home right we're gonna

2839
02:14:31,189 --> 02:14:36,649
do your grams of intervention

2840
02:14:33,739 --> 02:14:40,460
yeah it's intervention yes it's the same

2841
02:14:36,649 --> 02:14:41,449
as anything thing so you guys pile back

2842
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:45,230
into your cart

2843
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:48,289
I assume this is the mostly quiet return

2844
02:14:45,229 --> 02:14:50,959
trip but if I'm if I'm wrong I'm going

2845
02:14:48,289 --> 02:14:52,550
to map us back mm-hmm I want to know

2846
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:54,470

out of the spoon care so as that work as

2870

the Sun as the Sun rises it's much

2871
02:16:00,619 --> 02:16:04,970
easier to navigate your way through

2872
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:08,000
these old overgrown roads you're able to

2873
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:10,400
find your way back to the long road and

2874
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:13,729
get north the dune Gideon was not a

2875
02:16:10,399 --> 02:16:19,699
great distance south you are able to

2876
02:16:13,729 --> 02:16:22,309
roll back in to red larch where the

2877
02:16:19,699 --> 02:16:25,960
destron Valley branch of the acquisition

2878
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:30,020
incorporated franchise escort is is

2879
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:32,090
centered at the drawn and quartered well

2880
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:35,300
we have a long thoughtful look at

2881
02:16:32,090 --> 02:16:37,489
welfare yeah exactly

2882
02:16:35,299 --> 02:16:40,009
those were so much simpler yes so you

2883
02:16:37,489 --> 02:16:43,309
look so you look over left you can see

2884
02:16:40,010 --> 02:16:47,120
well versed wagons you can see his is

2885
02:16:43,309 --> 02:16:50,920
son dutifully trying to maintain the

2886
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:54,170
business you know that in one of those

2887
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:56,479
wagon holes he has in the back that

2888
02:16:54,170 --> 02:17:00,679
well-versed snooze in a way curled

2889
02:16:56,479 --> 02:17:03,260
around a hammer exactly that he called

2890
02:17:00,679 --> 02:17:06,170
Rosie baby Rossum is written on it and

2891
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:09,649
then you look with Lee and then as you

2892
02:17:06,170 --> 02:17:13,099
look right you see four carts and this

2893
02:17:09,649 --> 02:17:16,479
is not a this is not a I've tried my

2894
02:17:13,099 --> 02:17:21,770
best to establish like what tier of town

2895
02:17:16,479 --> 02:17:26,149
red larch is you see four separate carts

2896
02:17:21,770 --> 02:17:30,409
at the drawn and quarter and they are

2897
02:17:26,149 --> 02:17:32,770
you recognize them instantly this is

2898
02:17:30,409 --> 02:17:37,399
these are these these are very similar

2899
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:39,409
to the cart that brought you here but

2900
02:17:37,399 --> 02:17:44,989
these are these are not generic carts

2901
02:17:39,409 --> 02:17:52,069
this is Dragonborn royalty but not of

2902
02:17:44,989 --> 02:17:55,760
your clam so this is this is their

2903
02:17:52,069 --> 02:17:58,940
there's another obviously Gennari

2904
02:17:55,760 --> 02:18:03,880
or generis in the eastern ridge of the

2905
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:07,639
sword mountain scala another Dragonborn

2906
02:18:03,879 --> 02:18:10,250
enclave farther to the north more

2907
02:18:07,638 --> 02:18:14,569
platinum caste generally speaking in

2908
02:18:10,250 --> 02:18:17,200
their upper echelon you can see that

2909
02:18:14,569 --> 02:18:20,888
there are four such carts out front of

2910
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:20,889
the drowning courtier

2911
02:18:22,299 --> 02:18:30,938

and she says

3013
02:24:27,658 --> 02:24:38,520
I did wonder what I would say now I know

3014
02:24:33,770 --> 02:24:40,619
bang I wondered at what sort of creature

3015
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:47,460
would be responsible for something like

3016
02:24:40,619 --> 02:24:52,800
this and I don't think that you have the

3017
02:24:47,459 --> 02:24:56,000
intellect to pull this off I think that

3018
02:24:52,799 --> 02:25:00,559
you have been manipulated by powers

3019
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:03,959
beyond yourself and I pity you

3020
02:25:00,559 --> 02:25:05,988
that's the weirdest thank you I think

3021
02:25:03,959 --> 02:25:08,278
I've ever heard in my life it's lady

3022
02:25:05,988 --> 02:25:09,840
she's jesting would have been better as

3023
02:25:08,279 --> 02:25:12,658
an omelet and thought it was going to be

3024
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:15,148
before I found 80 turns and she walks to

3025
02:25:12,658 --> 02:25:17,340
the door and you can see on the you can

3026
02:25:15,148 --> 02:25:23,698
see as she gets to the door and opens it

3027
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:27,869
she goes like this ah that's the end

3028
02:25:23,699 --> 02:25:32,300
what gets me is avail of this week's

3029
02:25:27,869 --> 02:25:34,699
adventure positions incorporated on TV

3030
02:25:32,299 --> 02:25:38,250
what a pleasure

3031
02:25:34,699 --> 02:25:40,560

3032
02:25:38,250 --> 02:25:41,939
