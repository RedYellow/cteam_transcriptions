with a surplus of rats the job was

118
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:49,939
placed by one mayor Fran Elsa Gore and

119
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:54,629
upon arriving in town having met him

120
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:58,319
definitely in the coop continuum has a

121
00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:00,449
lot of dad jokes at the ready which is

122
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,819
to his credit I mean that's I've got the

123
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:08,639
premium material there for my people you

124
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:11,399
began to move around the town directed

125
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:16,019
on your map to two distinct zones the

126
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:18,209
first a hassling in one of the few

127
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:21,060
bright places when a few cheery places

128
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,939
in NEMA's eared ironbark and I believe

129
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,649
it was

130
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:30,689
oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho well it is indeed the

131
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:33,649
ironbark in and you noticed because it

132
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:37,469
would be impossible not to notice that

133
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:43,199
rosy be stinger has a reputation that

134
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:47,090
needs her in some quarters but the rat

135
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:51,599
infestation was in the baseball the

136
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:54,509
party split quite conveniently for

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,860
davines purpose because the moment that

138
00:06:54,509 --> 00:07:01,709
the foe had been crushed Devine took

139
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:09,680

00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:12,329
route with searing cold moonlight and

141
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,019

into the ground

143
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:15,959

144
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:20,189
Constitution safe no I don't need

145
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:22,769

you have received a rare daytime summons

188
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:02,060
to the high house that rests in on the

189
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,059
mound in the center of Nana's ear

190
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:11,278
I mean are we going listen I'm sorry we

hand-cranked lift don't like me yeah so

speak right on the edge up high you can

195
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:36,230
see the city itself you can see it's

196
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,399
strange whirls and it's odd construction

197
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,850
broaden even greater relief by the

198
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,759
altitude you have been here before but

199
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,420
as I said never never in the day that is

200
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:51,929
not when the daughters of MELAS do their

201
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:56,969
work in this town or indeed any other

202
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:59,929
town so as you as you approach the high

203
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,889
house it knows you well by now and

204
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:06,370
allows you access

205
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:13,659
through the main doors and is a strange

206
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:16,629
place within peopled by rafts of unseen

207
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:20,949
servants that move silently purposefully

208
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:24,159
around the compound you know precisely

209
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:28,540
how to enter the inner chambers there is

210
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:32,039
a bust on a shelf in a sitting room and

211
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:36,449
when you turn the head of this bust away

212
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:39,399
from the secret door it reveals itself

213
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:44,070
passing through their door closing

214
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:49,360
behind you inside you can see an orrery

215
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:54,580
in a immaculate beautiful wood paneled

216
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:59,169
study and you know only to will how it

217
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:04,030
must be configured celestially to allow

218
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:09,610
entree into the second the deeper secret

219
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:14,319
of this house and the moment you have

220
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:16,389
done that as you're shifting the planet

221
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,360
surrounding us already the gentle light

222
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:22,000
that they cast is pushing strange

223
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,009
shadows in the corners farther and

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,570
farther away and you can tell that

225
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:29,039
they're not moving the way that they

226
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,410
should when the light moves they should

227
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:34,750
cede their space that's that's the

228
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:37,750
ancient law and what is happening is

229
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,610
instead is its reticent to leave some of

230
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:45,490
these corners as the secret door opens

231
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:48,070
just a black mist pours through the

232
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:54,070
crevice and it draws these errant

233
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:57,010
shadows into itself and generally

234
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,800
speaking this entity is kept well in

235
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:03,819
hand you've heard stories of other

236
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:05,319
daughters that have fallen to it simply

237
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,520
in the prosecution of their normal

238
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,940
duties and it's draws itself close to

239
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,909
you and sniffs your neck

240
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:20,290
and it is at that moment that you hear a

241
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:21,039
voice from beyond the door pushing the

242
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:27,039
door open

243
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:29,349
it says Prince where are our manners you

244
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,539
can see it flatten itself out and draw

245
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,300
itself back into some dark place beneath

246
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:40,328
a chair a table partitioning is itself

247
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:42,309
as necessary to occupy the space and

248
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:45,669
this is this voice the voice of your

249
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:48,879
mentor who you have known most of your

250
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:51,969
adult life says you are precious to me

251
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:58,000
you may enter waves you into the back

252
00:13:51,970 --> 00:14:01,120
room a holy place a sanctified place for

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,458
that is where the black altar of MELAS

254
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:10,389
rests Carthoris Trobe Himself would

255
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:14,169
recognize this a device of this

256
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:17,139
construction having found it half buried

257
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:19,299
in the Underdark and a momentary

258
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:24,129
exchanger that changed the course of his

259
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:31,899
life you see this only during the

260
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:34,360
highest rituals and he issues his edicts

261
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,009
which you know is law he says to the

262
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,500
south and the sombre Hills there is a

263
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:40,679
cavern which bears the mark of our

264
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,870
mother the rightful heir to this forest

265
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:48,309
you were to go there and determine what

266
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:51,789
power it may hold and then you know you

267
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:55,929
know the altar to be a solid thing the

268
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:58,360
physical thing a single thing but when

269
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:00,909
he sweeps his hand through the top it's

270
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,720
like a well it's like the water of a

271
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:04,689
wishing well

272
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,449
and then as he dips his hand down into

273
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:11,800
its depths when it emerges it has a

274
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:14,859
black dagger that has that symbol which

275
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:20,919
is most precious to you that of the

276
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:25,570

of the alley you can see the hand that

325
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:23,570
holds the dagger that she has sort of

326
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:26,808
lifting and raising around and in an

327
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:38,509

drug the dagger the dagger strikes the

337
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:15,589
back of your hand and then goes through

338
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:18,409
the wound and joins the focus stabbed

339
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:20,750

minute no if I rated Catherine no it

681
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:51,260
does not hit me if I'm wearing a garment

682
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:55,099
that you know so and then you deliver a

683
00:33:51,259 --> 00:34:00,710

684
00:33:55,099 --> 00:34:03,079

just takes to the air push us off the

687
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:13,909
ground and goes right for Chris's throat

688
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:16,879
and then you use your opportunity no

689
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:20,300
doubt a sort of water oriented technique

690
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:24,019
just to absorb the absorb it and then

691
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:26,780
just guide her to the other side of the

692
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:29,989
alley just manipulate her own momentum

693
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:34,190
around and I'm now going to stand over

694
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:36,349
you with my staff and try to block you

695
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,929

00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:20,949
David Bowie yeah yeah what's the coolest

905
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,360
you can hold it um yeah that's it and

906
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,429
really enough to see it in the light and

907
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,950
I my eyes aren't too good so I you know

908
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:28,899
so old could you could you bring that

909
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:33,189
closer as close as you can I really like

910
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,460
take a look just real close just real

911
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:42,429
close

912
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:43,119
yeah the closest of course if I must hi

913
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,299
I guess

914
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,880
Genaro look like what is this about what

915
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:53,110
is this business women am i right yeah

916
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:56,110
and then I was mice as strong as I can

917
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:57,820
around it I do show it to you close to

918
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,250
my body but yeah okay

919
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,800
I mean it's attached to me by a chain

920
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,780
but yeah it's chained to you yeah oh I

921
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,750
didn't realize okay like a wallet chain

922
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:09,580
situation very tiny a really great

923
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,960
change you know very cool was anything

924
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:13,210
happening when he holds it does it

925
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,539
because it usually reacts and weird ways

926
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:18,250
when I order oh yeah like if someone

927
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:20,679
else held it like if the beam holds it

928
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:24,699
does it do anything different yeah yeah

929
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:30,329
is that Carly I don't think okay my gosh

930
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:33,879

unarmed attack and just try to knock it

934
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:43,150

grand slam

1041
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:10,858
it's a Graham flag Randall

1042
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,500
it's a Grand Slam yeah okay someone over

1043
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:17,489
my hammy okay so normally I would say

1044
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:19,289
that I have to so I might like on my

1045
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:20,489
next turn I would be able to hurl it but

1046
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:23,969
I'm just threatening you and it's like

1047
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:26,549
everything around the [ __ ] yeah

1048
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:29,309
everything is like table side like you

1049
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:30,810
on Bay yeah yeah I just wanted like yeah

1050
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:32,969
it's right in your face there's flame

1051
00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:34,259
and so then on my next will we can maybe

1052
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:35,279
we can fund a little bit my next action

1053
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,150
would be like I could hurl it but I

1054
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,920
guess that would be when I would do

1055
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,200
damage on it okay I just wanna make it

1056
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,309
cool I'm writing a face and threatening

1057
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:44,098
you what are you gonna do else are you

1058
00:50:41,309 --> 00:50:46,920
cooking it I think step back okay yes

1059
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:48,990
I'm just getting really bad yeah going

1060
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,309
on so this you have to pause here is

1061
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:53,639
because I'm trying to figure out what we

1062
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:56,130
can do not knowing this yeah yeah how he

1063
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:58,920
would react oh no absolutely that's true

1064
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,450
so I don't know how I would react I'm

1065
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:05,849
gonna try and I'm gonna try and yank it

1066
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:07,108
back although that's a fireball you're

1067
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:08,760
gonna pull the fireball toward your son

1068
00:51:07,108 --> 00:51:10,829
yes I'm gonna grab it in a mine big down

1069
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,740
so I bellow it where's the one I want

1070
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:18,269
you each to roll a strength check and

1071
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:20,159
add your bonus it's not a good bonus

1072
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:20,940
wait but here's the thing I'm trying to

1073
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,500
figure out whether or not I had

1074
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,210
something that can boost it because

1075
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:27,449
apparently sorcerers have a bunch of

1076
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:29,490
weird spell mod business they've all

1077
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:31,439
kinds of rich [ __ ] yeah green I don't

1078
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:33,868
know I don't know that I have that no no

the nails are coming out of the green

1143
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:37,729
off now okay for a moment I just want to

1144
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:40,909
talk and know his reactions to you even

1145
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:43,699
being near the focus is nothing like how

1146
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:46,429
I win when I tried to get him out of the

1147
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:48,228
cave when he was just like I got near

1148
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:50,419
him and his eyes were like [ __ ] he

1149
00:54:48,228 --> 00:54:52,399
attacked me twice yeah energy attack

1150
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,048
like this is not I know I know I'm

1151
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,150
metagaming this a little bit but this is

1152
00:54:54,048 --> 00:54:57,440
not good the rest is all right that's

1153
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:59,719
right I could tell something was wrong

1154
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,519
with walnut even when we walked into the

1155
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:02,838
city later she had a little lunar I get

1156
00:55:01,518 --> 00:55:05,028
anyone's perceptive about people's

1157
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:07,338
emotions I think it's racing I'm an

1158
00:55:05,028 --> 00:55:09,798
impact I think an hour just like item I

1159
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:13,639
know like it takes your share yeah way

1160
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:16,940
okay that yeah Devine wouldn't have that

1161
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:18,440
background right that I would that just

1162
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,509
goes nuts rain do something with it

1163
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,849
really touches on you okay so I'm

1164
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:24,739
suspicious at this point of what

1165
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:27,798
whatever the [ __ ] going on here this

1166
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:29,960
is out of character forest but I don't

1167
00:55:27,798 --> 00:55:31,369
know what I like what conclusion I would

1168
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,099
draw about that right I just know

1169
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:35,539
there's something very very amiss

1170
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:38,329
taking his thing lighting on fire and

1171
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:42,170
smushy shows his face I feel like Ali

1172
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:43,818
yeah I feel like I was like side with

1173
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:46,278
him though I feel like that's kind of

1174
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:48,139
messed up I feel like that's there okay

1175
00:55:46,278 --> 00:55:50,150
can I ask you a question that's sort of

1176
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:50,920
an tied to being Carol I think it bears

1177
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:54,250
saying because I

1178
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:56,619
what I want to do yeah like this the

1179
00:55:54,250 --> 00:56:00,190
focus is basically a hunk of obsidian

1180
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:03,160
yeah right that's been heated it has

1181
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:06,760
this carving on a superheated yeah am I

1182
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:08,828
going to end up like you know tote from

1183
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,319
eating of the Jones and I got it seared

1184
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:13,900
into me here or here yeah and if there

1185
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:18,460
happens does it have an effect on me

1186
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:20,650
being a mammoth person i I like all this

1187
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:23,500
stuff so basically you superheated this

1188
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:28,358
rock it has a symbol on maybe earth so

1189
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:29,170
much I should marry yeah I think hey I

1190
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:31,659
have an idea

1191
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:34,000
cool we're still early but I ate on our

1192
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:36,420
leaf yeah I hear one more Sunday night

1193
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,190
right yeah I buy this by this point your

1194
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:41,619
that your hand is covered in symbols

1195
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:44,380
just from different like trying

1196
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:47,380
different ways to grasp it the hot chain

1197
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:49,960
is seared on the right hand on your

1198
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:53,858
cheek symbols of the ER and MELAS have

1199
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:56,500
sort of come in gold in a massive sort

1200
00:56:53,858 --> 00:57:00,699
of scarification I like that on the left

1201
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,710
side okay very tight shame to meet your

1202
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:04,298

00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,119
I don't think that I want yeah hey I

1256
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,710
would come into a city that they have to

1257
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:11,990
do a job and have a public fight in the

1258
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:15,139
street yeah I don't like public displays

1259
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:17,479

singers Cal naked in a Christian body I

1271
00:59:44,088 --> 00:59:47,328
think you guys are going first because

1272
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:49,730
you're being ushered down by Bernard

1273
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:51,950
yeah you gotta bear behind me yeah and I

1274
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:54,079
just kind of like yeah my professor here

1275
00:59:51,949 --> 00:59:56,000

now now you probably already read about

1279
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,599
this but like

1280
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:08,730
I hide the buying be foolish not to let

1281
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:10,440
me go over sled but yeah yeah let's

1282
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:14,190
let's go proceed because there's a

1283
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,230
reason why I can't do that did you have

1284
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:19,079
any when I was stripping it naked did I

1285
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,650
hide income or something no I don't

1286
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,969
think so

1287
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:25,980
no stage making so in you okay

1288
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:27,899
serpent taking the exam I call that I

1289
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:30,329
would youth you've seen it you can use

1290
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:34,858
them as you enter this as you enter this

1291
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:37,889
realm you can see there's like this was

1292
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:39,719
a hard packed earth of the cellar it

1293
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:41,759
sort of crumbled and broken screens

1294
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:45,689
right where they're exactly where the

1295
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:48,810
rats had emerged you can also see if

1296
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:51,960
you're careful you can see the Rings

1297
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:55,679
where these rings of moonlight have sort

1298
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:58,019
of been dragged around in Donbass yeah

1299
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,000
exactly yeah but there is no body here

job well done and then cable sticks of

1320
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:41,280
course there else was I gonna go good

1321
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:43,560
work in I point I want to just be like

1322
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:48,599
okay Walter you gotta want to do this

1323
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:50,909
maybe um where she goes uh you had it

1324
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:52,740
under control I went into the alley both

1325
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:54,210
of you saw me leave at which point I was

1326
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:58,289
attacked by a cultist

1327
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:59,970
of some kind this is what we should be

1328
01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:03,059
talking about that was the body of it

1329
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:07,829
right and then when you came out your

1330
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:11,989
focus summoned the knife into itself and

1331
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:14,789
absorbed it Solent a dead bodies knife

1332
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:16,389
flew out of its hands and went into your

1333
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:19,659
focus

1334
01:02:16,389 --> 01:02:20,500
- the focus product of listening yeah

1335
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:23,078
okay

1336
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:27,159
you didn't go into the focus I pull out

1337
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:32,250
the other dagger that is mine oh my god

1338
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:34,690
it merely retrieved it for me hmm

1339
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,818
someone looks like that's not true I I

1340
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:39,190
saw it going to the focus I look at my

1341
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:41,920
family you have to trust me here to

1342
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:45,670
dress me I think this will be invaluable

1343
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,170
for my for my studies and this dagger is

1344
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:49,829
the same one that has the symbol the

1345
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:52,690
hated symbol on it right oh yeah yeah

1346
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:55,180
did it did it like reflect yeah yeah on

1347
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:59,470
there yeah three on the knife and then I

1348
01:02:55,179 --> 01:03:02,018
I look at it for this point and I look

1349
01:02:59,469 --> 01:03:03,909
at that symbol and I go I go I can't

1350
01:03:02,018 --> 01:03:06,909
explain now but you need to know that

1351
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:07,899
that symbol means that he's I don't know

1352
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:12,699
what's going on with him but he's not

1353
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:15,519
with us I had that vibe since the cave

1354
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:18,268
next to know what yeah on this we may

1355
01:03:15,518 --> 01:03:18,268
reach agree yeah

1356
01:03:18,809 --> 01:03:26,109
that cave whether your rough situation

1357
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:27,220
yeah no she really what do we do oh yeah

1358
01:03:26,108 --> 01:03:29,469
like do better

1359
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:31,899
yes getting it giving it you're sorry

1360
01:03:29,469 --> 01:03:35,038
it's like a whole map of what I should

1361
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:36,639
have done from the whole jurisdiction

1362
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,599
okay okay

1363
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:42,548
so at this point that accusation your

1364
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:44,619
support of it about the cave and my

1365
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:46,869
observation that he was reacting very

1366
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:49,390
weirdly to his focus makes me want to

1367
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:52,119
bust out some grandma man see hmm yeah

1368
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:54,548
and ascertain some [ __ ] truth yeah

1369
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:55,170
that sound good to you he okay I'm gonna

1370
01:03:54,548 --> 01:03:57,788
do it

1371
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:00,700
nothing it's not truthful what do you

1372
01:03:57,789 --> 01:04:04,990
say RP it uh well okay so grown man seat

1373
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:06,669
is up in the air is exactly but but we

1374
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:11,459
talked about it before the game and you

1375
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:15,818
like the idea as do i that rosie has

1376
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:18,849
just a capacity from hundreds of years

1377
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:21,489
of gret of grandmother thousands exactly

1378
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:23,769
just to like auger right into someone

1379
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:25,439
right and figure out a secret about them

1380
01:04:23,768 --> 01:04:27,548
yeah okay

1381
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,720
this is going to be very useful for us

1382
01:04:27,548 --> 01:04:33,050
to gosh alright

1383
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:36,079
let's see how quickly I can ascertain an

1384
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:37,970
actual secret well you have do you get

1385
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,969
to determine the secret or does the risk

1386
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:42,679
being ordinarily in ordinarily you

1387
01:04:40,969 --> 01:04:44,509
wouldn't be using this on a party member

1388
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:46,429
you know what I mean yeah we even show

1389
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:48,110
you a lot of [ __ ] on each other no exact

1390
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:51,379
today's accident and I'm told that

1391
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:53,599
doesn't happen there being my first

1392
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,140
foray into D&amp;D I'm like this is all

1393
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,630
normal

1394
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:57,440
yeah emails like don't now I like this

1395
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,840
with different groups

1396
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,099
yeah paradigm but no in this case a

1397
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,980
ordinarily this is going to be used

1398
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:05,809
against NPC right and but right now

1399
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:09,320
right now this is a player character

1400
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:10,699
okay while you determine I suppose the

1401
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,950
secret that you're going to tell me I

1402
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:16,219
will be some build another Lane yos vamp

1403
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:21,889
uh give me a moment guys good there's

1404
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:24,259
drought yeah uh what what is going on

1405
01:05:21,889 --> 01:05:30,309
how what is this focus what is your deal

1406
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:32,540
I I want to know tell me exactly why

1407
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:37,039
everything has happened the way it has

1408
01:05:32,539 --> 01:05:39,590
I'm trying to learn that myself my focus

1409
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:43,059
works in ways that I don't necessarily

1410
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:43,059
understand where did it come from

1411
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,559
thank you you see what she she would

1412
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,230
have no way to know

1413
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,960
I'll let she had some insight though I

1414
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:56,990
it was a part of an altar that I am an

1415
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:59,440
altar yes we're a destroyed altar in the

1416
01:05:56,989 --> 01:06:02,869
Underdark obviously hmm interesting

1417
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:06,800
this sound like [ __ ] to me a lot of

1418
01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:09,199
weird stuff goes on yeah but Devine

1419
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:11,330
would have seen this shape on her altar

1420
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:14,299
indeed so that's probably where all that

1421
01:06:11,329 --> 01:06:18,289
out very specific yes okay alright and

1422
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:22,670
what does this symbol mean that I don't

1423
01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:25,250
know either but that's good time it's my

1424
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:28,130
task in life to figure it out I'm pretty

1425
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:29,019
sure he's told us the name before the

1426
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,700
earth yeah

1427
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:33,409
I think he said that out loud before I

1428
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:35,480
don't think that I want to put it I

1429
01:06:33,409 --> 01:06:38,329
think I wouldn't had cause to say it all

1430

since we've got here

1440
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:07,568
that is the precipitating factor through

1441
01:07:04,269 --> 01:07:10,119
all of this and I'm being set of blades

1442
01:07:07,568 --> 01:07:14,650
and being brought back down in this

1443
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:17,170
rathole I I don't understand I've gone

1444
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:20,410
through so much today I understand I

1445
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:22,900
just just one more question there's

1446
01:07:20,409 --> 01:07:28,779
there's there's something that I just

1447
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:33,369

1448
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:35,260
me yeah yeah hey Mason I get it I you

1449
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:40,690
and I entire conversation before where

1450
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:42,270
we we've had we've compared certain

1451
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:45,550
aspects of our childhood to each other

1452
01:07:42,269 --> 01:07:49,780
you remember that conversation but

1453
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:52,839
because that that to me is how I know I

1454
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:56,050
trust you because we were able to to

1455
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:59,619
connect on this level you remember what

1456
01:07:56,050 --> 01:08:03,550
that was rough one

1457
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:05,769
hmm to roleplay good because she

1458
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:06,339
wouldn't know there was having some

1459
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:11,289
trust issues

1460
01:08:06,338 --> 01:08:17,399
right yeah you guys about ten seconds no

1461
01:08:11,289 --> 01:08:21,519

1463
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:29,199

1469
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:45,310

01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:07,550
that Rosie you should try to stop this

1614
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:08,720

1621
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:27,829
master when it hits any melee attack

1622
01:15:23,569 --> 01:15:30,319
that you do that round yeah is a d8

1623
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:32,670
instead of a d4 right and so on turns

1624
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,769
where you dump a key point in mhm

1625
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:37,739
you just to do this flurry like that's a

1626
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:39,179
lot 3d 8 plus for each time I'm just

1627
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:42,238
saying it's something to consider

1628
01:15:39,179 --> 01:15:44,039
okay I felt I felt bad like I hadn't

1629
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:45,389
explained it and so I just want to make

1630
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,859
sure you know you have that in your I'm

1631
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:49,140
going to do it I'm going to give her all

1632
01:15:46,859 --> 01:15:52,019
kinds of punches and kicks okay so

1633
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:56,429
strikes with the core stuff which is

1634
01:15:52,020 --> 01:16:01,320
going to be a nine and then I will do

1635
01:15:56,429 --> 01:16:02,850
two on arm strikes that's two anyway I'm

1636
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:03,719
going to I'm going to go for the backs

1637
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,480
of the knees

1638
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:12,448
Wow try to hamstring a little bit that

1639
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:15,629
is a hit and that's another seven and

1640
01:16:12,448 --> 01:16:17,879
that's I it sticking forward to me you

1641
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:20,730
don't you need yeah below zero let me

1642
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:23,250
know yeah yum yum yum I'm a minus one

1643
01:16:20,729 --> 01:16:26,839
yeah the staff of the master whips out

1644
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:30,179
he's defending and made a murder correct

1645
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:31,860
anyway is Chris right I was your friend

1646
01:16:30,179 --> 01:16:33,719
and I don't think you had that few hit

1647
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:35,189
points like you're good with something

1648
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:39,390
have a few this is the first around

1649
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:42,029
behind yeah we only do that I didn't

1650
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:43,530
mean Oh live and once he loses

1651
01:16:42,029 --> 01:16:47,000
consciousness what happens to the

1652
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:49,710
shape-shifting I think that I think that

1653
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,488
there's probably different ways to

1654
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:57,319
interpret the end result of that what I

1655
01:16:53,488 --> 01:16:59,869
am going to say is that as soon as

1656
01:16:57,319 --> 01:17:05,639
Devine loses consciousness

1657
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:08,460
you see Chris's black hair sort of like

1658
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:11,940
burst out in the back and change color

1659
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:17,670
you see horns erupt from the sides of

1660
01:17:11,939 --> 01:17:20,178
the skull right on the stairs just like

1661
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:22,380
falling forward is completely out and

1662
01:17:20,179 --> 01:17:27,420
unconscious and you can see that you can

1663
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:29,029
see the focus on the chain like pulling

1664
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:32,810
itself on the ground

1665
01:17:29,029 --> 01:17:37,948
mm-hmm like like putting like and it

1666
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:41,550
drags the body on it ragdoll physics

1667
01:17:37,948 --> 01:17:43,919
yeah like like she goes down and then

1668
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:45,739
immediately it starts to crawl I imagine

1669
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,929
like a truck

1670
01:17:45,738 --> 01:17:51,098
attached to something with a hitch right

1671
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:57,649
like this thing is crawling and rolling

1672
01:17:51,099 --> 01:18:07,460
dragging her around like slicks yes hmm

1673
01:17:57,649 --> 01:18:09,799
and it pulls over to the rough soil at

1674
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:12,529
the edge of the rats had previously sort

1675
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:15,110
of pushed through and you can see it

1676
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:20,779
like almost like scraping and scratching

1677
01:18:15,109 --> 01:18:25,038
at the dirt oh [ __ ] hmm all right the

1678
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:27,408
focus being your oh you're okay good

1679
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:30,349
fine yeah run over and say that would

1680
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:31,969
drive you crazy right like the hood that

1681
01:18:30,349 --> 01:18:33,078
thinks they're swarming around yeah I'm

1682
01:18:31,969 --> 01:18:35,559

1683
01:18:33,078 --> 01:18:38,719
encouraging our please yeah come help me

1684
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:40,998

01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:48,828
eating whatever you always know whenever

1688
01:18:45,769 --> 01:18:52,159
you reach down for it it's always blade

1689
01:18:48,828 --> 01:18:54,710

like gritting my teeth and I grab it I'm

1692
01:18:58,219 --> 01:19:01,730

yeah that's for the emotional damages

1697
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:11,118
but it's a good imagine if you'd imagine

1698
01:19:09,738 --> 01:19:13,488
that it's like a sort of a weeble type

1699
01:19:11,118 --> 01:19:16,609
scenario like no matter which way you're

1700
01:19:13,488 --> 01:19:17,448
reaching for it it's always pointed at

1701
01:19:16,609 --> 01:19:19,219
you with anger

1702
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:22,308

yeah I was suspicious at the very start

1781
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:07,328
we were in a in and it never went away

1782
01:23:05,948 --> 01:23:08,978
and now it's only going up and up and

1783
01:23:07,328 --> 01:23:11,429
now you can any of you could be anyone

1784
01:23:08,979 --> 01:23:14,199
else with any moment can't open doors no

1785
01:23:11,429 --> 01:23:16,599
I'm just like my paranoia is reaching

1786
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:20,109
like logically it's gotten ranked up but

1787
01:23:16,599 --> 01:23:21,998
you see you know your your cloak yeah I

1788
01:23:20,109 --> 01:23:24,788
mean you you are basically all of your

1789
01:23:21,998 --> 01:23:28,510
best coolest garb everything that's

1790
01:23:24,788 --> 01:23:31,569
associated with your IP is draped orient

1791
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:34,479
is draped around to Devine I cover

1792
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:37,418
yourself up ice ice cream because I

1793
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:43,239
remember suddenly ah the night-sun Oh

1794
01:23:37,418 --> 01:23:45,130
ah no dinar my name Waldo you've met the

1795
01:23:43,238 --> 01:23:46,658
moon why are you sleeping in dirt you're

1796
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:50,189
supposed to be killing Rhett I don't

1797
01:23:46,658 --> 01:23:52,899
know alright fair enough it's just this

1798
01:23:50,189 --> 01:23:56,409
no it's her thank you

1799
01:23:52,899 --> 01:24:00,759
and so so that it is able it rolls the

1800
01:23:56,408 --> 01:24:05,788
focus twists and rolls itself over the

1801
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:11,530
horns yeah and then like a faithful dog

1802
01:24:05,788 --> 01:24:15,578
um roles roles to your foot and begins

1803
01:24:11,529 --> 01:24:18,340
to snake its way up there naked right

1804
01:24:15,578 --> 01:24:20,228
yeah there's usually a phrase like all

1805
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:24,110
three guys you're guilty but really

1806
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:26,720
nothing he is it is just Chris Brown

1807
01:24:24,109 --> 01:24:28,639
with me altogether this is like this is

1808
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:31,820
like one of the shots from the Capri

1809
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:35,030
strobe under dark after dark calendar

1810
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:38,389
and also he's murdered with just what

1811
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:38,899
the earth is like 30 it goes around my

1812
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:40,850
waist

1813
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:43,460
and then just as a fig leaf yeah yeah

1814
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:46,130
yeah I think I felt like jab dagger does

1815
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:49,760
not yeah why are y'all road hog and it

1816
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:51,890
can't be apart from the focus so it's

1817
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,780
trying to go it is trying to pull itself

1818
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:56,380
out and so you are anything and it is in

1819
01:24:53,779 --> 01:24:58,340
midair and you are continuing to hold it

1820
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:59,900
imagine that it's almost like it wants

1821
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:01,819
like you want it to be stationary

1822
01:24:59,899 --> 01:25:03,379
doesn't but you have to almost like

1823
01:25:01,819 --> 01:25:05,750
you're pulling a rope but it's just a

1824
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:07,100
single dagger and I'm in the mid air I

1825
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:08,479
mean are you continuing to hold like

1826
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:11,329

1827
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:13,639

edge of so that he could see the because

01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:35,750
it's mirrored so you'd see the symbol

1839
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:37,640
that's on it also I can see that yeah

1840
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:39,199
you can even try to hold it so that he

1841
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,240
sees the icon of my lips yeah for like

1842
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:43,309
one second and once he sees that knee

01:26:17,329 --> 01:26:24,319
they are we're actually saying I hit

1859
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:27,619
they strike it and then are drawn in

1860
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:31,609

easy TV yeah um no okay that was like

1878
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:17,569
the first thing I thought it I am

1879
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:19,339
rotating or picking over the body of

1880
01:27:17,569 --> 01:27:21,739
Devine to try to figure out what if

1881
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:24,500

but I mean the only like the real

1885
01:27:28,579 --> 01:27:37,309
standout item the the main point of

1886
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:42,219
commonality is that that she had exactly

1887
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:44,420
the same dagger as this ally assassin

1888
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:46,699
okay but I don't know about the ally

1889
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:48,800

what would those knives want with my

1915
01:28:54,918 --> 01:29:04,340

01:37:43,939 --> 01:37:48,269
everything's fine you got your preacher

2130
01:37:46,619 --> 01:37:51,180
of nice rock it's fine

2131
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:52,950
you got your cool now right like your

2132
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:55,890
your rock is not fine

2133
01:37:52,949 --> 01:37:57,899
Sean's rock it's not a high percent fine

2134
01:37:55,890 --> 01:38:01,440
I'm checking the rock out there smell is

2135
01:37:57,899 --> 01:38:03,329
definitely that of the smells new smell

2136
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:06,689
there's an idiot you have that you have

2137
01:38:03,329 --> 01:38:09,529
that we have a new focus smell but

2138
01:38:06,689 --> 01:38:16,679
that's you're like a Cajun little Irish

2139
01:38:09,529 --> 01:38:27,210
yeah it was a 20 I can't count it I

2140
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:29,850
think I could count no 12 almost 20 it

2141
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:34,619
has it has a smell

2142
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:40,890
it's commingled with the original sort

2143
01:38:34,619 --> 01:38:43,229
of primeval must right um a whole new

2144
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:47,070
smell yeah exactly yeah anyone else

2145
01:38:43,229 --> 01:38:52,949
would hate it if now if now commingled

2146
01:38:47,069 --> 01:38:55,769
with like the scent of wet leaves wet

2147
01:38:52,949 --> 01:38:57,869
leaves you say hmm yeah and there is

2148
01:38:55,770 --> 01:39:00,930
there is actually another symbol light

2149
01:38:57,869 --> 01:39:02,970
soil of it law on it yeah it's visible

2150
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:05,369
at all times it is visible at all times

2151
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:06,869
but it's still very dim it's only when

2152
01:39:05,369 --> 01:39:09,619
it catches the light that you can see it

2153
01:39:06,869 --> 01:39:12,599
but it is the mark is clearly upon the

2154
01:39:09,619 --> 01:39:15,359
focus what is it it is the icon of

2155
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,620
Mahlon yeah those are how I'm little

2156
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:19,500
refresher this guy

2157
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:24,090
sea turtles the whispering I are on a 11

2158
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:27,079
yes evil exact thing exactly but but so

2159
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:30,690
you've seen it and this the focus is

2160
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:33,059
sequestering these daggers somehow like

2161
01:39:30,689 --> 01:39:37,049
it's let's not shoot them out at us way

2162
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:40,080
yeah it's collecting them the focus has

2163
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:41,520
changed that smell is one of the things

2164
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:43,229
that like reminded me of the under

2165
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,780
darken head and that night when I found

2166
01:39:43,229 --> 01:39:47,809
it yeah I think isn't weird are you over

2167
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:49,979
to you focus focus

2168
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:52,980
under spike

2169
01:39:49,979 --> 01:39:54,000
two boys are you assuming you're

2170
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:56,339
connected from the arena

2171
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,289
yeah you can you can I'm searching for

2172
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:00,840
the words okay well so while you're

2173
01:39:58,289 --> 01:40:02,579
doing that and I go listen I don't know

2174
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:04,920
why you can understand what that you

2175
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:07,409
know he's going to recognize this symbol

2176
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:11,899
but you should know that it's bad and

2177
01:40:07,409 --> 01:40:19,399
it's wrong we got to get rid of it I

2178
01:40:11,899 --> 01:40:23,849
don't know what this is but thank you

2179
01:40:19,399 --> 01:40:25,229
because this would happen otherwise you

2180
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:30,630
may have brought me a little bit closer

2181
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:32,129
to a truth oh come on screws you're

2182
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:33,750
welcome and you remember last session

2183
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:38,310
like I said what was the second person

2184
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:40,920
right but that's well yeah I think it's

2185
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:42,750
heartfelt but I'm like you you might

2186
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:47,460
have brought me closer to unleashing

2187
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:49,770
whatever this is well my guess along

2188
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:51,810
looks just like it realizes that what

2189
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:54,210
she's saying is just like not piercing

2190
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:55,500
the same reality that like if you're not

2191
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:57,899
living in the same thing I wouldn't

2192
01:40:55,500 --> 01:41:01,470
leave Leo alone and I'm looking at it

2193
01:40:57,899 --> 01:41:03,719
looking at the new symbol like I think

2194
01:41:01,470 --> 01:41:06,510
that's cool I get used to that this

2195
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:09,510
scent is important now before it was

2196
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:11,730
just a one piece of the puzzle and it

2197
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:16,320
started to draw the token itself into

2198
01:41:11,729 --> 01:41:18,029
itself and actually two-in-one this one

2199
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:19,380
it's waving to the right I got to give

2200
01:41:18,029 --> 01:41:21,750
it two kisses every time now

2201
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:25,050
No so you don't think that lucky Rock

2202
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:27,750
did your symbol I don't know what its

2203
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:31,020
aim is yet but if that's something that

2204
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:33,300
it that it needed I was going to give it

2205
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:38,070
that space I think at this point on the

2206
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:39,840
grill a little bit of a I think at this

2207
01:41:38,069 --> 01:41:42,479
point she might actually reveal like

2208
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:46,829
pretty-pretty what her context is for it

2209
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:49,799
not in so much debt so I can't write the

2210
01:41:46,829 --> 01:41:52,500
symbol can you say the name no you can

2211
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,779
say to me okay if you want to maybe it

2212
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:56,488
would have been anything but I think

2213
01:41:53,779 --> 01:41:58,289
that's and all another way if you call

2214
01:41:56,488 --> 01:42:00,689
it like the hated machine who betrayed

2215
01:41:58,289 --> 01:42:03,170
you okay I was like that's a mobile on

2216
01:42:00,689 --> 01:42:06,819
sushi who betrays like unless

2217
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:10,969
serve she betrays that's not your symbol

2218
01:42:06,819 --> 01:42:16,279
here that because that symbol that's

2219
01:42:10,969 --> 01:42:17,929
what it does it it gets places that it

2220
01:42:16,279 --> 01:42:18,469
shouldn't be and it shouldn't ever be

2221
01:42:17,929 --> 01:42:21,429
written

2222
01:42:18,469 --> 01:42:25,579
well now you hear you with you always I

2223
01:42:21,429 --> 01:42:29,050
don't like that less I don't hate it

2224
01:42:25,579 --> 01:42:31,579
though no I like it I like it less

2225
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:34,719
that's originally picking up some what's

2226
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:37,130
going down here yeah so this symbol is a

2227
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:37,460
something that I can see it doesn't bug

2228
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:40,969
me

2229
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:46,000
can I perceive it the shapen again on

2230
01:42:40,969 --> 01:42:49,060
the on one of the sort of impossible

2231
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,250
indescribable phases of this geometry

2232
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:53,539
it's plain as day okay have I seen it

2233
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:53,960
anywhere else in the city since we've

2234
01:42:53,539 --> 01:42:56,600
been here

2235
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:58,189
no maybe you're like like I got like

2236
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:01,010
graffiti or something like that sure

2237
01:42:58,189 --> 01:43:03,738
Nelson no no like carving me with rules

2238
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:05,600
yeah yeah yeah um is it something that I

2239
01:43:03,738 --> 01:43:07,849
was canoeing history check on you be

2240
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:10,910
familiar with her no this is this is not

2241
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:13,429
human history I'm not human yeah yeah

2242
01:43:10,909 --> 01:43:18,559
this is not this is not the type of

2243
01:43:13,429 --> 01:43:19,010
story people tell um all right and same

2244
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,929
boat

2245
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:22,310
well like when refresh my memory so when

2246
01:43:20,929 --> 01:43:24,230
we were down in the cave and you were

2247
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:25,610
going crazy the symbols were appearing

2248
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:27,439
on the gate did we see some others it

2249
01:43:25,609 --> 01:43:29,599
just he seen uh no use you can see it

2250
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:31,969
though there so they're very visual but

2251
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,350
the difference right is that he can see

2252
01:43:31,969 --> 01:43:35,960
a symbol and know what it means

2253
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:37,699
yeah yeah right so the entire cave was

2254
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:39,649
lousy with all kinds of symbols but I

2255
01:43:37,698 --> 01:43:41,448
knew my symbol and then you knew that

2256
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:43,429
symbol but all I know of it is that it

2257
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:45,649
bothered you for writing to bother you

2258
01:43:43,429 --> 01:43:47,600
that around you're correct and now you

2259
01:43:45,649 --> 01:43:49,819
have some curve but but no but now you

2260
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,100
have some more context for it right now

2261
01:43:49,819 --> 01:43:55,448
you know it's correlated in some way

2262
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:59,660
with DES Riddick lore right yeah

2263
01:43:55,448 --> 01:44:01,759
well sir the difference okay all right

2264
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:03,079
yeah can we yeah let's get let's just

2265
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,760
like complete our mission and get the

2266
01:44:03,079 --> 01:44:06,920
hell out of their city location - yeah

2267
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:10,039
yes but I don't ever as we're walking

2268
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:13,779
littke thrissoor find me okay that's

2269
01:44:10,039 --> 01:44:16,409
fair vocally tell them I hate in every

2270
01:44:13,779 --> 01:44:20,509
stand differences Isaac I want

2271
01:44:16,409 --> 01:44:20,510
five you like I think that's wise

2272
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:28,980
absolutely so it's plain as day on your

2273
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:34,380
scroll document sir you know precisely

2274
01:44:28,979 --> 01:44:38,309
where the next venue is I do it is north

2275
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:41,250
so beneath this great mound that exists

2276
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:43,620
in the center of this town you can see

2277
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:46,789
almost like a way out that train tunnel

2278
01:44:43,619 --> 01:44:49,409
might be carved there is a main road

2279
01:44:46,789 --> 01:44:52,079
that exists that travels through the

2280
01:44:49,409 --> 01:44:54,750
center of it but even even inside this

2281
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:56,789
it isn't it's all useful space there are

2282
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:58,770
little shops hammocks

2283
01:44:56,789 --> 01:45:01,739
there's zero hammocks around your

2284
01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:03,840
hammock district okay I mean right here

2285
01:45:01,739 --> 01:45:09,439
in TripAdvisor it says you're visiting

2286
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,440
NEMA's are you gotta go I'm gonna kill

2287
01:45:09,619 --> 01:45:15,539
anybody on a deep Candida it says 2-0

2288
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:18,270
does it not give it to me cuz I might

2289
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:19,649
exhibit a needed but he does not like to

2290
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:21,030
be separated from sight I might need to

2291
01:45:19,649 --> 01:45:23,750
be put I might need to put it in your

2292
01:45:21,029 --> 01:45:28,439
esophagus later I thought oh good yeah

2293
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:30,630
there aren't any hammocks feelings but

2294
01:45:28,439 --> 01:45:32,219
you can see that this stone has worked

2295
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:35,940
and they've sort of carved shops and

2296
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:38,280
serve it right to make this this block

2297
01:45:35,939 --> 01:45:40,169
as useful as possible and I hate this

2298
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:42,899
store and I think I just don't like that

2299
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:44,850
or would not enter into that stores

2300
01:45:42,899 --> 01:45:47,189
loyalty program having a punch card of

2301
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:51,030
this store you analyst souvenir shop

2305
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:01,110
murderer can't write it so exactly so

2306
01:45:59,550 --> 01:46:03,480
actually I'm sorry any merchants and

2307
01:46:01,109 --> 01:46:05,039
merchandise I will have to burn yes he

2308
01:46:03,479 --> 01:46:07,739
actually made me less merchandise I

2309
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:12,750
burned it exactly it was a huge loss

2310
01:46:07,739 --> 01:46:16,469
yeah so what you see that it's sort of

2311
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:19,260
the northeastern corner of this you can

2312
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:20,310
see that the walls the exterior walls of

2313
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:22,619
the city itself

2314
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:26,400
sort of join up near the north of the

2315
01:46:22,619 --> 01:46:29,488
city but sort of nestled in that little

2316
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:32,748
crook there near the top is a

2317
01:46:29,488 --> 01:46:34,529
tower that has the face of a clock on it

2318
01:46:32,748 --> 01:46:38,429
so a clock tower

2319
01:46:34,529 --> 01:46:40,649
exactly you don't think it it doesn't

2320
01:46:38,429 --> 01:46:42,599
you're not you don't think that's a time

2321
01:46:40,649 --> 01:46:46,379
that is on there it is referencing the

2322
01:46:42,599 --> 01:46:49,739
real time times it is outside it has

2323
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:51,689
like half of one hand okay and like it

2324
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:54,509
hasn't service it's not an operation

2325
01:46:51,689 --> 01:46:56,880
they didn't photograph you can be reps

2327
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:01,439
exactly but this is the they're the

2328
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:03,538
enemies who is their natural enemy yeah

2329
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:07,860
kind of the enemy of the past I think

2330
01:47:03,538 --> 01:47:09,569
he's the fastest time and I reckon

2331
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:11,908
you're this whole campaign is going to

2332
01:47:09,569 --> 01:47:14,969

you see a window higher up in the

2374
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:34,139
rickety structure thrown open and you

2375
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:35,670
see a platinum scaled Dragonborn high up

2376
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:40,440
he's thrown over the window and he says

2377
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:46,909

2383
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:07,920
he closes this window and the doors at

2384
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:09,900
the base open and allow you access you

2385
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:12,810

could you not and we go so that you you

2388
01:50:17,609 --> 01:50:23,759
feel like the lower floors sort of you

2389
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:27,360
can see some rough shelving and things

2390
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:29,310
like that you feel like rats have

2391
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:33,869
started at the bottom of this tower

2392
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:37,610
another here yeah they started from the

2393
01:50:33,869 --> 01:50:37,609
bottom now the whole town [ __ ] here

2394
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:45,780
correct but you can tell that they have

2395
01:50:41,789 --> 01:50:49,859
they have had their way with virtually

2396
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:50,399
every had every edible thing down here

2397
01:50:49,859 --> 01:50:52,609
hmm

2398
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:55,039
sure you know I'm talking about mm-hmm

2399
01:50:52,609 --> 01:50:58,759
deep breath

2400
01:50:55,039 --> 01:51:03,140
yeah yeah the rest hey so um but you can

2401
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:08,810
be any Brad chakra difference is the

2402
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:11,150
first we never apologize very bad so

2403
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:14,150
these these stairs in the same way that

2404
01:51:11,149 --> 01:51:18,829
coriander is barely a horse like these

2405
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:20,960
barely constitute anything that you

2406
01:51:18,829 --> 01:51:25,279
would want to walk on by choice

2407
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:28,909
rats have gone nuts on these as well you

2408
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:33,789
pass up through the the middle tier of

2409
01:51:28,909 --> 01:51:36,489
this and you see various alchemical

2410
01:51:33,789 --> 01:51:41,269
apparatus

2411
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:43,819
many of them broken vials without

2412
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:47,240
stoppers throwing us thrown to the side

2413
01:51:43,819 --> 01:51:48,739
I just note to myself there's got to be

2414
01:51:47,239 --> 01:51:50,269
some kind of health code violation I'm

2415
01:51:48,739 --> 01:51:51,409
wondering that reform for yeah it's

2416
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:54,170
almost perfect

2417
01:51:51,409 --> 01:51:56,359
almost certainly workers comp together

2418
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:58,190
so I'm a little like thanks for saving

2419
01:51:56,359 --> 01:52:00,739
this place for me yeah it didn't heaven

2420
01:51:58,189 --> 01:52:05,569
over here like this yeah you you

2421
01:52:00,739 --> 01:52:08,899
approach the third and final tier of the

2422
01:52:05,569 --> 01:52:10,489
venue and these things appear to be this

2423
01:52:08,899 --> 01:52:13,819
appears to be a functional laboratory

2424
01:52:10,489 --> 01:52:18,109
you can see that that you know beyond

2425
01:52:13,819 --> 01:52:24,099
all you know all that the lower floors

2426
01:52:18,109 --> 01:52:27,380
would indicate many of these jars and

2427
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:29,810
flasks contain liquids which you feel

2428
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:30,529
like is going to be the baseline for any

2429
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:32,810
alchemist

2430
01:52:30,529 --> 01:52:34,189
you know what I mean like this is this

2431
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:37,520
is where an alchemist would do some

2432
01:52:34,189 --> 01:52:41,419
[ __ ] alchemy [ __ ] oh yeah 100% wall to

2433
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:44,450
wall it's the idea least eight different

2434
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:46,489
pests it's the IKEA of alchemy you can

2435
01:52:44,449 --> 01:52:48,500
see a lot of a lot of materials there

2436
01:52:46,489 --> 01:52:51,769
and you get and you can see how as you

2437
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:54,909
can see Hallie act moving around kata ya

2438
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:58,490
know you can you can see a Hallie AK

2439
01:52:54,909 --> 01:53:00,769
sort of moving around from bigger to

2440
01:52:58,489 --> 01:53:02,179
beaker making mild adjustments in terms

2441
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:06,199
of temperature

2442
01:53:02,179 --> 01:53:09,679
whispering occasionally to them he has a

2443
01:53:06,198 --> 01:53:12,049
process and he likes it and then without

2444
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:14,569

2549
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:18,220
might have had the the giant potion do

2550
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:21,940
they have like an expiration on them

2551
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:23,860
should we come back after that yeah like

2552
01:59:21,939 --> 01:59:27,099
like a last we're 10 minutes per round

2553
01:59:23,859 --> 01:59:31,299
per caster level or something they had a

2554
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:34,510
lot and I thought it would be over by

2555
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:36,039
now so those are good potions do you

2556
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:36,640

01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:42,970
that good good potions is like I lost

01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:48,100
my entire stock I'm in the process of

2560
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:50,079
making more now how long will it be like

2561
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:51,250
five minutes ten minutes he goes back

2562
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:54,090
and starts looking at all the potions

2563
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:58,420
and just gets completely lost him

2564
01:59:54,090 --> 02:00:00,640

01:59:58,420 --> 02:00:03,789

02:00:32,619 --> 02:00:36,489
a girl needs me like the help myself

2581
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:42,640

quick pass hmm not Natalie exactly two

2588
02:00:54,310 --> 02:01:04,000
quick passes got good legs if you could

2589
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:09,579
tip if this is thicker than a health

2590
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:11,319
potion generally is I'm not sure that

2591
02:01:09,579 --> 02:01:13,600
any of the ingredients in this potion

2592
02:01:11,319 --> 02:01:15,909
would be shared with a health potion

2593
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:21,930
mmm-hmm I think this is not a health

2594
02:01:15,909 --> 02:01:21,930
potion you know what it might be well

2595
02:01:23,130 --> 02:01:30,400
grab a rat and of course they do Rasmus

2596
02:01:27,789 --> 02:01:37,109
is portion of incident rat yes exactly

2597
02:01:30,399 --> 02:01:40,269
so you see um you're not gonna let him

2598
02:01:37,109 --> 02:01:45,339
take it he's not trying to drink it okay

2599
02:01:40,270 --> 02:01:46,840
my god no no try to find out okay you

2600
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:47,920
get the impressions this is not someone

2601
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:50,350
to get by on their own some warriors

2602
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:52,510
building up a resistance hierarchy so I

2603
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:58,840
okay powder exactly know

2604
02:01:52,510 --> 02:02:03,310
he brings it over to his his array and

2605
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:06,640
pours it into a flask my god yeah

2606
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:12,610
begin begins to apply heat um and then

2607
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:19,810
as he does this you can hear what sounds

2608
02:02:12,609 --> 02:02:23,589
like the stairway collapsing oh okay

2609
02:02:19,810 --> 02:02:25,990
and you can you hear just like the ton

2610
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:29,850
of the wood splintering it's almost a

2611
02:02:25,989 --> 02:02:33,760
musical tone as some of the wood splits

2612
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:38,410
and then you can see but like around the

2613
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:42,340
edge where the staircase would be you

2614
02:02:38,409 --> 02:02:46,479
see two massive claws right on the lip

2615
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:48,699
of the edge and then it pulls itself the

2616
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:50,969
rest of the way up and it looks like it

2617
02:02:48,699 --> 02:02:56,590
looks like a professional wrestler

2618
02:02:50,970 --> 02:03:00,850
except it is a rat rattler a profession

2619
02:02:56,590 --> 02:03:03,610

then you reach out and then from it draw

2809
02:11:17,770 --> 02:11:23,630
the spectacular and it's almost like

2810
02:11:21,859 --> 02:11:27,710
it's in the same way like imagine like a

2811
02:11:23,630 --> 02:11:29,659
beautiful candelabra like I imagine like

2812
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:30,829
in like a dance scene from Beauty and

2813
02:11:29,659 --> 02:11:33,250
the Beast okay

2814
02:11:30,829 --> 02:11:37,899
imagine the polar opposite of that so

2815
02:11:33,250 --> 02:11:41,689
imagine that this razor sharp lattice

2816
02:11:37,899 --> 02:11:44,599
geometrical shape bursts up and out a

2817
02:11:41,689 --> 02:11:48,469
second in some way by the electrical

2818
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:50,720
charge of the rats and then as it goes

2819
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:53,329
up and begins to slightly spin and sway

2820
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:55,449
in the mid air pieces of it just start

2821
02:11:53,329 --> 02:11:57,109
to fling themselves toward targets oh

2822
02:11:55,449 --> 02:11:59,420
