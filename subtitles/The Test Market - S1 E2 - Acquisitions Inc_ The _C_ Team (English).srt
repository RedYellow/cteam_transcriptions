1
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:45,599
JERRY: Hello.

2
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,179
I am Tycho Brahe of Penny Arcade and PAX.

3
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,259
I am also Ominifis Hereward Dran,

4
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,939
CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated.

5
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,159
But today I am Jerry Holkins and I am running a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons for my friends.

6
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,099
Who I will introduce now!

7
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,539
Over here to my right,

8
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,879
Amy Falcone as Walnut Dankgrass.

9
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,780
JERRY: I've got Ryan Hartman, as Donaar Blit'zen-- RYAN: (clapping)

10
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,760
JERRY: That's... okay.... good!

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
RYAN: No one? JERRY: Exactly...

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,219
KRIS: (soft clapping) &gt;&gt; RYAN: Thank you. JERRY: I got Kate Welch.

13
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,639
JERRY: Not your grandma's grandma.

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,900
Rosie Beestinger. Monk of Shadows.

15
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,559
And Kris Straub as K'thriss Drow'b.

16
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:34,819
A warlock who doesn't 100% know what he's gotten himself into.

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
RYAN: Impish. JERRY: That's right.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,579
KRIS: Right. Delightful though. JERRY: Indeed, indeed.

19
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,739
JERRY: Hey so, before we get underway, we have our classic interactions from the channel as far as

20
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:52,179
advantage and disadvantage. Don't forget to put those to work. They have offered them to you.

21
00:01:52,180 --> 00:02:00,000
You may need them to survive. But there are some boons and banes up there also. That's new stuff.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
I just wanted to make sure that people know what's up.

23
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,560
Reflux will refresh your breath weapon, Donaar.

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,379
RYAN: Oh, nice. KRIS: Mmm!

25
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:15,319
JERRY: Walnut has got Forest Friends. Now maybe it's not as direct damage oriented as a spray of acid.

26
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,560
AMY: It's fine.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,640
KRIS: A spray of small animals. JERRY: From your thick sacks.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,939
JERRY: But... small friendly animals can help you get dressed and, you know.

29
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:27,259
KATE: (gasp) &gt;&gt; RYAN: Ooh. AMY: Disney Princess!

30
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,560
KATE: Oh my god! JERRY: Do some-- just rock it Disney-style, obviously.

31
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,960
JERRY: Back In My Day. So obviously Rosie, you have had many lives before this one.

32
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,319
This modern incarnation is but the most recent.

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:50,159
Back In My Day will let us grant your proficiency bonus to any of these old tasks under the assumption that

34
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,960
you've done a little bit of everything over the course of your life.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:03,260
The Neuveunomicon, K'thriss, will let you consult the book of shadows or your focus, and then you can use it

36
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:08,439
to gain the effect of Augury, which is a spell that will just say if something is-- It's Weal or Woe.

37
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,060
It's like, is this a good idea or a bad idea?

38
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,879
KRIS: Okay. That's valuable. JERRY: Right?

39
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,379
JERRY: It's like a magic eight ball... RYAN: I was about to say.

40
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:19,599
JERRY: but devious and mystical. RYAN: Ooh...

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,439
KRIS: Just like the magic eight ball itself. JERRY: Indeed, indeed.

42
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,659
JERRY: All right, hey, now.

43
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:30,500
We are about to get underway with the second episode of the "C" motherfucking Team.

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,060
KATE: (whispering) Yes...! RYAN: Titled?

45
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,780
JERRY: Are we ready to go? Yeah. This, episode two, entitled "The Test Market."

46
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,300
RYAN: Nice. I like starting with the title. AMY: Don't act like you got it!

47
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,040
JERRY: Oh yeah. No, no, I think starting with the title--

48
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,099
RYAN: So wait, we should-- what's the...

49
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,599
JERRY: Shut up! RYAN: What's this infer?

50
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,359
KRIS: Let him do it! KATE: Write it down!

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
RYAN: Write it down...

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,819
JERRY: No, it's an acrostic! Can you solve it in time? No, no, no...

53
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,919
KATE:  You can scramble it to say Lord Voldemort!

54
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,319
RYAN: The test blarket? What's a blarket? JERRY: No, this is some Dan Brown shit.

55
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,599
RYAN: Can I...? JERRY: No, it's like this. Donaar, shut it.

56
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,500
JERRY: So when last we left our heroes...

57
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,659
RYAN: (self high five)

58
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:13,859
JERRY: When last we left our heroes you had mounted four hale, hearty mice.

59
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,759
And you were on your way running towards the guttering point of the Homeward Star directed by

60
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,659
Rosie's lifelong fascination with the stars.

61
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,552
You have yet to see the creature that the mice have called Onyx,

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:39,660
but you know that such a creature caused all the fur along the ridge of their spine to ripple with terror.

63
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,620
That's the main thing that you know about this beast, whatever form it might take.

64
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,700
AMY: Weird. KATE: What could it be?

65
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,719
JERRY: Yeah, it's totally nuts.

66
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,279
KATE: I'm riding my mouse and I'm telling it in a very conversational tone stories about mice

67
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,419
that I've met in my long years, and asking if the mice maybe knows any of those mice.

68
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,800
AMY: Because they're all... JERRY: All mice know each other?

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
KATE: You know what... maybe, it's possible... KRIS: Wow! &gt;&gt; RYAN/JERRY: Whoa.

70
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,500
KATE: She can talk to mice! AMY: She's older. I get it. It's an older way of thinking.

71
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,519
RYAN: I apologize for my grandma. KRIS: It's not so cool anymore.

72
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,579
AMY: I apologize for my halfling friend.

73
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,419
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KATE: She's too innocent.

74
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,160
JERRY: It's been a problem in the past and we're all a little embarrassed. But it's fine, she'll forget all of it soon.

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:37,680
So, here's the situation. After probably 2 hours ride, the light has begun to dim out in the windows.

76
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,259
You think that day and night don't function correctly.

77
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:47,219
This was true the first time you experienced it in the first iteration in the Dran &amp; Courtier.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,319
These don't seem to be the traditional day and night cycles at all.

79
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,399
It's some simulation of it.

80
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,000
It's some interpretation of day and night at some whim.

81
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,360
You're not exactly sure how it's measured out.

82
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,160
But as it begins to get dark, the spell has worn off.

83
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,440
You can no longer communicate directly with these mice, but it is definitely time to

84
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,860
make a more traditional camp and get at the long rest.

85
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:25,579
In this case, before, when we do a short rest-- what that means is that a lot of your individual powers recharge.

86
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,600
You have the ability to spend hit dice and regain hit points.

87
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,819
The long rest can grant you some of those hit dice back.

88
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,519
But it also recharges all of your shit and gives you hit points.

89
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,379
AMY: Okay. KRIS: And the longest rest...

90
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,740
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: We get it K'thriss!

91
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,480
KRIS: Dismissal... From the table.

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,319
JERRY: And then obviously the longest journey, you're accompanied by friendly animals.

93
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,800
That's a different situation.

94
00:06:50,519 --> 00:07:01,319
But in order to provide for this rough and ready crew, I'm going to need some more survival from the pro over here.

95
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,459
AMY: Sure, the pro is me for those playing at home. JERRY: You are the professional--

96
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,680
JERRY: in this context, yes. AMY: I'm the professional survivalist.

97
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,639
AMY: Okay. So just a little survival check?

98
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,039
JERRY: Yep, yep. Just a little survival check.

99
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,040
AMY: All right lets see what we got. Big money! JERRY: Give it to me at the full juice.

100
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
KRIS: Getting hungry. KATE: Get that juice!

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,580
AMY: Argh... ten.

102
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,560
JERRY: Ah, that is not quite enough uh-- KRIS: To survive. &gt;&gt; RYAN: To survive, you die.

103
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:30,300
JERRY: to feed all of them. You can feed four people or animals with that check.

104
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,720
KATE: Uh oh.

105
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,599
AMY: Well...

106
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,879
JERRY: They gave you advantage dice

107
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,300
JERRY: and you did not use them so... AMY: And I did not use anything!

108
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,680
JERRY: that's not on me. RYAN: Summon Forest Friends, eat them.

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,139
(laughter) AMY: Well as a druid I do believe in the circle of life.

110
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,495
JERRY: Exactly! &gt;&gt; KATE: It's true. RYAN: Yeah right? You know? Sunrise, sunset?

111
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,120
KRIS: Summon them in my mouth. AMY: I say... I look to the team and I go...

112
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,459
AMY: Once again realizing that we have never properly introduced ourselves to each other,

113
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,680
AMY: so at this point I say--

114
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,439
JERRY: Hey I'm a druid and..

115
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,040
AMY: I go, hi I'm your druid. I was in charge of getting your meal for you today here's the thing--

116
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,460
AMY: No. Walnut just says, she goes-- JERRY: It's one of these restaurants.

117
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,560
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: I go...

118
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:20,259
AMY: Due to the sparse surroundings that we're in I was only able to procure enough for our mice friends,

119
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,500
who I think it's only fair to give them the food because they carried us the whole way.

120
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,120
Then I look at Donaar like maybe he has something to say about this.

121
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,860
RYAN: That's fine. No, I'm okay with this. AMY: Okay.

122
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,639
KRIS: It's all right, I'm full up on disappointment. RYAN: Yeah. Yeah.

123
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,620
KRIS: Stuffed. RYAN: I'll just eat my anger.

124
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,799
AMY: I'm worried that they won't be able to carry us... I also have a hemp rope you could eat. 50 feet. so...

125
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,899
KATE: Yeah, I have a bag of sand. KRIS: Yeah, bring it on.

126
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,439
RYAN: I don't have to brush my teeth if I don't eat dinner so that's a good thing.

127
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,940
AMY: So, even though I can't communicate with the mice I obviously bring whatever rations

128
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,480
I was able to find over to them.

129
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,399
JERRY: Yeah, food has historically been a form of communication.

130
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,039
AMY: Mmm, they're big on that. JERRY: Yeah.

131
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,360
AMY: That's all I can do. JERRY: So you feed them up.

132
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
JERRY: I would love to see constitution...

133
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,060
JERRY: ability checks from all my people. KRIS: From everybody.

134
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,359
KRIS: All right. KATE: Oh boy.

135
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,879
JERRY: That's a one, Rosie.

136
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,019
KATE: But! I do have lucky, I can re-roll a natural one on any ability check.

137
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,759
JERRY: That's good for you. KATE: Thank goodness.

138
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,819
RYAN: Oh Jesus. KATE: Starting it off strong.

139
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,940
KRIS: Can I burn this advantage over here?

140
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,640
KATE: 11... plus one. So 12. KRIS: Let me throw on that. So I have my garbage roll...

141
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,500
RYAN: Oh I get plus two, all right. KRIS: And I have an equally... no I'm okay on that one.

142
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,320
KRIS: Okay, so I got a 14.

143
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,000
JERRY: All right, that's okay. So you've got...? KATE: 12.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,019
JERRY: 12.

145
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,139
KRIS: Ah I found some jerky, it was right here! Had it the whole time.

146
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,199
AMY: What have you got? RYAN: Eight.

147
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,580
JERRY: Eight... AMY: Seven!

148
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,740
JERRY: Se... All right. The two of you are distracted...

149
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,019
by hunger.

150
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:56,740
It isn't a serious-- 100% serious thing but you do have disadvantage on rolls.

151
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,360
AMY: Oh, just that... &gt;&gt; RYAN: All rolls. JERRY: Only serious if you want to succeed.

152
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,259
AMY: Oh. RYAN: Yeah. (laughs)

153
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:05,100
KATE: It's a shame because I do eat human meat, but...

154
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,879
JERRY: Yeah.

155
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,220
KATE: but we don't have any humans. KRIS: No.

156
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,279
KRIS: Not available. AMY: True. Right, I just forgot.

157
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,000
AMY: Me Walnut, that I'm not a human.

158
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,879
If we're gonna conti-- I don't know what your plan is but at some point, I want to say now,

159
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,559
I would like to establish the watch schedule.

160
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,000
JERRY: Absolutely, tell me more. KATE: Learned that lesson.

161
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,539
JERRY: Let's hear about it. AMY: Oh, I will take first watch.

162
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,459
AMY: As atonement for not being able to provide for all of you, my traveling companions.

163
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,980
AMY: Strange though you may be. JERRY: Okay, I like it, who's got second?

164
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,920
KATE: I'll take second.

165
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,539
KRIS: You'll take second? How long do you need to sleep as a halfling?

166
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,799
KATE: Not long. JERRY: Yeah, how long do your people sleep?

167
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,839
KRIS: Right. (british accent) I'm curious, I hope it's not rude... but...

168
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,740
(laughter)

169
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,100
I only need four hours. Like I figure that's four, four, we get through the night on eight.

170
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,899
KRIS: I mean, provided that that's a real night. AMY: We could just stay up all night and party!

171
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,000
KATE: Yeah. I'm usually in bed by seven... AMY: Elf time!

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,860
KATE: but I'm up at like four. KRIS: Right.

173
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,500
KRIS: For that early bird special. RYAN: Yeah, the blue plate. &gt;&gt; KATE: Right. Yeah.

174
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,519
AMY: This guy needs his beauty rest, I assume.

175
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,620
RYAN: Yes! Eight hours. Start to finish.

176
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,059
KRIS: And then another four right after. RYAN: Plus I've gotta... yeah.

177
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,220
RYAN: Another 15 start, I need a wind down period too.

178
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,720
RYAN: What does that count as? KRIS: I've got to read for a while...

179
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,639
KATE: It takes me a while to fall asleep. JERRY: It's like your amount of rest equals 27 hours.

180
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,860
RYAN: Well, because I'm gonna get-- JERRY: Per one day cycle.

181
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,600
RYAN: I can't go to bed fussy. I need to cool down. KRIS: Right, settle down.

182
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,700
RYAN: I need the me time.

183
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,860
JERRY: You got the... you have a cold bath, then a hot bath, then a cold bath.

184
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,080
Absolutely. So we'll slot you in...

185
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,660
KRIS: Second, I don't care. JERRY: Third slot.

186
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,799
KRIS: I feel like that gets us in there.

187
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:31,039
JERRY: Absolutely. KRIS: How long we sleeping?

188
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,940
KRIS: It's a long ass night.

189
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,380
RYAN: I'm like, man, you-- KATE: Rosie's already asleep.

190
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:37,480
JERRY: I need these. I need these treasures. KATE: She's out.

191
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,399
AMY: You need your trouble dice. JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,240
KATE: Oh I don't like trouble. JERRY: Well no, no.

193
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,460
JERRY: You will like it.

194
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,240
You will like it because it will create a dramatic scenario you'll be able to tell your friends about the next day.

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,120
AMY: It's true. Nobody makes a movie about the weekend nothing happens.

196
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,580
JERRY: No. KRIS: Weekend at Bernie's.

197
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,500
AMY: You're right.

198
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,419
KRIS: Yeah. That guy was dead the whole time. RYAN: Yeah!

199
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:57,259
JERRY: That's the exception that proves the rule! KATE: Stupid me.

200
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,980
RYAN: But... he wasn't.

201
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,280
JERRY: Shut up! KRIS: I didn't watch the ending!

202
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,299
RYAN: Oh ho...! AMY: Oh my god! &gt;&gt; KATE: God...

203
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,399
JERRY: There's a stat-- KRIS: He was rotting!

204
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,759
(laughter)

205
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,960
JERRY: There's a statute of limitations on this shit.

206
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:18,759
Walnut and Rosie... you do what you do. Nothing particularly odd occurs during your watches.

207
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,600
AMY: Oh! RYAN: Wow.

208
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,000
JERRY: Is this-- What's...?

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,580
AMY: This is a special handshake that we've already come up with.

210
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,980
JERRY: No. It didn't work guys. KATE: We worked it out in the cab.

211
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,960
KRIS: Clasp!

212
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,639
JERRY: I'm going to apply negative-- for that type of... KATE: No!

213
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,039
JERRY: It's like somehow you manged to leave each other hanging.

214
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:37,059
JERRY: I don't know. This-- it's never happened before! RYAN: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Incompatible.

215
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,019
KRIS: Protocols all wrong.

216
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,159
JERRY: Well listen-- Don't hadoken!

217
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,879
That's even worse! That's a blast of psychic energy.

218
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:50,299
All right. K'thriss. I would love to see what a perception roll means to you.

219
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:53,539
KRIS: I'm going to give you that, and I'm going to burn one more of my advantages.

220
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:59,199
Also I did take two, including this one, so I should have three, not four.

221
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,800
Or not five! Come on guys!

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,879
AMY: Can someone please nerf this warlock? Oh I'm sorry. He's on our side?

223
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,340
KRIS: I got to-- No, it's good. AMY: Never mind.

224
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,080
KRIS: So let's see. That's trash. You don't want that one at all. You want this one instead. It's way better.

225
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,720
KRIS: It is way better. JERRY: Is it?

226
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,779
KRIS: It is... 21.

227
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,339
RYAN/KATE: Ooh. JERRY: Jeez.

228
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,340
JERRY: So you hear-- KRIS: No, it's 20.

229
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,720
JERRY: Yeah-- it's-- well-- it's--

230
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,100
RYAN: Oh never mind. AMY: Don't bother.

231
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,580
RYAN: Game over. Kill the stream. Sorry everyone. Bye.

232
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,159
JERRY: Eat it. Swallow it. Eat that dice!

233
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,679
No, no. Don't do that. That's actually a metal dice. God only knows what that would happen.

234
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,980
JERRY: So everyone else... is... RYAN: (whispering) Hey you got four.

235
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,080
JERRY: is in various states of repose.

236
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:46,919
There's a little trickle of acid leaking out of the corner of Donaar's mouth.

237
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,159
RYAN: All right. JERRY: Directly onto the wood.

238
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,759
JERRY: But the amount of damage, very small.

239
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,679
JERRY: You know what I mean? KRIS: Negligible.

240
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,719
JERRY: It's not like an Aliens situation where it's like multiple decks. It's fine.

241
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,319
But you hear a rhythmic bass rumble...

242
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:11,980
that carries through the wood of the great floor that you are resting on.

243
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,440
KRIS: Bass rumble. RYAN: Mmm.

244
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,799
KRIS: Is then-- I can't determine a direction. It just seems like beneath?

245
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,939
JERRY: It feels omnipresent.

246
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,300
RYAN: There's a party in the bowels of the ship. Like Titanic.

247
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,579
KRIS: Yeah I'm trying to remember whether or not this bar had a basement.

248
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,759
And maybe that's the case. Maybe they're just cleaning up. Getting ready for the day.

249
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,120
RYAN: Trying to remember the CAD drawings? (laughs) The architectural layout?

250
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,560
JERRY: Yeah. For the heist movie.

251
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,899
KRIS: This is second watch?

252
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:45,399
JERRY: This is third watch. KRIS: The third watch. Okay.

253
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:53,579
KRIS: Who's the least likely to be a Cranky Gus if I rouse them?

254
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,340
KATE: Me. JERRY: Probably be a grandma.

255
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,560
KRIS: Okay. KATE: Mm-hmm.

256
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,959
KRIS: (whispering) Hey! I wake you up.

257
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,899
KATE: (whispering) What?

258
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,740
KRIS: (whispering) Do you hear that? In the ground.

259
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,480
KATE: Do I hear it?

260
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,360
JERRY: You feel it. KATE: Okay. I can feel it?

261
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,940
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: I can feel it.

262
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,740
KRIS: (whispering) What do you think it is?

263
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,219
KATE: That's a great question. Thank you for asking.

264
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:18,120
KRIS: (whispering) I'm sorry. I mean I woke you up to determine the answer to that.

265
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:25,920
KATE: Well I think we got a miniature situation happening here, so my guess it's either footsteps

266
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,599
or perhaps someone walking around upstairs.

267
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,839
We should maybe wake the others.

268
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,819
KRIS: Where have we made camp? Is it on a central location on the floor?

269
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,280
JERRY: Your guess...

270
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,840
just trying to map--  the scale of the environment,

271
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,840
trying to map it, you think that you are underneath a three-legged stool.

272
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:59,200
So it's got the long trunks that come down at these sort of extreme angles over here.

273
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:03,659
And then a round canopy at the top.

274
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,740
KRIS: Okay. Yeah we got to wake everybody up. KATE: Yeah let's wake everybody up.

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,340
KATE: I don't trust this. Yeah. KRIS: It's concerning.

276
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,639
KATE: Wake up! KRIS: Get up, gang.

277
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,699
RYAN: Huzzabuh!

278
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:18,319
AMY: Being woken up on third watch, does anybody take any penalties to stuff that they're getting back?

279
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,199
Don't bring that up to the DM. Who's talking?

280
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,879
(laughter) KRIS: What?

281
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,659
AMY: Sorry! JERRY: You fucked up.

282
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,980
KRIS: It was a ham radio. Interference. JERRY: You fucked up.

283
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,279
KRIS: Did you hear that voice? AMY: Just joking, folks!

284
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,520
JERRY: You guys were already relatively well rested so I'm not going to adjudicate it too much.

285
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:45,199
But as you are roused from camp, you can see that the mice are wild-eyed.

286
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,620
RYAN: Ask them-- KATE: Could this be Onyx?

287
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,379
AMY: This could be-- RYAN: Ask them what up?

288
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:56,279
AMY: I am saving the ability to talk to something for when we meet Onyx.

289
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,039
RYAN: (sigh)

290
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,759
KRIS: Hmm. Wise. JERRY: So your first thought, Rosie Beestinger,

291
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:12,500
is how long-- dead run-- how long would it take to get from where you are now to where the guttering candle

292
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,740
of the Homeward Start points to this door.

293
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,960
KATE: With no mice to help us?

294
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,799
JERRY: (stammers) That would be-- With no mice to help you-- you don't even want to consider that yet.

295
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,879
KATE: Okay, okay. RYAN: Yeah.

296
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,500
KATE: All right. JERRY: You don't want to consider that.

297
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,960
KATE: Okay. JERRY: We're talking about perhaps an hour.

298
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,420
KRIS: They're going to run anyway. We may as well be on their backs.

299
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,240
KATE: That's true. &gt;&gt; KRIS: That's not even a thing. RYAN: How big is this room?

300
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,460
RYAN: How small are these mice?

301
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,860
JERRY: Are they going to run the right way? KATE: Sure.

302
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,179
JERRY: You know what I mean? AMY: Mmm!

303
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:48,879
JERRY: Are they going to run the right way? So you see against the opposite wall, against the door,

304
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:56,500
you see a black shadow. Almost like an elephant's truck, drop down and dip...

305
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,519
KATE: Ugh. AMY: Great.

306
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:03,099
JERRY: on the other side of this canopy.

307
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,180
Swoop down and curl up languorously.

308
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,180
Like an upside-down question mark. Curls up around the edge.

309
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,140
KRIS: (whispering) That's a cat's ass-trunk!

310
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,180
RYAN: Ooh... AMY: (coughing) Sorry, had to cough once.

311
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,060
AMY: (coughing) I've been holding it in!

312
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,119
JERRY: No, no, it's fine. I understand that we're all dying of some disease.

313
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,919
AMY: I'm ready!

314
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,900
JERRY: Some random disease! AMY: It's all the dust being really close to the floor.

315
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,840
JERRY: Yeah, oh exactly! AMY: (coughing) This is in character.

316
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,159
KRIS: Bring it into your performance, yeah.

317
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,980
JERRY: Obviously there are mites! RYAN: Use it!

318
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:33,819
KRIS: Yeah step on my choker. Dumb cough. KATE: Giant mites! We've been riding them around.

319
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,379
JERRY: It's all material. It's all material.

320
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,440
KATE: If I had to pick an animal to talk to, it would probably be the ass-trunk of that cat.

321
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,340
AMY: Sure. RYAN: Talk to the tail.

322
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:43,379
KATE: Talk to it. Talk to its butt.

323
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,740
AMY: I would like to-- KRIS: It must possess a rudimentary intelligence.

324
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,480
KRIS: It's part of the spine!

325
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,740
JERRY: All right. KRIS: Surely there's...

326
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,420
RYAN: (laughs)

327
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,700
AMY: Whew... wow! KRIS: No more.

328
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,500
AMY: I would like to try and parlay with this cat who I believe to be my friend Onyx from before.

329
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:07,160
JERRY: Well here, so how are you going to get at this? Because it may do something as you're trying to do this.

330
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,720
Are you going to approach this as a ritual casting of the spell? Which wouldn't require a slot.

331
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,360
Are you going to cast the spell directly?

332
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,379
JERRY: Things may move too quickly for you to-- AMY: To be able to stop?

333
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,360
RYAN: How much bigger than us is this thing? JERRY: to get at that.

334
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,039
AMY: Oh big. KRIS: Yeah, what's the scale?

335
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,920
JERRY: We'll have an opportunity-- There's a reason why cats fear mice.

336
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,319
Part of it's the scale.

337
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,980
RYAN: Cats fear mice? Or mice fears cats?

338
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,720
JERRY: Listen. It's topsy-turvy. The opposite. RYAN: Oh all right.

339
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,480
JERRY: Don't worry about it. KATE: It's Dungeons &amp; Dragons, dude!

340
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,360
RYAN: I know! I keep being told that. KATE: Cats fear mice in this world.

341
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,059
(laughter) JERRY: It's Cats &amp; Mice! It's Cats &amp; Mice.

342
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:51,680
The mice begin to paw and scratch agitatedly at the wood. And you see them lower their shoulders...

343
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,580
AMY: Okay. JERRY: like ready to...

344
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,759
JERRY: Ready to try to make a break for it. Ready to try to keep their part of this bargain you struck...

345
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,000
AMY: Okay. JERRY: to get to the door.

346
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,339
JERRY: So they are--these mice are ready to collaborate with the party in trying to get the fuck out of here.

347
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,640
AMY: Okay. I mean then maybe we should just go and if the cat intercepts us then deal with him?

348
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,720
Like let's just-- the mice are going to go without us.

349
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,600
KATE: Can you cast the spell on the go?

350
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,019
KATE: From the back of a running mouse? RYAN: Aren't we supposed to be killing--

351
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,539
RYAN: this cat for the mice? AMY: Yeah I would just have to deal with concentration.

352
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,920
KATE: No, I don't think Walnut's going to let us kill a cat. AMY: We're not killing the cat.

353
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,320
RYAN: What? &gt;&gt; KRIS: I'm undecided. KATE: I don't think Walnut will let us kill a cat.

354
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,159
RYAN: Circle of life! The cat's going to kill the mice otherwise.

355
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,819
You're going to broker peace between cats and mice?

356
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:32,399
AMY: I can't go back on my word.

357
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,240
JERRY: Would you like to talk about this...

358
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,799
AMY: On the mice. &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah! JERRY: On the mice. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Mouseback.

359
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,000
RYAN: Once we run away we like-- AMY: I really can't break my oath.

360
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,500
JERRY: Do you want to do a-- RYAN: I think we should kill the cat, everyone!

361
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,220
JERRY: It's like an Aaron Sorkin-type thing. KRIS: Yeah.

362
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,920
JERRY: Where you're just jalking down the corridor. RYAN: Yeah.

363
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,980
KRIS: Breakneck speed.

364
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,380
JERRY: Yeah exactly. But you each get a cool pithy line in there.

365
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:02,000
So yeah you have got a handful of the fur around this thing's neck.

366
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,180
And once everyone is on, it's like the shot of a gun. It's like the beginning of a race.

367
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
AMY: They're off. JERRY: And they are off.

368
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,779
JERRY: Bouncing back and forth over these troughs between the boards and the floor.

369
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:26,339
You pass underneath a second stool.

370
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:27,159
AMY: Okay.

371
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,640
JERRY: Cut to the right underneath a chair. This is something they know how to do.

372
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,160
There's a lot of zig-zagging underneath these-- basically wherever they can find canopy,

373
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,019
they are trying to emphasize that.

374
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,120
They reach one of the larger canopies, what you assume is one of the tables nearest the door.

375
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:55,539
And as you are riding forward, you see what looks like a waterfall. You hear a heavy-- like a loud clank.

376
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:56,240
AMY: Oh no.

377
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,500
JERRY: And you see what looks like waterfall sheet-- like an amber waterfall-- fall straight over the edge.

378
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:11,559
And we need to keep these mice out of the way. They are completely panicked with fear.

379
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:16,359
But everyone else can tell me how they're trying to manage their mouse situation...

380
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,900
in the face of this new threat.

381
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,360
KRIS: Oh man!

382
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,779
KATE: Whew! KRIS: That cat's trying to piss right on us.

383
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,299
KRIS: That amber sheet-- (laughter)

384
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:29,039
KATE: Is that cat peeing on us? JERRY: That amber sheet. It's thick.

385
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,359
AMY: I don't think it's cat piss. JERRY: It's gelatinized urine!

386
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,199
KRIS: Rips of cat urine!

387
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,440
KRIS: Flooding the entire-- RYAN: Ropes of cat urine?

388
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,240
JERRY: No, no, no. It's-- KRIS: It's entwined!

389
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,720
JERRY: It's thick like a whip!

390
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,019
Like it cracks and-- No, nothing that's--

391
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:43,379
JERRY: None of that's real. RYAN: Just a pungent, real acrid--

392
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,480
KRIS: Oh yeah. RYAN: Fills the nostrils!

393
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,700
KRIS: I hate it, but... I kind of like it.

394
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,559
JERRY: I respect it! I respect this cat's urethra.

395
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,480
No! It hits the ground and begins to coil-- No it's nothing like that.

396
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,680
JERRY: It's like a spring-- None of these things are true. KRIS: It's like honey.

397
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,140
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: Uh...

398
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:01,319
JERRY: Anyway, so K'thriss. Let's start with you. KRIS: Are we currently-- we're in formation--

399
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:11,839
JERRY: Yeah Exactly. Imagine that there is a greyhound racetrack except it's all small people on mice.

400
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,699
Imagine that configuration.

401
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:23,160
Just sort of a loose phalanx rushing toward this surprising, heavy curtain of foamy, amber liquid.

402
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,380
KRIS: I-- (laughs)

403
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,980
KATE: I'm going to gently encourage my mouse.

404
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:32,440
I've been talking to my mouse the entire time because I don't care what any of these people think about me.

405
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,740
And I'm going to tug on my mouse's fur ever so gently--

406
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,620
JERRY: Fur? Ears? KATE: making conversation. Yeah, yeah.

407
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:42,239
KATE: Just like-- oh there's some liquid coming. Let's dodge around that real quick.

408
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,500
Can I encourage my mouse to steer around it?

409
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,619
KRIS: It wasn't literally the pee-pee though, right? KATE: No, it's not!

410
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:50,219
AMY: You made that up!

411
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,819
KRIS: It just kept coming and I thought-- KATE: It's beer!

412
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:58,299
JERRY: No, no, no. So yeah, yeah. In this case we're talking about a wisdom proficiency--

413
00:23:58,299 --> 00:23:59,899
we're talking about a wisdom ability check here.

414
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,180
KATE: Okay. I'm pretty wise. Maybe. JERRY: So let's see it.

415
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,100
KATE: 18. JERRY: Any animal handling there?

416
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,119
KATE: 18. No animal handling. JERRY: Okay.

417
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:09,899
JERRY: So you are able to--

418
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,600
despite what you have seen elsewhere--

419
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:21,460
the communion, the rapport you developed with this rodent is profound and lasting.

420
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,620
JERRY: You're going to be writing letters after this. KATE: Absolutely.

421
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:25,799
JERRY: It's incredible. KATE: We go way back already.

422
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,500
JERRY: Oh yeah--

423
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,000
KATE: We already identified three mice that we both know.

424
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,779
JERRY: And two mice that you both hate!

425
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,059
KATE: Yeah. Hate them. Can't stand them.

426
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:38,679
JERRY: Exactly. So this curtain-- this sheet is coming around, it's just a quick zig-zag.

427
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:45,720
It isn't even like the momentum goes forward and around, it's just like a quick left hop, quick right hop,

428
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,140
and then right past the sheet.

429
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,740
JERRY: K'thriss. KRIS: Incredible.

430
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,559
KATE: It's easy!

431
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,319
KRIS: This whole time-- What kind of check is this?

432
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:59,319
JERRY: This is going to be wisdom. We have the animal handling. But remember-- I want to emphasize this:

433
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,919
This is Dungeons &amp; motherfucking Dragons.

434
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,660
KRIS: Oh I know, yeah. JERRY: Look at this sheet,

435
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,160
KRIS: Well this is why-- JERRY: Think about your spell list...

436
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,900
RYAN: Do something fun. Entertain me. KRIS: Make them like it. &gt;&gt; KATE: Make them laugh.

437
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,720
JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: Well here's the thing--

438
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,860
AMY: Where's the magic, Magic Man? KRIS: and I don't know if it'll inform the roll,

439
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,299
KRIS: but since I know we're getting ready for this cat assault.

440
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:22,019
And I know your game; you want to speak with it.

441
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:31,240
I've had my hand on my sigil, my glyph, this whole time ready to pop Dissonant Whispers. Just in case.

442
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,519
And I don't know if that's going to give me the grip I need on this mouse pelt.

443
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,039
KATE: That's true. KRIS: So let's find out.

444
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,059
KRIS: Guess what. I'm not even going to take the advantage.

445
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:42,279
AMY: Why would you not take the advantage on the important--

446
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,559
JERRY: One hand on the neck. RYAN/KRIS: Yeah.

447
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,139
AMY: Fine. KRIS: Let's find out. Just all the way around.

448
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,720
JERRY: That's a d12! KRIS: That's not it! That was a huge number.

449
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,039
AMY: Sabotaged yourself. KRIS: Physically large.

450
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,099
JERRY: You want to keep it?

451
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,259
KRIS: Yeah, I'm going to need better than that.

452
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:59,019
KRIS: I have no animal handling-- RYAN: (laughing) You took advantage.

453
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:02,879
KRIS: And that is a wisdom... (tongue clicks) that's a eight.

454
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,020
JERRY: Oh my god-- KRIS: Yeah.

455
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:05,639
JERRY: So this-- RYAN: He fucked off.

456
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:14,140
JERRY: This-- You're riding forward. You're moving over here. You're whispering something to your focus.

457
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,279
Nothing happen. This sheet hits you like a prizefighter.

458
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:25,119
This heavy liquid just-- it's like... riding through...

459
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,000
KRIS: Like a lake? JERRY: Like a curtain of iron!

460
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
JERRY: It's just like (punches palm)

461
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,740
It's like-- Imagine an evil version of a carwash.

462
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,380
A dangerous version.

463
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,100
KRIS: But of beer.

464
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,259
JERRY: Yeah. Exactly.

465
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:41,400
KATE: Oh no. A dark car wash.

466
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,240
JERRY: Yeah. Take two points of damage.

467
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,259
RYAN: Beer damage.

468
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,540
KRIS: You are inebriated until next round. JERRY: No you are.

469
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,819
KRIS: Uh... okay. JERRY: You are inebriated.

470
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,039
KRIS: All right I did that.

471
00:26:54,359 --> 00:27:01,660
JERRY: You are inebriated and you come off of the mouse and the mouse rolls over here and you're both

472
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,480
on the ground, basically on your backs.

473
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,579
KRIS: Like a motorcycle accident.

474
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:09,240
JERRY: Yeah exactly. It's like there's two shots.

475
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,539
There's like, before beer curtain. And after beer curtain.

476
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:17,279
And post-beer curtain, there is no longer a rider and the mount.

477
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,839
KRIS: No. It's two flailing creatures. JERRY: It is just a pile of flesh.

478
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,899
JERRY: Exactly right. Donaar Blit'zen.

479
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,340
How do you contend with this threat?

480
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:26,740
KRIS: Do better than that.

481
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,440
RYAN: I'm a big, strong, tough man-- boy.

482
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:36,159
So I'm going to use my strength, and I'm just going to grab him by the haunches up here and be like, turn!

483
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,140
And then turn back. And then turn his little head like a steering wheel.

484
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,160
KATE: Are you riding backwards?

485
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,680
RYAN: Yeah. Aren't you? KATE: (laughing) Okay.

486
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,059
RYAN: I never ridden a mouse before.

487
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:46,179
RYAN: I never seen any of this stuff. AMY: The French-style.

488
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,120
RYAN: I'm a dragonborn, side-saddle--

489
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,079
JERRY: Yeah I want that dragonborn side-saddle on the mouse!

490
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,039
RYAN: I'm like...

491
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,920
KRIS: The tail doesn't work, you gotta-- RYAN: Yeah.

492
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,940
KRIS: You got to sit there-- KATE: All right so you grab its haunches.

493
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,779
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. (laughter)

494
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,799
KATE: (laughing) That's what you said. JERRY: You lean back.

495
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,740
RYAN: I used the wrong word, Kate, apparently.

496
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:07,480
I don't know what a haunch is. I'm a dragon man. I just saw a mouse before. I live in a secluded city...

497
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:10,159
You people all look like walking, upright pigs to me!

498
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,900
AMY: It's a very clean city. No mice.

499
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,180
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Mouse-free!

500
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:17,860
He doesn't even know what these are. So yeah I am totally okay with--

501
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:20,740
RYAN: Just overpowering it with strength. Just turning it where I want to go?

502
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,279
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: You roll too high you strangle it.

503
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,099
JERRY: I was going to say, yeah--

504
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,480
(laughter)

505
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,940
KRIS: You just go snap! AMY: You snap its neck!

506
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,180
(laughter)

507
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,940
RYAN: (laughing) And then I just slide to like a halt.

508
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,600
KRIS: He's not running. He's not running.

509
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:35,199
JERRY: No it's just like a chunk of mouse licorice-- RYAN: My mouse broke.

510
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,360
JERRY: like just twisted into a coil.

511
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,779
RYAN: All right well let's cross this-- JERRY: Yeah I like it.

512
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:40,799
AMY: Let's see. RYAN: All right.

513
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,399
RYAN: I'm going to use advantage. I'm not going to fall into-- I saw what happened to my buddy over here.

514
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,580
KRIS: Yeah okay. I was trying to play by the rules.

515
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,159
JERRY: I love it. AMY: Thanks folks at home.

516
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,940
AMY: Maybe?

517
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,620
RYAN: Ten...

518
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,039
JERRY: Remember. Advantage. AMY: You get to do it again.

519
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,839
RYAN: Oh yeah advantage. Also I'm doing this strength--

520
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,319
RYAN: so I'm getting a bonus here... RYAN: Yeah plus three right? Yeah.

521
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,879
RYAN: Okay so that would have been 13. AMY: Yeah but get better.

522
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,200
JERRY: So 13 yeah. RYAN: Better than 13...

523
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,039
KRIS: You should do better.

524
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,279
RYAN: Well nope! 13's better than that!

525
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,119
AMY: That was a one.

526
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,740
KATE: That was a one.

527
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:05,679
RYAN: Or do I get an athletics bonus?

528
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
RYAN: Or is this all just strength? JERRY: No I think athletics is okay.

529
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,519
RYAN: Then 15!

530
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,319
KATE: All right. JERRY: 15's all right.

531
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,220
AMY: He gets to add whatever he wants. JERRY: So basically this is just about conditioning...

532
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,480
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: You trained for this!

533
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,099
JERRY: You trained for this mouse-riding--

534
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:19,559
RYAN: I'm pommel-horsing this mouse. Hup! Hup! Hup!

535
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,339
(laughter)

536
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,159
KATE: Still backwards. RYAN: And I'm looking at you on the ground like...

537
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,299
JERRY: I like that.

538
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,419
KRIS: Whoa! I flip my glasses up.

539
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,420
RYAN: I flip mine down. JERRY: No, there's more glasses.

540
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,840
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: So...

541
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:35,199
JERRY: You're able to adjust around the edge--

542
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,180
This isn't the hop hop.

543
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:40,839
This is more like steering aircraft carrier type thing.

544
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,220
You catch the edge of the beer curtain but are not--

545
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,180
RYAN: Take a little sip to be a cool guy.

546
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,160
RYAN: It's like (slurp) and I keep going. JERRY: Delicious.

547
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,880
RYAN: I wink. (tongue click) JERRY: No, so you make it through.

548
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,500
JERRY: So through, through, heap of flesh. RYAN: Dead.

549
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,580
JERRY: And what do you got?

550
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:56,379
AMY: Let me ask you this. JERRY: Yeah.

551
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,199
AMY: Do I-- I only get one action right? I can't do two things here?

552
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,980
JERRY: This is one action, right now. Action packed!

553
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,640
AMY: Blat. Soon as I had a good one.

554
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,259
JERRY: What do you got? Describe your fantasy scenario.

555
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,779
AMY: My fantasy scenario is to-- JERRY: That involves these mice.

556
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:17,660
AMY: fortify my mouse, and also rescue K'thriss at the same time.

557
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,600
KRIS: Whoa. RYAN: Wow.

558
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,000
JERRY: I'll let you do something about K'thriss once you're through.

559
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,759
AMY: Okay. JERRY: Because he is tumbled out past.

560
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,039
AMY: Let's see if I get through. KRIS: Are we separate--

561
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,599
KRIS: Did I bust through it and then collapse? Because I'm through the curtain, but I'm on my ass.

562
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,599
JERRY: Yes! And so is your poor mouse. KRIS: Okay.

563
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,240
RYAN: So we're under the bar, I take it? Roughly.

564
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,759
KATE: I think I'll go after K'thriss if you go after the mouse.

565
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,759
AMY: I think...

566
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,119
RYAN: You got to get through this curtain first. AMY: Just wait--

567
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,759
AMY: Just wait 'til you see what Walnut's cooking in the kitchen.

568
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,819
KATE: All right. AMY: Maybe nothing. We'll find out!

569
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:52,240
AMY: So I see this before me. And I see everything that's happening to... my companions?

570
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:54,439
AMY: Meh I don't know if we're going to use that word yet.

571
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
KRIS: The mice you care about and the people who have enslaved them.

572
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,160
AMY: People that I have-- Yeah exactly. The mice I care about. The people that I have to share equity with.

573
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,259
RYAN: We defend the mice. AMY: I look down on my mouse.

574
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:12,220
AMY: It doesn't seem like there's much time to turn, so I am touching this mouse and I cast Barkskin.

575
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:15,660
To fortify my mouse so we can barrel right through it.

576
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,240
RYAN: The mouse's armor class is 18.

577
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,519
(laughter)

578
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,200
JERRY: Interesting. Well here, no I like this.

579
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,319
AMY: I think I can do it.

580
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,920
JERRY: I like this.

581
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:28,460
Yeah. So give me your check and I will adjudicate.

582
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,600
AMY: Okay! We'll see.

583
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
AMY: What check? JERRY: You got the animal handlings.

584
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,180
JERRY: You got the wisdom.

585
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,360
AMY: I have wisdom. JERRY: Let's see it.

586
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,919
AMY: My build actually called not for animal handling. Weird for a druid!

587
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,400
RYAN: Yeah weird for someone with Forest Friends. JERRY: Yeah because you're the animal. Right?

588
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,100
AMY: It's because I'm the animal. Thanks, internet.

589
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:44,719
JERRY: Yeah.

590
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:45,960
AMY: I hate it.

591
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,480
Why didn't I use advant-- Hmm...

592
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,339
AMY: Oh hey! RYAN: Ooh you got lucky there.

593
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,099
AMY: It's plus wisdom, plus-- 21.

594
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:52,859
JERRY: But everyone's hungry so you have disadvantage.

595
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,840
KATE: (gasp)

596
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,319
(grumbling)

597
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,919
AMY: But this one's going to be even better!

598
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,200
Big money.

599
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Oh my god! It's a 19! It was! And she said it and it was.

600
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,240
JERRY: It was. And it became so. AMY: 22.

601
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,440
AMY: Or 21. RYAN: 21. You got to use your worse one, right?

602
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,559
AMY: Well whatever! RYAN: Yeah.

603
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,200
AMY: They're both really good. KRIS: So you fall off the mouse.

604
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,380
KRIS: The mouse dies. AMY: The mouse is dead.

605
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,880
JERRY: Exactly. So you...

606
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,600
RYAN: (whispering) Can we eat your mouse? KRIS: (whispering) Yeah.

607
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,759
JERRY: There's no mouse eating.

608
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,440
Wait. Not yet. Obviously that's going to happen.

609
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,319
It's inevitable.

610
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,019
(laughter)

611
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:24,839
KRIS: It's our prize.

612
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:30,779
JERRY: So... you got a firm grip. Arms around the neck of the mouse-- Gently!

613
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,020
AMY: Gently.

614
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:33,779
JERRY: Yeah it's not a thing.

615
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,219
You...

616
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:42,640
Through your hands you communicate the Barkskin spell and the bark forms over it. Almost like barding.

617
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,800
Lke a horse's barding. Like in plates that fold...

618
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,599
JERRY: from the front to the back. KRIS: You conjure the hull of a ship.

619
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,139
AMY: Wow. RYAN: Nice.

620
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,620
JERRY: And then you just whisper--

621
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:59,099
What do you whisper into the mouse's ear as you are about to connect with this sheet, or get around it?

622
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,540
KRIS: I got one for you but you're not going to want it. AMY: (whispering) Oh my god--

623
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:04,399
RYAN: I love you. (laughs) AMY: What do you got?

624
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,759
KRIS: (whispering) Full squeaks ahead!

625
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,559
AMY: (laughs)

626
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,720
No! Because I care about this mouse and I would never say that.

627
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,079
JERRY: Full squeaks ahead. AMY: No, I don't know.

628
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,119
KRIS: That's their word-- Sorry. AMY: I whisper some secret prom-- (laughs)

629
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:15,879
JERRY: Satan.

630
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,380
AMY: I whisper some secret promise to keep it safe and allow no harm to come to it.

631
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,680
KATE: Nice. AMY: Something cute.

632
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,580
RYAN: Oh this is going to end poorly. I'm excited. KRIS: That's what mine came as.

633
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:25,179
RYAN: You should name it too because this is only going to end well later.

634
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,940
RYAN: Get it as attacked as possible. KATE: We're not going to eat your mouse.

635
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,420
AMY: No, I say, I told you I would not break my promise.

636
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,739
JERRY: Nice. AMY: And I go-- (kissing sounds)

637
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,960
JERRY: Yeah yeah. I love it.

638
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,840
KRIS: I love you, boat mouse! (engine sound) RYAN: (kissing sounds)

639
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,259
(laughter)

640
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,940
AMY: (laughing) That really got me!

641
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,779
JERRY: All right. AMY: (laughing) That was good.

642
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:43,740
JERRY: Wuh wuh.

643
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,059
AMY: (chefs kiss sound)

644
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,259
JERRY: So you are riding straight through.

645
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:53,200
And as you get right to the edge of it, you sort of swing yourself off to the side...

646
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,980
AMY: (gasps)

647
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,740
JERRY: And the beer curtain connects with the top,

648
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,740
and then you go right underneath the mouse,

649
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,200
and then swing yourself up on the other side.

650
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,319
And then you see your two companions still riding away,

651
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,799
but you can see K'thriss, who smells like a brewery...

652
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,080
JERRY: And his soaking ass mouse-- KRIS: Clean now.

653
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,980
RYAN: You finally got that bath.

654
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,519
JERRY: Maybe ten feet to the right.

655
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:22,639
You can see the two of them getting up and trying to make sense of this situation.

656
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,739
AMY: Great. At which point, I go-- (laughs)

657
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,019
Sorry about this buddy! And I cast Thorn Whip, which...

658
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,119
Don't worry!

659
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,199
(laughter) KRIS: I'm not. I'm just astounded.

660
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,780
AMY: Don't worry. This is my cantrip. RYAN: In a drunken stupor.

661
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,040
AMY: Haven't pulled this one out yet. I create a long, vine-like whip, I mean covered in thorns...

662
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,779
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Listen!

663
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,360
AMY: Lashes out at your command towards a creature in range. Right. Blah blah blah blah blah.

664
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,940
Anyway, the creature takes (mumbling) piercing damage.

665
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,400
KRIS: (snorts in laughter) AMY: And then the creature--

666
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,780
AMY: is pulled up to ten feet closer to you, which would be on my mouse with me.

667
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,920
AMY: So I'm about to... getcha. KATE: Lasso your ass.

668
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,159
AMY: Get you with my thorns.

669
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,639
KATE: Young seed. AMY: Let's see.

670
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,879
JERRY: This is mystical. KRIS: This is incredible!

671
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,380
JERRY: Yeah, yeah! This is awesome.

672
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,800
AMY: This is the only thing I did not do-- This is the only thing doesn't make sense for my build.

673
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,980
JERRY: For your build? AMY: I thought it was badass.

674
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,300
JERRY: Ah... I see. &gt;&gt; KATE: Nice. AMY: So I took it! (laughs)

675
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,480
KRIS: It is! &gt;&gt; JERRY: It's the utility. RYAN: It's super cool.

676
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,719
JERRY: Well it's like Jim's spell list.

677
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,579
KRIS: But can it land, is the question. AMY: It's like Jim's whole spell list.

678
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,059
JERRY: He's 9th level... RYAN: Yeah all she does is just slashes your face.

679
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:25,840
JERRY: Yeah he's 9th level and it's all tools. KRIS: Well... I'm glad that it worked.

680
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,780
AMY: Well, we'll see! KRIS: So I'm on the back of the-- (laughs)

681
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,920
AMY: I don't know. JERRY: So how does it work?

682
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,639
AMY: I have to make a melee spell attack against the target.

683
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,279
JERRY: Now remember, you have disadvantage.

684
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,620
So if you want one dice, you should probably use the advantage from the channel.

685
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:39,039
AMY: I would love to use the advantage from the channel.

686
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,940
RYAN: I would love it if this just whips you in the eye, and miss like--

687
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,960
AMY: Why would you love that?

688
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,300
RYAN: It's fun. AMY: We're on the same team.

689
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,600
RYAN: Because it makes me laugh. AMY: I think last week I called them Walnut's Nuts, so...

690
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:51,440
AMY: Thanks, Walnut's Nuts. I would like to use my thing.

691
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,639
JERRY: Yeah. Use your thing.

692
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,960
AMY: Okay, I don't know how to do a melee spell attack.

693
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,760
Maybe the people at home also don't know. And also maybe Donaar wants to learn how to do it.

694
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,780
RYAN: Oh yeah. Teach me. I'm new.

695
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,019
AMY: We're all learning here. RYAN: I'm new.

696
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:04,139
AMY: It's only the second episode.

697
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:05,159
JERRY: Oh here we go. Let me see your sheet.

698
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,160
KRIS: Well don't metagame this.

699
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,559
RYAN: Apparently this...

700
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,079
AMY: I have a spell sheet... RYAN: The way to play is just to hand paper around?

701
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,579
AMY: Spell attack bonus is plus five?

702
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:13,840
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. AMY: That sounds good.

703
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,460
KATE: You want to hand me another one? KRIS: You have to say, I'd like to approach the bench.

704
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,420
JERRY: It's the same as the other bonus so you're good. RYAN: I have Bane.

705
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,079
KATE: Ooh let me see that.

706
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,639
AMY: Well that was a two.

707
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,079
JERRY: K. AMY: But I get to go again, right?

708
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,219
JERRY: No, no, no. This advantage just-- All this--

709
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,119
AMY: All it did was just made it that I had a--

710
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,159
JERRY: Daddy's working.

711
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,519
KRIS: Yeah no cross-talk. Christ.

712
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,619
JERRY: Daddy's working. KRIS: Shut up.

713
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:36,179
AMY: Okay so I rolled a five. So that is truly the number I got. Plus five is a ten.

714
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,000
JERRY: What's your AC?

715
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:39,819
KRIS: Uh it's a toilet.

716
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,740
KATE: It's 13.

717
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:43,799
KRIS: I'm just drowning in an unflushed toilet. It's 13.

718
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,760
AMY: (whispering) Son of a--

719
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:52,760
JERRY: So as you're riding by, this arcing whip of thorns, reaches out, shreds part of his cloak...

720
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,060
KRIS: (groans)

721
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:56,139
And that spins me as it goes.

722
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:57,319
JERRY: Like a top.

723
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,360
KRIS: Yeah. (sounds of trailing off)

724
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,460
JERRY: He pirouettes in place briefly, and then is back on the ground.

725
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,880
AMY: Well um...

726
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,559
RYAN: And we all see this and I say, what are you doing? Why are you hitting him?

727
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,759
KRIS: And I go, what a heck of a brew.

728
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,940
(laughter)

729
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,639
That's some powerful stuff.

730
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:17,299
KATE: I'm going to sigh heavily and cast Minor Illusion.

731
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,080
JERRY: Yeah.

732
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,400
KATE: Somewhere far away from us, I'm going to make the sound and image of a mouse lose its shit.

733
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,180
KATE: To hopefully... JERRY: Just flipping out?

734
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:28,739
KATE: to buy us some time to rescue K'thriss and K'thrissmas.

735
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,460
AMY: Aw cute. JERRY: You're going to save K'thrissmas?

736
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,740
KATE: Yes. Yeah.

737
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,319
RYAN: How's his mouse?

738
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,820
RYAN: Like is it still on the ground? Is it doing anything? KRIS: I don't know. We're going to find out

739
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,000
AMY: It's inside out. JERRY: We'll get to it. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Okay.

740
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,139
KRIS: The beer pulverized it. That's what happens. All right.

741
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,220
KATE: So hopefully Onyx has been distracted by my Minor Illusion.

742
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,119
JERRY: Yeah let's take a look here.

743
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,359
KRIS: I haven't heard of a cat's presence yet. I mean I assume-- it knocked something over, but...

744
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,079
KATE: The mice are going crazy so I feel like... JERRY: Oh! &gt;&gt; KRIS: Yeah.

745
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,199
JERRY: Okay. That's... KATE: Onyx fell in love with my mouse?

746
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,759
KATE: Is that what that says? JERRY: They... is going to get married.

747
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,219
KATE: That's amazing. Again! AMY: Don't like marriage.

748
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:04,439
KRIS: It's fully satisfying.

749
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,860
JERRY: It's like that's what you can come to the "C" Team for. Every episode a marriage.

750
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,239
AMY: We're all about love here.

751
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,259
JERRY: Sometimes it's about a bipedal dragon and a liquid door.

752
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,720
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: Right?

753
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,719
RYAN: Sometimes regret. I should have married that door.

754
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,719
JERRY: This time... KRIS: Yeah. You let it get away.

755
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,720
JERRY: This time--

756
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:24,239
RYAN: It comes back it's yours. (laughs)

757
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:30,779
JERRY: So you create this mouse, and basically just on another vector that is running way over.

758
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,440
And it's just squeaking, scrabbling...

759
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,599
JERRY: Like it's delicious.

760
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,420
JERRY: Like this mouse was engineered-- KRIS: (kissing sound) Choice.

761
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,539
JERRY: for maximum flavor and freshness. KRIS: (chef's kiss sound)

762
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:40,940
KATE: (laughs) AMY: Mmm... Ugh.

763
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,320
JERRY: And then you-- KRIS: Rancher's Reserve.

764
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,620
JERRY: And then this is--

765
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,920
I would say, legitimately... terrifying.

766
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:53,579
You see this giant, black shape.

767
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:58,420
I mean like a-- Imagine a person trying to hang a cloak on a hook.

768
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,139
And then just a cape just falls to the ground.

769
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,319
That's how much sound this thing makes.

770
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,160
KATE: Huh.

771
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:12,980
JERRY: When it comes off of the canopy and lands on what is not a mouse. Like there is no sound.

772
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,480
There is just a shape and light, but there is no sound of any kind.

773
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,460
KATE: Ah.

774
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,880
JERRY: All right. So you have problems. You have serious, serious problems.

775
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,460
RYAN: You still going to try to parlay with this thing?

776
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,119
AMY: Anytime now.

777
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:30,759
JERRY: So we still have our K'thriss.

778
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,300
KRIS: I'm just going to take it easy. JERRY: Your mouse is shaking off its fur.

779
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:43,100
JERRY: It's sort of a beer aerosol mist around it.

780
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:48,699
And then it just looks over at you like, what? What are we doing? What's next?

781
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,939
AMY: Get on the mouse, drow!

782
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,119
KRIS: Yeah I haul myself to my feet, if it's possible.

783
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,380
JERRY: Yeah it's possible. KRIS: Must a check be performed?

784
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,940
KRIS: Is there an inebriation state? I believe you.

785
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,800
JERRY: There is an inebriation state.

786
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,900
KRIS: I trust you. RYAN: Nice.

787
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,940
KRIS: So I take it cutaneously?

788
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,380
RYAN: You went through and you were like, what is that? (gargling sounds)

789
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,700
AMY: (laughs) KRIS: Wah! (gargling sounds)

790
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,519
JERRY: No, no, no.

791
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,980
KRIS: (sounds of drinking and inebriation)

792
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:20,500
JERRY: I have checks. It's just that thus far you haven't had any negative outcomes from it.

793
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,719
KRIS: Oh okay.

794
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,039
JERRY: The mouse had its own problems there for a turn.

795
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:28,939
He seems like... He's looking at you like, wow!

796
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,640
JERRY: That was all incredibly real. KATE: That was some good beer.

797
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:37,799
KRIS: No we're fine. But not for that much longer. So I run over to him to remount him.

798
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,780
JERRY: "Re-mouse?" KRIS: Yeah.

799
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,660
KRIS: Mouse up. JERRY: Grab up on. Yeah exactly.

800
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,599
JERRY: Tug, tug. And now you have begun to run further toward the door.

801
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,659
The black shape-- So you look back over your shoulder.

802
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:58,299
You see the black shape, same level of sound, just jump up into the air and disappear.

803
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,740
KATE: Okay.

804
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,839
KRIS: Whoa. JERRY: I know. I know.

805
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,980
KRIS: Then I ground again.

806
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,360
KATE: Okay. I need to do another thing.

807
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,119
JERRY: More Dungeons &amp; Dragons? KRIS: Hope it's friendly.

808
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,699
KATE: Yeah well, Donaar, would you like to do anything or can I scoop you?

809
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,579
RYAN: No, it's fine.

810
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,059
KATE: Okay. Well then I shall cast... RYAN: I'm just going to mess around with the door.

811
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,800
KATE: Pass without Trace-- JERRY: We're just steady mousing.

812
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,680
KATE: upon myself and a in radius around me. So stick close, folks.

813
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,639
RYAN: Yep. KATE: We're going to Silent Town.

814
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,920
KRIS: Yeah so the question becomes as you do that... RYAN: Yeah how far apart are we?

815
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,200
KRIS: do I become the only thing outside of that radius? (laughter)

816
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,519
KRIS: And now you zeroed in. AMY: I hope so.

817
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,880
KATE: It's possible. I've done my best.

818
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,319
KRIS: Well okay. Does the magic scale? So there's a range there.

819
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,019
KATE: Is this real feet? KRIS: Yeah. An equivalence?

820
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:53,839
KRIS: Everything, including the cat, is now invisible?

821
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,079
JERRY: So here is what happens next.

822
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:01,079
AMY: Oh no. JERRY: He is behind you trying to catch up.

823
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:12,840
JERRY: As you are running, she whispers a few words, and you feel and see the shadows around you gather

824
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:21,220
and cling in a gauzy way to the mice and yourselves as you are running through this area.

825
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:25,239
It is at this time that you see...

826
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:29,639
a rain of objects...

827
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,059
KRIS: (whispering) No...

828
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,280
JERRY: from the other side of this canopy...

829
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,840
AMY: The cat. Where you inch it closer to the--

830
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,680
JERRY: No. This is exactly it.

831
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:45,639
I want everyone to appreciate how dangerous and scary a cat would be just doing its normal cat shit.

832
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:49,339
KRIS: I like the idea like all these objects tumbling, make haste!

833
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,019
And then cut to the cat going...

834
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,699
(laughter)

835
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:54,439
JERRY: Meow. Meow. KRIS: Just this BS.

836
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,980
KRIS: Cat nonsense. JERRY: No, no, no.

837
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,980
JERRY: You see this rain of objects. It's hard to tell what they are just yet.

838
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:10,659
But they just cascade off of the edge of this and they are hitting the wood. Some are sticking into the wood.

839
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:13,559
Some bounce briefly and roll.

840
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:18,779
But the closer you get to it, it's clearly a chess set.

841
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,219
So this is basically almost a forest-scale chess...

842
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:28,939
AMY: We are so tiny. KRIS: Bad cat.

843
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,480
RYAN: Yeah wow. These are the smallest mice.

844
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,240
AMY: If we're going to talk to the cat I'm going to be like--

845
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,419
AMY: (squeaks greeting) KATE: Let's challenge the cat to a chess game.

846
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:40,039
RYAN: I like it. They weren't playing chess before. Weren't they playing some weird game?

847
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,139
KATE: No they were playing some weird game.

848
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:44,779
JERRY: She didn't throw the board down, so it would be hard to...

849
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,280
KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; KATE: Oh. JERRY: Know what I mean?

850
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,340
JERRY: So those things are kicking. And then the board's staying there and all the things are flying off.

851
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,740
We've all seen it.

852
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,280
(laughter)

853
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:56,099
KRIS: Classic cat move. RYAN: Yeah.

854
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:03,360
JERRY: But navigating this-- I mean, again this is more like a forest. This not like a dressage thing.

855
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:12,260
Like this is-- You are entering a context that requires a different approach.

856
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,660
At least for the duration of the pieces.

857
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:16,619
AMY: Okay.

858
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:19,819
KATE: And the cat still cannot see or hear us.

859
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,940
JERRY: Right now. That's right. KATE: Currently.

860
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,619
AMY: So who's at the front of the pack?

861
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:29,659
JERRY: I think that you are at the front of the pack. AMY: Great answer.

862
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,699
AMY: So can I make some check to slow my mouse's roll a little bit?

863
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:38,679
JERRY: Mouse slow? Absolutely you can slow the mouse roll. Sure.

864
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:41,599
AMY: How would I do that? Can I do a survival thing? KRIS: It's a racial trait.

865
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,420
JERRY: We're still talking about that wisdom stuff.

866
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:50,619
But remember, disadvantage. You're welcome to use a dice to make the boo-boo go away.

867
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:52,079
AMY: Is this what I want to do?

868
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
JERRY: I think so. AMY: I'd really like to avoid conflict with the cat.

869
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,840
JERRY: No, no. Listen. This is Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

870
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,240
RYAN: It's inevitable. JERRY: I can pick up whatever you put down.

871
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,239
JERRY: I'm just saying one dice is better than two bad dice.

872
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,919
AMY: Then we all escape. And we did a great job. And also I did something cool to make it happen.

873
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,940
JERRY: Yeah and I'm the winner.

874
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,260
RYAN: Wow. Theater of the mind.

875
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,520
AMY: I'd like to use one of my-- JERRY: Yeah. I won Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

876
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:14,719
AMY: Oh all right. Well.

877
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:16,800
AMY: Bye. KRIS: New Game Plus.

878
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,840
KRIS: Keep going. AMY: I'd like to use one of my special nuts.

879
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,179
AMY: One of my special dice so I get one good roll here.

880
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:25,579
JERRY: Exactly. That wis. Throw the bonus in.

881
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,519
KATE: I think you're taking my dice away.

882
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,900
AMY: Okay and then the bonus... JERRY: Now add the bonus.

883
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,119
AMY: is... three, so 15.

884
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:34,980
JERRY: Perfect.

885
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:40,000
KATE: Jerry. I think you're deducting my dice instead of Walnut's. I just saw my number go down.

886
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,599
JERRY: Boop. KATE: Thanks.

887
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,940
AMY: No, I think it's fine. KATE: No, I think I'm going to address this really quick.

888
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,900
KRIS: That's good. You're a team player. People appreciate that.

889
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,519
KATE: I would happily donate one of my dice to Amy.

890
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:50,699
RYAN: Yeah but that's not in the rules.

891
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:52,500
AMY: Well now I got nothing! JERRY: Yeah exactly. You ate them all up.

892
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,239
RYAN: (hisses) Stickler. Believe me I want to. AMY: It's because I was getting peer-pressured!

893
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:57,339
JERRY: You're the worst. Long story short, you're the worst.

894
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:08,019
So you are able to tuck back, pat, calm this thing down, along its barky plates.

895
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:08,960
AMY: Oh right.

896
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,940
JERRY: And the closer you get to the set you can see that it's actually a dragonborn chess set.

897
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,740
AMY: (shudders)

898
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:22,959
JERRY: Like some part of your mind registers that this shape is all dragonborn warriors, clerics...

899
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,320
You know what I mean?

900
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,980
JERRY: Like that's the theme, right? RYAN: Handsome.

901
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,820
KRIS: It's a great set.

902
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:30,799
AMY: Great. RYAN: Yeah.

903
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,140
RYAN: That's a good set. That's a strong, powerful set.

904
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:34,759
KRIS: I have one at home. RYAN: Admirable.

905
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,800
RYAN: Something to aspire towards.

906
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,660
JERRY: Quality set. KRIS: I stop to admire.

907
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,699
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Nope! I don't stop!

908
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:42,039
KATE: I stop to admire as well.

909
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:42,719
AMY: Ugh.

910
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:43,799
JERRY: So you pull...

911
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,400
AMY: I slow the mouse. KATE: This one looks like you!

912
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,139
RYAN: (laughs) I hug it. JERRY: Exactly.

913
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,440
AMY: You cross-talkers.

914
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,159
I'm trying to rescue you.

915
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:51,779
JERRY: You got a good situation going here.

916
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,640
AMY: Yes.

917
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,179
JERRY: Behind a rook you can see that there are a couple dragonborn on top of it.

918
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:01,440
Sort of looking out over the nonexistent battlefield.

919
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
AMY: Yes.

920
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:06,019
JERRY: Yep. Rosie.

921
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:11,539
KATE: I'm admiring a chess piece until Walnut tells us what the plan is.

922
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:15,259
RYAN: So we're all running towards these because they're all scattered on the floor.

923
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,220
JERRY: They're all scattered on the floor.

924
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:19,779
RYAN: Roughly how many? Do we have an idea? Are we able to tell? Are in front of us.

925
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,160
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean like I say, some hit, some bounce, some rolled away.

926
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:30,860
In your field of vision right here you can probably see 30, 35 pieces of varying sizes.

927
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:40,820
Imagine a forest scenario. There's tall pieces, there's waist-high cover, ala Gears of War.

928
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,260
RYAN: Gotcha. Some are on its side. Yeah. KATE: Are we able to do--

929
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,800
KATE: like an Endor forest speeder bike thing with our mice? And just--

930
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,620
KRIS: (Star Wars speeder bike sound)

931
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,759
KATE: Like that. RYAN: What are they made of?

932
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,639
JERRY: You can try-- They're heavy. Like a pewter-type. RYAN: All right.

933
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,139
RYAN: I'm new to this game, so I don't know how, like say acid, works.

934
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:01,219
Could I theoretically blast a blast of acid and just clear a line?

935
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:04,139
RYAN: Could I just go over my mouse and bleh. KATE: This is how this game works.

936
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:05,879
RYAN: But I don't know the rules of acid.

937
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,800
KATE: Ask him what the rules of acid are. RYAN: Are those the rules of acid? Can I do that?

938
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,340
RYAN: Can I shoot an acid blast ahead of us to clear a path?

939
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:20,000
JERRY: Yeah my position, generally speaking, with stuff like that, is that as long as it is sufficiently rad...

940
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,039
RYAN: Okay. It'd be pretty badass.

941
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:23,619
KATE: Acid barf is so rad.

942
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:25,039
JERRY: It's kind of balling.

943
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:33,860
But you can see your companion, Walnut Dankgrass, is clearly trying to establish a different tone.

944
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,960
It's up to you. Like I say, you can't get in trouble with me.

945
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,380
RYAN: Fill me in on your plan then.

946
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:43,500
AMY: Oh I look back and obviously we're trying to be quiet.

947
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,940
And I go like this.

948
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,940
And then I go this.

949
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,120
And then I go...

950
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:52,279
JERRY: There's some special-- (laughs) AMY: And then I go...

951
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,000
KATE: Right. AMY: And then I go...

952
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:55,699
AMY: And then I go...

953
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,239
KRIS: And I'm like, what the hell is any of that?

954
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,019
Curve ball.

955
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:03,539
KRIS: All right. Got it. KATE: I get it. She wants us to admire this chess piece.

956
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,820
RYAN: Oh yeah. It is a nice chess piece.

957
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,159
KRIS: Order today.

958
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:08,500
(laughter)

959
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,179
AMY: Well all right I'll try to whisper. I don't know what the rules of Pass without Trace are.

960
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:14,579
KATE: I think you can just talk.

961
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:15,920
AMY: Can you talk in there? KATE: Yeah.

962
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,740
AMY: Well I wouldn't know that. KATE: Let me read it to you.

963
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:21,039
JERRY: Yeah this is good information. AMY: Sure good information but I wouldn't know that.

964
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:26,639
KATE: A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection.

965
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:29,599
For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you, including you,

966
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,500
has a plus ten bonus to dex (stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means.

967
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,199
A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

968
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,439
AMY: I take it back. That's actually also one of my spells so Walnut would know about this.

969
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,179
She looks back and goes, I was saying...

970
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,100
We're going to go this way.

971
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:48,360
I'm going to take the lead.

972
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,380
We're going to go.

973
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,400
Then all you,

974
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,220
follow me.

975
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,140
AMY: Obviously. KATE: Acid barf?

976
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:54,460
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Sure.

977
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,980
RYAN: Can I-- &gt;&gt; KATE: (laughs) AMY: What? You got something?

978
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,780
RYAN: Now I don't want to do it.

979
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,540
(laughter)

980
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,300
KRIS: Is there like a time dilation? Has this been 20 minutes of this?

981
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,700
JERRY: No, here this is all very, very quick. This is happening very fast.

982
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:14,180
You guys are-- you are catching up to the rest of the group.

983
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,059
KRIS: Right.

984
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:17,239
JERRY: But you did not have the benefit...

985
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:18,039
Kris: (whispering) Oh no.

986
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,480
JERRY: of this mystical shroud.

987
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,260
So you are seeing the same thing they see, but you have a very different connotation. Right?

988
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:30,799
And as you approach this forest of game pieces.

989
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:33,299
That same...

990
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,980
It's like a manta ray. Imagine swimming beneath a manta ray.

991
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:42,900
You see that black shape fall opposite the chess pieces.

992
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:50,079
And you see it just reach out, just completely casually, reach out and grab a piece and just fling it.

993
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,500
But it's like a catapult!

994
00:50:52,059 --> 00:51:00,119
I mean it's like what's happening with this paw is, at your scale, beyond terrifying.

995
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:03,099
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: These are heavy pewter pieces.

996
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:05,099
JERRY: I mean you seen a set like this.

997
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,139
JERRY: It's just gone. KRIS: We've all played with them.

998
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:09,779
JERRY: Just... through the air.

999
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,040
KATE: At what point-- how close does he have to get before Pass without Trace affects him as well?

1000
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,079
JERRY: You mean for him? KATE: Yeah.

1001
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:20,559
JERRY: He can move into the thing but I think that Pass without Trace...

1002
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,239
KATE: It's 30... KRIS: We need some equivalence.

1003
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,099
KATE: This says range so 30 yards I think. KRIS: Figure out what the range is.

1004
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:25,039
JERRY: Exactly.

1005
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,099
Yep. So as he enters.

1006
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:31,779
I was trying to figure out if it would happen, if he had to be there at the beginning. But no, it's a veil.

1007
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,840
KRIS: Okay.

1008
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,800
JERRY: So as you approach the edge of it and get within, you can feel...

1009
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,880
And obviously for you it's like a spa.

1010
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,000
KRIS: It's like I'm in the Halls of Medicine.

1011
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,139
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Exactly. KRIS: It's like a relief.

1012
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:46,099
JERRY: (laughing) It's like a...

1013
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,619
mentholated shadow.

1014
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,880
KRIS: The darkness. It soothes. JERRY: Exactly.

1015
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,579
JERRY: It enters the sinus and you feel better immediately.

1016
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,880
KRIS: Ah immediate relief. For only 12 hours.

1017
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,340
JERRY: Yeah exactly. At least!

1018
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:08,360
So you move in and as soon as you-- because you can hear the scrabble of the mouse. It's slight but it's there.

1019
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,240
And then it just disappears the closer you get in.

1020
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:15,879
KRIS: I see, I see. Okay. I am still going to pop...

1021
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,000
Dissonant-- no I'm not going to do that.

1022
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,340
(laughter)

1023
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,539
AMY: I can't stop you. JERRY: Hold on I pop... Cat Murderer.

1024
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,860
KRIS: I was going to say Detonate Feline.

1025
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,019
Animal. Which works in a-- all right.

1026
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:32,940
It's a detonation check. I don't know if that's on there.

1027
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,460
JERRY: Oh! He fails!

1028
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,740
KRIS: There's no multiplier.

1029
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:37,879
JERRY: His head goes one way.

1030
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,340
KRIS: I'm going to do Dancing Lights behind me.

1031
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,200
KATE: Ooh what's that? KRIS: Just to uh...

1032
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:44,099
KATE: What's Dancing Lights? AMY: Oh. It's a laser pointer.

1033
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:47,239
KRIS: It's just a flashy show. It's just a little racial trait I have.

1034
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:49,399
JERRY: Is it like Laser Zeppelin?

1035
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:56,219
KRIS: Yes. It's fancy. Yeah it's the logo in that, you know, constantly withdrawing shape.

1036
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:57,759
JERRY: So right behind you?

1037
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,619
KRIS: (sigh) Well I'm assuming the cat is back there.

1038
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:05,559
KRIS: Right? We've come through-- JERRY: No the cat has dropped in front of this forest.

1039
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:08,440
KRIS: Okay so... forest in front of us.

1040
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,400
KRIS: We have not yet-- JERRY: You are right at the edge.

1041
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,820
JERRY: Ready to move right through this thing. And it's over here clearing a piece.

1042
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,120
AMY: Through the forest. KRIS: Right so the question is...

1043
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,799
RYAN: Yeah it's doing our work for us.

1044
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,320
KRIS: So the question becomes am I able to cast this such that it will distract the cat but not the mice?

1045
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:32,079
I don't want it to disturb the mice. I want to get the cat's attention elsewhere. Off of us.

1046
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:36,480
That's why I was thinking if it was behind us I would cast it immediately after so,

1047
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,059
because I know it's heading this direction. And then it's going to be distracted.

1048
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:41,139
KATE: What's your range?

1049
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:44,259
JERRY: Go ahead and cast it, but tell me where you're going to put it.

1050
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,720
KRIS: 120 feet. It's a long ass way. &gt;&gt; KATE: 120 feet. JERRY: By you or behind you.

1051
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:48,319
KRIS: I can do wherever I want. RYAN: Yeah.

1052
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,539
AMY: You can still put it behind us

1053
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:52,199
AMY: and the cat would see right through us. KRIS: I put it directly inside the cat's eyeballs.

1054
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:55,799
RYAN: 120 feet relative to you? Of your feet? KRIS: I'll put it on to the cat's retinas.

1055
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,340
AMY: Yeah that's less one inch. KATE: Okay but seriously. Maybe?

1056
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,940
AMY: Maybe do it. Put it behind us.

1057
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,639
KATE: Try put it-- I mean on the retinas of the cat.

1058
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:06,839
KRIS: I'm going to ask you a question, and it is a serious one. Do I have line of sight to the cat's retinas?

1059
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,519
AMY: (laughs) JERRY: Yeah you can see the... You can see its--

1060
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:11,599
KRIS: I am very small. JERRY: Yeah you can see its iris.

1061
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,940
KRIS: And it's flashing in the dark, I assume. AMY: K'thriss and the mouse with the laser pointer.

1062
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,460
JERRY: Yeah it's just emeralds.

1063
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,460
KRIS: All right. JERRY: Evil emeralds.

1064
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:22,039
KRIS: I am going to take my advantage on this one.

1065
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:23,099
KATE: This is very good.

1066
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:28,500
KRIS: You like lasers? I don't know if I need an advantage for that.

1067
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,800
JERRY: Is Dancing Lights a...

1068
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,099
KATE: I don't think you need to roll. JERRY: Yeah you don't need to roll.

1069
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:35,239
KRIS: Do I not? Is it? Oh no it's-- KATE: You just do it.

1070
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,819
KRIS: Yeah I don't need advantage. KATE: It's a great roll though.

1071
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,100
KRIS: No, it's a great roll.

1072
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:40,960
RYAN: Save that one for later. JERRY: Bank it.

1073
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,940
JERRY: Yeah. No, no. Here's the situation with Dancing Lights.

1074
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:49,359
Like this is something drow children do.

1075
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,620
Like this is not-- (laughing) You know what I mean? This is not crazy pants stuff.

1076
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:53,380
KATE: Yeah, dummy. RYAN: Yeah.

1077
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,099
JERRY: This is normal stuff.

1078
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:57,259
JERRY: You would do it to entertain yourself. KRIS: Kris doesn't know that.

1079
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,860
KRIS: K'thriss is well aware.

1080
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,840
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You do this to entertain yourself.

1081
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:04,139
So you-- so right in front of it?

1082
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,519
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: Okay.

1083
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:15,920
JERRY: You see the-- you make this cloud of fairies or you know, at this range it just looks like a mesh.

1084
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,260
KRIS: I think it's literally-- JERRY: Of mathematical lights.

1085
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:23,140
KRIS: Yeah I seem to remember that it is... either it's Dancing Lights or Faerie Fire...

1086
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:25,739
KRIS: No, it's Dancing Lights as a cantrip.

1087
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:30,659
But it's like four spheres?

1088
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:33,219
KRIS: Anyway I can center those right up-- JERRY: Yeah exactly.

1089
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:37,419
KRIS: onto those eyes. JERRY: So its eyes cross for a second,

1090
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,659
and it blinks a couple times and then just walks forward and moves through the Dancing Lights.

1091
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:45,179
KRIS: Into the other two.

1092
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:46,779
JERRY: Yeah exactly. (laughter)

1093
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,900
JERRY: Dun, dun, dun! KRIS: Good luck.

1094
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,720
RYAN: Just keep blasting it at him.

1095
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:57,259
JERRY: And then it gets low and is just raking its eyes across this mesh of pieces.

1096
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,820
And just in the back of its throat it says,

1097
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,539
(hoarsely) "Far Mice!"

1098
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,559
KRIS: That's what they all say. RYAN: Mm-hmm.

1099
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:07,259
KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: That's your buddy right there.

1100
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,059
KATE: Real nice guy. RYAN: Yeah.

1101
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,340
AMY: Hoh! (laughs)

1102
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,300
RYAN: He doesn't know we're here yet! Maybe we should wait 'til he sees us before we...

1103
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:24,239
AMY: That's the other thing. I'm really... I'm truly keeping this until the cat gets closer and gets a bead on us.

1104
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:26,099
KATE: Great, great. I think that's good.

1105
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:27,119
AMY: Maybe we should try and move through--

1106
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,699
KATE: So Onyx is now moving across the chess piece forest?

1107
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:35,279
JERRY: Just right now just sniffing-- like it's just using all of its profound senses.

1108
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,840
Senses designed to catch and eat things your size.

1109
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,260
And it is just playing it across.

1110
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,460
RYAN: He ain't magic though.

1111
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,460
KATE: I got Pass without Trace for an hour, so...

1112
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,679
AMY: We should go around...

1113
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,339
KATE: Unless it just starts to bite at random spots I don't think it's going to find us.

1114
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,120
AMY: That's a dog move.

1115
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,619
RYAN: Give Felix here a wide berth. You know what I mean?

1116
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:58,859
KRIS: Yeah. Cat... name.

1117
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:02,039
AMY: I think we should try and make our way through?

1118
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:05,000
JERRY: Yeah you approach this anyway you want.

1119
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,019
KATE: Yeah let's take as direct route as we can because these mice are not getting any happier.

1120
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:10,940
AMY: I agree. Let's go right through.

1121
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,940
KATE: Let's go through!

1122
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:13,739
RYAN: Between his legs? KATE: Yeah.

1123
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:15,719
RYAN: (laughs) All right. KATE: AT-AT style.

1124
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:17,579
AMY: Let's do this. Lots of Star Wars.

1125
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,299
KRIS: Ah you could have used Thorn Whip.

1126
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,880
JERRY: All right that's plus ten on dex checks?

1127
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,640
KATE: Yep.

1128
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,239
RYAN: Oh! I got bad dex.

1129
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:27,019
AMY: No, but we get the plus ten from-- KATE: We get the plus ten from me.

1130
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:28,219
KRIS: Everybody gets it. RYAN: Oh. Yeah.

1131
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:29,519
JERRY: Plus ten-- KATE: We all rolling dex?

1132
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:31,360
JERRY: Plus ten, but remember! Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1133
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,320
AMY: What? KRIS: (gasp)

1134
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:36,199
JERRY: You have disadvantage because you didn't get anybody food.

1135
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:38,339
JERRY: Now you can use your checks-- RYAN: Yeah. Well just us two.

1136
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,900
JERRY: You can use your checks if you want.

1137
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,660
KATE: You guys have disadvantage. I'm good. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,239
KRIS: I'm going to eat-- KATE: Beer counts as food.

1139
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:46,119
KATE: That's what Pat Rothfuss just text. KRIS: So full. It's like a Guinness.

1140
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:47,420
RYAN: I said, spit in my mouth! (laughs)

1141
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,920
JERRY: Did Pat Rothfuss…

1142
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,139
KATE: He texted me. He says beer does count as food.

1143
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:53,559
KRIS: Don't-- Why is he in here? AMY: It's liquid bread.

1144
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:55,199
KRIS: Why lie about it? It's a good idea.

1145
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,359
AMY: (laughing) It is a good idea.

1146
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,420
RYAN: Tell him to go find some beeswax and mind it.

1147
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,639
JERRY: Patrick Rothfuss!

1148
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:02,400
AMY: Please, I'm glad he's whispering in your ear.

1149
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,559
KATE: Rosie's fine with it. RYAN: No, no, it's great.

1150
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:05,219
AMY: She's bedfellows with Viari.

1151
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:07,500
JERRY: I'm going to get him. Let's go ahead and see it.

1152
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,960
KATE: Okay. Everybody gets a dex-- Oh boy. That's a-- I'm going to reroll that one because I got lucky.

1153
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,099
JERRY: Yeah. Your lucky trait is paying you big time. KATE: I'm a lucky bitch. Ooh. 14. Yikes.

1154
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:19,960
KATE: Oh but I get an extra five because of my dex bonus.

1155
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,039
KRIS: Everybody likes me. KATE: 19.

1156
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,300
JERRY: Okay.

1157
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,780
KRIS: All right. I'm going to take my advantage. One of these.

1158
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,260
KRIS: Because I don't want to miss again. KATE: Do it. You don't want to get this--

1159
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,900
KRIS: Those are hard pewter pieces. KATE: bullshit happening.

1160
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:35,460
KRIS: That's... well I mean, that's not great. Whatever. 14. Screw it. Don't want that.

1161
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:38,000
KATE: Ooh. KRIS: Even better than that. It's infinity.

1162
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,360
KRIS: So... Yeah. JERRY: Amazing.

1163
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,820
RYAN: You transcend space and time.

1164
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,660
JERRY: I like it. All right. KRIS: It's 25.

1165
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:45,339
RYAN: Uh...

1166
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,680
RYAN: Huh? AMY: So you roll a dice and then you get plus ten.

1167
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,739
RYAN: Plus ten, yeah.

1168
00:58:48,739 --> 00:58:50,879
AMY: And then nothing else because you don't have--

1169
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,340
RYAN: But we have to do it twice because we both have disadvantage.

1170
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,460
KATE: Yeah. AMY: Right.

1171
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,280
RYAN: And we got to take the bad one.

1172
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,160
JERRY: But you can buy your way out of it if you want to.

1173
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:57,539
KRIS: Yeah and then you only have one. AMY: Stop pressuring me.

1174
00:58:57,539 --> 00:59:00,900
RYAN: You've already essentially failed, right? AMY: I only have one.

1175
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,320
RYAN: Have you? Or...

1176
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,620
JERRY: No, no. She's okay. KATE: No. I'm fantastic.

1177
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:04,599
RYAN: All right then I'll use it then.

1178
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:05,960
AMY: Yeah you got three. Go for it.

1179
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,159
AMY: You have lots of friends.

1180
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:08,460
RYAN: I'mma use it. JERRY: Hit it.

1181
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:11,619
AMY: (gasp) RYAN: That's a 27.

1182
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:12,719
JERRY: That's increda.

1183
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,599
RYAN: I leap into the cat's mind.

1184
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:16,799
(laughter)

1185
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,880
JERRY: You make your home in its brainpan.

1186
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,619
AMY: This actually might be fine because if I get revealed then I'll just...

1187
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:24,779
AMY: sweet my way out of the cat. RYAN: This is what you always wanted.

1188
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,860
JERRY: Are you using your dice?

1189
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,980
AMY: No! And I got 12! RYAN: Holy shit!

1190
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,940
JERRY: Okay. KRIS: Wow.

1191
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,139
RYAN: I forgot about the plus ten.

1192
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:35,159
KATE: Could be worse. JERRY: So as you're picking you're way through...

1193
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:36,219
AMY: Yes.

1194
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:39,500
JERRY: Everyone has moved through the back.

1195
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:40,420
AMY: Yes.

1196
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,900
JERRY: Except for Walnut Dankgrass.

1197
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:50,300
So you noticed something strange about this cat as you're sort of-- as you are...

1198
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,239
JERRY: Aside from the size, obviously. AMY: Sure.

1199
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:54,299
JERRY: As you're moving beneath it--

1200
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:00,559
This is not out of the ordinary. It does happen, it's rare.

1201
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:03,960
The cat has six toes.

1202
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,720
AMY: Ah yes. KATE: (gasp) Polydactyl.

1203
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:07,919
JERRY: Right? RYAN: (whispering) I don't know what that is.

1204
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:09,299
JERRY: Six toes.

1205
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,380
RYAN: Oh. KATE: It means multiple dactyls.

1206
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,960
AMY: Means it's-- RYAN: Oh wow.

1207
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,199
JERRY: And so as you are coming around the edge,

1208
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:16,599
AMY: Oh no. JERRY: navigating this edge.

1209
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:20,460
JERRY: Your cloak catches on the back claw.

1210
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,880
KRIS: Oh no. KATE: Classic.

1211
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,500
KRIS: The one that doesn't do anything. Just there. RYAN: You got caught by the pterodactyl.

1212
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,159
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. The vestigial-- AMY: Well actually...

1213
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,159
KRIS: Blegh. AMY: Walnut doesn't wear a cloak.

1214
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:29,439
KATE: (gasp) AMY: But, yes.

1215
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,900
RYAN: Then your hair. AMY: Some article of clothing.

1216
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,639
RYAN: Your hair-- AMY: Walnut has short hair also.

1217
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,159
RYAN: Some hair though. AMY: Yes.

1218
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:36,119
KRIS: Then you escape.

1219
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:38,000
(laughter)

1220
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:45,820
JERRY: So the three of you; so you, K'thriss, and Donaar have moved past and you have gotten caught...

1221
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,139
KRIS: (whispering) Oh no.

1222
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:53,759
JERRY: by the back hook of this extra vestigial claw.

1223
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,480
KRIS: The yucky one. RYAN: The pterodactyl.

1224
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,240
AMY: Okay can I--

1225
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:03,519
JERRY: It rears up. You know how when cats get surprised it jump up in the air? It takes flight.

1226
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:05,500
AMY: Am I on the back foot or the front foot? JERRY: Back foot.

1227
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,460
AMY: Okay. I want to let go of my mouse and try and climb the cat?

1228
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,880
KRIS: Wow. JERRY: Climb the cat?

1229
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,980
KRIS: Who are you? AMY: I want to whisper in this thing's ear!

1230
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,559
RYAN: Oh man. JERRY: All right. Okay.

1231
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,019
AMY: What's the worst thing that happens? I die and you get a funnier person here.

1232
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:20,800
KRIS: I was going to say--

1233
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,660
(laughter)

1234
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:27,519
RYAN: Well we would get-- franchise-wise... this is a good question.

1235
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:30,980
KATE: Let's say 33.3% each. I go, bye! RYAN: That's 33.3. I say, good luck!

1236
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:34,920
RYAN: I believe in you! KRIS: I say, and that whip hurt! As I dart past.

1237
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,200
(laughter)

1238
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:37,439
JERRY: Dissonant Whispers. KRIS: Yep.

1239
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,860
JERRY: Yeah you can climb. You can do whatever you want and I'll roll with it.

1240
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,740
AMY: Well, would I-- I don't know but maybe Walnut would know...

1241
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:46,819
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: I mean...

1242
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,139
JERRY: She probably does if it's about beasts.

1243
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:51,420
AMY: If I'm touching the cat I can probably speak with it, right?

1244
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,099
JERRY: Yeah.

1245
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:54,860
AMY: Okay then maybe I don't need to climb it. But I want to grab on to it.

1246
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,220
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: I'm on.

1247
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:03,140
AMY: And at this point, I want to use Speak with Animals to try and communicate with this cat.

1248
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:05,400
KATE: I been waiting. This is the money shot right here. RYAN: (claps) This is all we wanted.

1249
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,800
KRIS: This is Hollywood Mouse. JERRY: This is the D&amp;D equivalent.

1250
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,640
KATE: Whew. RYAN: And the cat goes, fuck you.

1251
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:11,319
(laughter)

1252
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:14,759
KATE: Fuckity fuck meow! RYAN: Meow. Meow, fuck you, meow.

1253
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,480
JERRY: So you have an audience with this cat.

1254
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,340
AMY: So I say-- JERRY: So you're going to hang on to its back leg?

1255
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,420
AMY: Yeah I just want to hold on to it.

1256
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:27,039
AMY: I say--

1257
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:33,019
JERRY: It's just like-- It'll fling you off. Try to imagine trying to hold on to a dragon's leg.

1258
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:35,099
AMY: Oh I thought I was clawed on to it.

1259
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:37,319
JERRY: Oh no, you just-- AMY: I just nudged it.

1260
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,360
JERRY: Yeah it got hooked and dragged out. AMY: Well I'm exposed. Fine then I'm here.

1261
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,780
AMY: I'm at the mercy of this cat. And I would like to say to this cat,

1262
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:54,740
Friend, who brought me not one, but two mice in friendship not long ago.

1263
01:02:56,699 --> 01:02:58,500
I'm here. May I speak with you?

1264
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:00,539
We'll see!

1265
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,800
JERRY: So it...

1266
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,579
KRIS: Tell it, look at the bounty I have brought you!

1267
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:06,880
(laughter)

1268
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,820
KRIS: Two you bring...

1269
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:08,940
RYAN: You should say--

1270
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,159
JERRY: No, no. You have brought me two...

1271
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,019
And I have given four.

1272
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:15,179
(laughter)

1273
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:16,779
KRIS: Right. Two upon two.

1274
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:20,400
AMY: That's a different type of druid than that. RYAN: I also hate Mondays and love lasagna.

1275
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,200
JERRY: Yeah exactly.

1276
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,199
KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: Cat joke.

1277
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,759
JERRY: It gets down...

1278
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,280
It hears the voice and you can tell that the claw, like the swipe is ready.

1279
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:36,780
And then it puts the claw, like the paw's right by you.

1280
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:40,780
And you can hear the claws enter the sheath.

1281
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:42,380
And it says,

1282
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:45,920
"This is how you repay me?"

1283
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,720
"In league with these mice?"

1284
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:53,679
AMY: I say...

1285
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,340
JERRY: "Were you a mouse when I knew you before?"

1286
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,180
AMY: I have nev-- JERRY: "Have you always been a mouse?"

1287
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,699
JERRY: "What is the extent of your trickery?"

1288
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:05,539
AMY: I say, friend, you know me.

1289
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:10,259
I have not been a mouse long. And it is not by choice.

1290
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:11,940
However...

1291
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:22,419
you have been going to the food place and it seems you always find in your mouth their queen.

1292
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,860
And so...

1293
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,900
KRIS: (exhale) KATE: (whispering) Oh shit! Calling it out.

1294
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:32,680
AMY: And so in exchange for my help

1295
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:40,399
these mice have promised to take us to a place where we can become un-mice.

1296
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,719
KRIS: It's okay. Cats understand that.

1297
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:46,559
KRIS: They know what that means.

1298
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,639
RYAN: We could have fed the mice to him and gotten his help.

1299
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,119
AMY: Different type of druid!

1300
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,280
This is how Wally rolls.

1301
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,300
RYAN: I know. KATE: (whispering) Wally!

1302
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,620
RYAN: I should have tried to persuade you. KRIS: (whispering) Wally?

1303
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,920
KATE: (whispering) It's so cute!

1304
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,680
AMY: So I have-- we got--

1305
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,579
JERRY: What case are you trying to make to this mouse?

1306
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:02,860
AMY: To this cat.

1307
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:10,720
JERRY: Yeah to this cat. Thus far I would say that this argumentation does not compel.

1308
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,760
AMY: I'm trying to say, it killed...

1309
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,760
Listen you have killed not once, not twice, but many, many times their queen.

1310
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:23,079
You kind of owe them one.

1311
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,760
KRIS: Ooh. RYAN: Err.

1312
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,540
AMY: I'm asking... KRIS: I don't know if that's going to play.

1313
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:31,599
AMY: I'm asking for a personal favor. JERRY: "I owe... a mouse?"

1314
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:32,299
RYAN: Yep.

1315
01:05:33,579 --> 01:05:35,699
AMY: Well not one. JERRY: "You are a mouse."

1316
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,980
AMY: I'm not-- You know-- JERRY: "What do I owe you?"

1317
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,039
AMY: You owe me nothing.

1318
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:44,519
JERRY: It puts its paw on your chest.

1319
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:45,320
AMY: Sure.

1320
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:50,519
JERRY: And just pushes you down directly on to the ground.

1321
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,719
AMY: Great. At which point I use Animal Friendship.

1322
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:56,939
This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm.

1323
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,200
KRIS: I don't think it was worried about that.

1324
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:01,179
RYAN: I don't think it was worried that you meant it harm in the first place.

1325
01:06:01,179 --> 01:06:02,980
AMY: (sigh) KRIS: Okay I'm sorry. Keep reading.

1326
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:03,719
RYAN: Sorry yeah.

1327
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:05,339
AMY: This is my thing. KATE: Be a friend. Be a friend.

1328
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:08,300
AMY: If I'm going to mess it up, let me dig my own grave, please.

1329
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,580
AMY: All right, so-- JERRY: I use my gravedigger.

1330
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:11,799
AMY: I use my gravedigger-- JERRY: Talent.

1331
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,360
AMY: Actually that's not-- All right fine.

1332
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,220
JERRY: Auto-gravedigging.

1333
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:18,799
AMY: Whatever I take it back. This is the one time you're going to let me take it back.

1334
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,780
Instead I use Enhance Ability to give myself advantage on charisma checks.

1335
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,920
KATE: Ooh.

1336
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:27,559
JERRY: Interesting... AMY: At which point I would like to now...

1337
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:29,539
KATE: Speak with a very charismatic mouse. AMY: persuade the cat.

1338
01:06:29,539 --> 01:06:35,820
AMY: And I would like to play to what I assume is probably a very vain existence, because let's be honest.

1339
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:36,740
KATE: Here we go. Here we go! AMY: And I say,

1340
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:38,639
AMY: I say, friend.

1341
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,440
Beautiful, beautiful friend.

1342
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:49,279
I know it is through your lands that we pass. This is your territory. I'm at the mercy of you.

1343
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,360
JERRY: "Yes." AMY: I am only asking--

1344
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:52,500
JERRY: "Yes."

1345
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:56,239
AMY: That you, in all of your greatness...

1346
01:06:56,239 --> 01:06:57,139
JERRY: "Glory."

1347
01:06:57,139 --> 01:06:58,579
AMY: Glory. Of course.

1348
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:00,299
JERRY: "Felinity." AMY: Great glory.

1349
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:01,559
AMY: Felinity.

1350
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,519
JERRY: "Cathood."

1351
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,559
AMY: Cathood.

1352
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:04,519
KATE: Liquidity.

1353
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:05,960
JERRY: No. AMY: Liquidity. Equity? I don't know.

1354
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,139
KRIS: Moisture. RYAN: Liquid.

1355
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:08,819
AMY: Fuzziness. RYAN: ROI?

1356
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,480
JERRY: 2.1?

1357
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:19,160
AMY: Merely that you let us pass this day, and no other days, into the lands beyond.

1358
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:26,800
As we have found ourselves turned into the form you see now and wish to return to normal.

1359
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:34,400
That is the extent of my grovelling.

1360
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,160
JERRY: Let me see it. So right now you are at disadvantage, like I said.

1361
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:38,879
AMY: Sure.

1362
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,340
JERRY: You can buy yourself to one dice.

1363
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,920
AMY: I'm going to use the advantage.

1364
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,260
JERRY: I recommend that you do.

1365
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,320
Now...

1366
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,559
AMY: But I get-- JERRY: Let's see it.

1367
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,699
AMY: So I get advantage...

1368
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,900
RYAN: Well that just makes you back to even. KATE: Can you use Forest Friends?

1369
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,300
AMY: I don't think Forest Friends is going to help me here.

1370
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,340
I'm not going to bring out a bunch of things for this cat to--

1371
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,860
RYAN: Ooh that would be a good idea.

1372
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,360
JERRY: That's one way to do it. KRIS: Meats from the forest!

1373
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,660
KATE: You call Forest Friends and all the mice comes for the cat.

1374
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:07,440
KATE: (whispering) What if? AMY: (laughing) What kind of druid do you think I am?

1375
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:12,420
JERRY: Potentially a druid that's aware, at some level, of the natural order.

1376
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,180
AMY: I know. I also--

1377
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:17,420
JERRY: So it's like this... KRIS: I love this, Amy. I legitimately love this.

1378
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,340
RYAN: This is great.

1379
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,199
JERRY: There is the weight of this paw on you.

1380
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,720
AMY: Yes. JERRY: Let's see the dice.

1381
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,199
AMY: Okay. So I use one of my special advantages from the crowd.

1382
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:30,699
And also I have advantage on charisma checks. I'm assuming this is going to be a charisma check?

1383
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:32,800
JERRY: Yeah exactly. AMY: So I would actually have advantage.

1384
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,699
JERRY: You boughten your way completely out of it now.

1385
01:08:34,699 --> 01:08:36,139
AMY: I just want to make sure and no one's going to be--

1386
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,920
Oh! Don't worry. Plus nothing.

1387
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,079
RYAN: Oh hey. Persuasion.

1388
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:41,019
AMY: Big money. RYAN: Nice.

1389
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,760
AMY: That's 18, right?

1390
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,360
KATE: Yeah. AMY: I just want to see if I can do better.

1391
01:08:44,739 --> 01:08:46,739
AMY: She can't. It was an 18. KATE: Nice.

1392
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,520
JERRY: The weight comes up a bit.

1393
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,500
AMY: K.

1394
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,600
JERRY: And Onyx says,

1395
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:07,480
"I have known you in two worlds. Maybe more. I may meet you in a third."

1396
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:12,720
"When this happens, I will expect payment."

1397
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,379
AMY: I will take that deal.

1398
01:09:17,739 --> 01:09:20,000
Absolutely. You have my word.

1399
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,860
JERRY: The paw comes up.

1400
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,420
Paw down here.

1401
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,220
Looks around a little bit. Says,

1402
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,819
"You may go but your mice are forfeit."

1403
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,960
RYAN: Well he can't see us still, right? He can only see her?

1404
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,199
JERRY: Well the mice that you allied with, certainly.

1405
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:42,000
RYAN: Oh okay.

1406
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:48,859
AMY: We... we need our mice to be able to leave.

1407
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:52,539
They're not our mice. They're just the mice.

1408
01:09:52,539 --> 01:09:55,939
KRIS: Can we parlay this into a ride on the cat's back?

1409
01:09:55,939 --> 01:09:57,939
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: Perhaps?

1410
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,040
KRIS: We can cover more ground. AMY: How about this.

1411
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:01,579
JERRY: Cat ride? AMY: How about this.

1412
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,480
AMY: I agree. KRIS: Upgrade.

1413
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:05,079
AMY: The mice are forfeit.

1414
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,140
However you being such a great hunter,

1415
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:12,360
it would be no sport for you take them when they're right under your feet.

1416
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:15,019
You, who enjoys the hunt so much.

1417
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:22,280
If you will take us the rest of the way, you can be free to hunt these mice to your heart content.

1418
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,180
AMY: I will roll again for that. You want me to? JERRY: Let's do it. Let's see it.

1419
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,360
AMY: Got nothing left. RYAN: Yeah so you have disadvantage.

1420
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:31,259
AMY: So I'm at true dis-- Nope. I'm just at blank.

1421
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:32,579
Please!

1422
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,060
20!

1423
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,620
RYAN: Hey! KATE: Oh!

1424
01:10:36,619 --> 01:10:37,840
AMY: That's never happened ever!

1425
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,539
KATE: (grunting) Yes!

1426
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,780
AMY: That's so good! For me. I'm a bad roller. (laughs)

1427
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:47,800
JERRY: So you guys are ahead of this. You can see this conversation.

1428
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,980
I mean your hand is on your greatsword. You're ready to kill cats.

1429
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:57,219
RYAN: I'm bringing those acid up. Like, oh boy. Bleh. Bleh. Bleh. Bleh.

1430
01:10:57,659 --> 01:11:00,139
KRIS: I dial 9-1 on my sigil.

1431
01:11:01,539 --> 01:11:05,039
KATE: I hear this conversation and I start to say my goodbyes to my mouse.

1432
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:08,039
JERRY: Yeah exactly. KATE: Well it's been so nice.

1433
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:11,619
JERRY: Good pets. Good pets for everybody. We're going to pet two mice. Let's do two mice at once.

1434
01:11:11,619 --> 01:11:12,760
KATE: Two mice. Two mice.

1435
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,340
JERRY: So you are-- it's like a contact juggling thing, like a David Bowie thing.

1436
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:23,239
Like you just have your chunk, your geometric shape--

1437
01:11:23,239 --> 01:11:25,119
KRIS: Yeah. I may not even be aware that I did it.

1438
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:29,439
JERRY: Yeah you don't even know. You're just watching this happen. You're ready.

1439
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:32,319
You see she's pushed into the ground.

1440
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:35,199
You see it lessen.

1441
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,760
You see it come back like this.

1442
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:41,359
And then you see the two of them walking toward the door.

1443
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,460
And then you see it get down on its haunches, and you feel that same rumble.

1444
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:50,739
As soon as its belly touches the wood.

1445
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,019
KRIS: The purr.

1446
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,280
JERRY: You feel that rumble again in the wood.

1447
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,099
RYAN: Cats purr?

1448
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,260
KRIS: That's a great twist. That's good short story writing.

1449
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,440
JERRY: I'm a professional. I ain't fuck around.

1450
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:04,639
AMY: If you bring up a purr in act 20 you got to--

1451
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,680
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KRIS/RYAN: Chekhov's purr.

1452
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,920
RYAN: Damn it. You got there first.

1453
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,420
JERRY: No. That was the purr that was on the mantle.

1454
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,260
RYAN: Yeah.

1455
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,500
JERRY: The mantle purr.

1456
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:17,560
Anyway, that's the situation. You can get right on that haunch.

1457
01:12:17,859 --> 01:12:20,059
RYAN: Yeah. I go for the haunches. JERRY: If you will.

1458
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,200
RYAN: Dibs. Haunch dib.

1459
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:25,340
JERRY: The mice do not understand what's happening right now.

1460
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:28,619
AMY: So I still have some time left, to what I'm assuming that didn't take--

1461
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:29,840
JERRY: About ten minutes?

1462
01:12:31,579 --> 01:12:36,019
AMY: Now I don't know this, but Walnut would know this, so I'm going to ask you.

1463
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:36,840
JERRY: Yeah.

1464
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,720
AMY: If I speak to the mice, will the cat be able to understand it?

1465
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,760
JERRY: Mm-mmm. Mice don't speak cat, and vice versa.

1466
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,300
AMY: Great, so I look at the mice,

1467
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,659
RYAN: That's why they fight so much. AMY: and I say--

1468
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,359
JERRY: Yeah exactly, at the end of the day-- RYAN: Communication.

1469
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,979
RYAN: You know, this is just an allegory...

1470
01:12:48,979 --> 01:12:52,279
JERRY: Isn't that the issue? They're at loggerheads. It's about language.

1471
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:56,039
AMY: So I just want to look down at them as we're climbing up, and I say,

1472
01:12:56,039 --> 01:13:01,819
I bought your freedom for now. Do not go back to your old home. That is the food place.

1473
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:05,559
I bought you this chance to find a new home. And a new queen.

1474
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,340
And then I start quoting Watership Down to them because--

1475
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,619
JERRY: You start talking about flayrah...

1476
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:14,760
AMY: And then I say, you know he will eat you but first he has to catch you.

1477
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:18,420
And then I say maybe like fly you fools, or something. Just turn them away.

1478
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,480
RYAN: And they say, didn't we hire you to kill this thing?

1479
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:24,099
As they run away, this is not what we thought this to be.

1480
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,900
KRIS: Okay I guess we'll move. All right.

1481
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:33,979
JERRY: You see their eyes glisten like jewels in the dim light and they break off in three different directions.

1482
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:34,900
AMY: Bye.

1483
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,599
KATE: Goodbye. They did call that one, by the way.

1484
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,480
KATE: They were like Far Mice usually fuck us over. JERRY: Far Mice are full of fucking shit!

1485
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:43,299
KATE: Yeah we kind of did it. RYAN: Happened again.

1486
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:44,939
KATE: Sorry. KRIS: At the end of the day they're mice.

1487
01:13:44,939 --> 01:13:47,539
RYAN: Yeah. I say, I don't care. You're a dumb mouse.

1488
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,220
And I'm a dragon man.

1489
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,199
KRIS: Thanks for the ride.

1490
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,699
AMY: My life's more important than yours. RYAN: Yeah.

1491
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:53,859
JERRY: That's what's going on.

1492
01:13:53,859 --> 01:13:55,279
KRIS: I put my cigarette out on its forehead.

1493
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:56,199
(laughter)

1494
01:13:56,199 --> 01:14:00,760
RYAN: I kick it as I get off with my spurs. Ugh. On to a bigger animal. Whatever.

1495
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,800
AMY: I've been thinking about this problem all week.

1496
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,739
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. RYAN: I know.

1497
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:07,539
AMY: Talked it over with my mother, my grandmother...

1498
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:09,680
JERRY: Yeah. What did they suggest? RYAN: Us?

1499
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,240
AMY: Try and convince the cat it was the mice's new queen. Which...

1500
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:14,479
RYAN: Ah that would have been funny too.

1501
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:16,719
AMY: I don't think that's a level for K'thriss to have those spells yet.

1502
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,900
KRIS: What the heck. I don't think that's ever in my purview.

1503
01:14:18,899 --> 01:14:20,279
KATE: Could Rosie have done that? Sorry we're metagaming.

1504
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:21,399
RYAN: Yeah we're going to--

1505
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:24,559
AMY: I just want you guys to know there's been a lot of stress in my life.

1506
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,760
JERRY: But fully three generations of Falcones had to be engaged on this problem.

1507
01:14:30,859 --> 01:14:37,299
The cat is languorously moves the rest of the way.

1508
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:41,480
It's a easy, smooth ride. It's like the shocks are there.

1509
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:44,239
It lowers you down.

1510
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:51,000
And this door is not open but you can easily go underneath it.

1511
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:58,779
And you can see that telltale, black, cool dark underneath the lip of the door.

1512
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:05,519
As you're scooting yourself underneath the door to move out, you can see just the cat's mouth.

1513
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:07,880
And it says, "Remember."

1514
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,220
AMY: Mmm okay.

1515
01:15:10,819 --> 01:15:13,179
AMY: On my way out... JERRY: Yeah I kill the cat.

1516
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,140
AMY: I got to do something real quick.

1517
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,520
JERRY: Cat Exploder. AMY: It's a cantrip so it doesn't matter.

1518
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,480
AMY: On my way out, to give the mice a fighting chance,

1519
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:22,639
because I did promise I would give them a fighting chance, I use Druidcraft,

1520
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,880
which allows me to mimic the sound of a small animal.

1521
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,539
And so very near the cat, but not too near, I want to mimic the sound of a mouse.

1522
01:15:32,539 --> 01:15:35,539
And that's my parting gift to the mice, so I feel as though I kept my word.

1523
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,360
JERRY: You see the cat's mouth curl up into a smile.

1524
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:44,079
And it wheels away from where you have visibility in it.

1525
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,480
KATE: Whatever helps you sleep at night.

1526
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:48,619
KATE: (laughs) RYAN: Yeah really this was all morality play.

1527
01:15:48,619 --> 01:15:52,519
AMY: You know what. When you guys have a moral conundrum, I'll be sure to make fun of you too.

1528
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,780
KRIS: It's like a fable. KATE: I know.

1529
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:56,399
KRIS: It's like a fable we just watched happen.

1530
01:15:56,399 --> 01:15:59,179
RYAN: I legit live pragmatic dragon terms.

1531
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,420
JERRY: I was-- I don't know. I had a super good time.

1532
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:06,340
JERRY: In any case, the classic thing you have experienced it multiple times now.

1533
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:14,840
That pressure shift each time you enter a new version of this construct.

1534
01:16:15,979 --> 01:16:17,919
KRIS: This time the Homeward Light is on the ceiling!

1535
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,340
Or we're on the top floor! Oh!

1536
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,819
JERRY: It's all gelatin!

1537
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,200
No, no, no.

1538
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,260
As you pass through underneath...

1539
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:37,319
you enter the upper half-circle where the doors and rooms are.

1540
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:42,319
And you look down into the place proper.

1541
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,659
You can still see the chandelier has its classic configuration.

1542
01:16:46,659 --> 01:16:48,399
It doesn't really change at all.

1543
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:53,619
Like that seems to be the North Star of this construct. You always know where it's going to be.

1544
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,420
And you see three people...

1545
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,880
around this table...

1546
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,679
just seated at the bar.

1547
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,460
Plates of food in front of them.

1548
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:17,760
And as you enter laying down, of course, as you get back up and look over the edge,

1549
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:22,539
the three of them raise their glasses and say, "Hey!"

1550
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:26,819
PLAYERS: (unenthusiastically) Hey...

1551
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:28,639
KRIS: I have my hand on my sigil. RYAN: Dusting myself.

1552
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,020
RYAN: Hey, hey. KATE: Hey...

1553
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,380
RYAN: Mouse fur on me. KRIS: Can I kill these guys now?

1554
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,619
KATE: What do these people look like?

1555
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,800
JERRY: They look like...

1556
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,819
RYAN: Does Kris recognize them?

1557
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:43,180
JERRY: Professional adventurers from the looks of it.

1558
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:43,980
RYAN/KATE: Okay.

1559
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:51,899
JERRY: Obviously different skill sets, different traditions than your party. But no less valid.

1560
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:53,939
You know, these are choices that people make.

1561
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:58,399
One person-- obviously K'thriss is a warlock.

1562
01:17:58,659 --> 01:18:07,039
His approach to the mystic arts involves a pact with an entity of some kind.

1563
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:10,139
It's a power transfer type of arrangement.

1564
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:17,780
This is clearly someone who engages with magic in a more studious, studied way.

1565
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:25,860
There is someone who is dressed in platemail seated at the table.

1566
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:34,819
And there is also someone in light, loose-fitting leather armor with their hood pulled back.

1567
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,659
KATE: I'm going to point to them and go, Far Mice?

1568
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:42,099
JERRY: The um...

1569
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,020
KRIS/KATE/RYAN: Yeah...?

1570
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,020
JERRY: They look back and forth and laugh.

1571
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:49,179
KATE: Yeah... RYAN: Yeah.

1572
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,020
JERRY: Right? KATE: Us too.

1573
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,000
RYAN: I put my hand on my sword. Because I don't--

1574
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,340
I've had enough of this fucking place.

1575
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:55,680
(laughter)

1576
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:59,300
If I don't trust a door, I sure as shit don't trust three randos at a table.

1577
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:05,015
JERRY: Yeah exactly. It's like where's the fucking basement floor here? Right?

1578
01:19:05,015 --> 01:19:07,532
One thing that you do notice that is strange.

1579
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:14,519
Immediately. I mean, aside from the fact that you've been stuck for literally three days now.

1580
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:18,939
Multiple rests, you have lived inside this construct.

1581
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:25,159
There is something unique here and you don't think it's a part of the original set of this place.

1582
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:33,059
Many of the chairs and one of the tables from the common room environment

1583
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:39,760
have been pushed up against the door to barricade it.

1584
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:44,099
KATE: That's not great.

1585
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:48,340
I immediately go into helpless old lady mode.

1586
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:50,479
JERRY: Oh nice. KATE: Which is great.

1587
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:51,679
JERRY: It's not true.

1588
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,079
KATE: No. No, no, no, but they don't know that though.

1589
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:56,380
JERRY: We've seen it. I know where the DPS comes from.

1590
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:04,380
KATE: I'm going to lean heavily on my quarterstaff and make my way over to the table and ask the studious one

1591
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:10,740
how they managed to find themselves in this particular version of this construct.

1592
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:14,960
JERRY: "Well... tell me if this sounds familiar."

1593
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:21,839
"You entered into a contract with Acquisitions Incorporated..."

1594
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:28,479
"You went where they told you to go and there was no one there."

1595
01:20:28,979 --> 01:20:30,639
"And then you left that place."

1596
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:35,819
"But you didn't really leave it and you went to another version of it."

1597
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,400
"And then you went to another version of it."

1598
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,300
"And then you went to another version of it except you were small."

1599
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:46,199
"Is that the same?"

1600
01:20:46,199 --> 01:20:48,420
JERRY: And the... KRIS: That's relatable.

1601
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:51,020
JERRY: The fellow... KATE: Universal experience.

1602
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:56,039
JERRY: She, this is the wizard, she is like,

1603
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:00,159
"Yeah. We've been around the block a couple times on this."

1604
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,460
And the knight just sort of like grunts

1605
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:06,760
and you can see him just like shoveling the last couple bites of food from the plate into his mouth.

1606
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:08,819
KATE: You guys are pretty hungry right?

1607
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:10,939
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Does that food look good to you?

1608
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:13,640
RYAN: Oh yeah. That mouse was looking good to me.

1609
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,420
KATE: Yeah.

1610
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:19,859
JERRY: No, no. The one with the hood draped back...

1611
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,400
Slight frame, but you know that that's not an indication.

1612
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:28,759
You're way past making that type of judgement.

1613
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:33,000
Just cracked like a whip. It's just a different musculature end to end.

1614
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,560
She gestures over to the bar and says,

1615
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,240
"I want to show you a trick, grab a plate."

1616
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,640
KATE: Okay. RYAN: I'll say,

1617
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,920
RYAN: I've gotten this far in this house by trusting strangers,

1618
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:43,940
RYAN: so me first. KRIS: And objects.

1619
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:46,199
RYAN: Yeah. And then the plate bites me.

1620
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:47,179
(laughter)

1621
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:49,159
KRIS: I put my hand near the plate's mouth. KATE: And you're immediately in love.

1622
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:51,299
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: No no. Exactly.

1623
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:55,779
JERRY: It's just like you just have it, you just hold it close. So close.

1624
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:57,899
KATE: I thought it would never happen to me again. RYAN: Yeah.

1625
01:21:57,899 --> 01:21:59,159
KRIS: A chance to make it right.

1626
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,659
JERRY: Well no, I mean, you can see it, this is the point

1627
01:22:01,659 --> 01:22:05,899
at which it becomes like a Behind the Music black and white flashback.

1628
01:22:05,899 --> 01:22:09,539
It's like, this is where it all went wrong for Donaar Blit'zen.

1629
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:13,659
His heart was broken by a door. He moved on to cutlery.

1630
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:17,119
RYAN: I was fed up with this place when we were in the first room talking to the bartender.

1631
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:19,220
I'm like beyond fed up with it now.

1632
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:20,960
KRIS: I'm rich, I don't need to work. RYAN: Yeah.

1633
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,619
KRIS: I don't want any of this. RYAN: Yeah.

1634
01:22:22,619 --> 01:22:24,619
KATE: So you've grabbed a magical plate.

1635
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:28,899
RYAN: I'm really hungry. I don't want to do any of this at all but I'm like blinded by hunger.

1636
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:31,599
KRIS: I'm going to take a plate too because I was interested in that glass that I held.

1637
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,340
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. So you grab the plate.

1638
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,340
RYAN: Yeah, and then I say, all right.

1639
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:40,699
JERRY: He's like "Set it down. Just set it down on any table. Any table! Just set it down on a table!"

1640
01:22:41,319 --> 01:22:43,179
As soon as you set it down...

1641
01:22:44,194 --> 01:22:49,699
Imagine like when you've flipped a coin and it hits a table and sort of spins, like this...

1642
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:57,880
You set it down, it flips, it jumps over, and sort of rolls like a coin and by the time it's done it's full of food.

1643
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,340
RYAN: What kind of food?

1644
01:22:59,819 --> 01:23:07,119
JERRY: It's a mixture, this particular one looks to be a stew. Almost like a shepherd's pie type thing.

1645
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:09,019
Like a stew on mashed potatoes

1646
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:11,340
KRIS: Oh nice. KATE: I'm getting hungry for real.

1647
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,480
RYAN: Yum. (smacks lips) Ooh yum, yum, yum.

1648
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,500
I say, ooh, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1649
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,319
(laughter) KRIS: Roll for it.

1650
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:18,880
RYAN: I just go (eating sounds)

1651
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,159
Oh I fail. I miss, hit my eye.

1652
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:22,519
KRIS: You say, yup, yup.

1653
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,560
KRIS: And they don't know what that means. KATE: That's nothing.

1654
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,820
JERRY: Give me a constitu... Nah, I'm just...

1655
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:28,979
AMY: I was like, come on. RYAN: Actually, yeah I should like--

1656
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:30,639
JERRY: No, no, no. There's-- RYAN: No, I know.

1657
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,079
RYAN: I've learned my lesson with the door.

1658
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:36,420
I sniff it, I examine it, incredulously. I say, wuh?

1659
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:44,119
JERRY: You place your dragonborn snout right over the top and just draw it in.

1660
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:49,060
There isn't anything wrong with it that you can tell. You think that this might be food.

1661
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:53,079
You don't know why it comes-- you don't know why the plate flipped and did all this shit.

1662
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,400
But you think that this is food.

1663
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:57,119
RYAN: All right.

1664
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:59,399
AMY: I mean, I would have added more rosemary but yeah there's nothing wrong with it.

1665
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:03,859
RYAN: I'll-- JERRY: It's like 3.2 on Yelp.

1666
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,220
RYAN: I go, huddle up! Huddle up!

1667
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,220
And then we all gather around the plate.

1668
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:11,220
Then I go, I'm gonna eat this first. I will take this bullet.

1669
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,480
RYAN: Because I'm immune to diseases. KRIS: Okay. Right.

1670
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:15,119
RYAN: And I'm really, really hungry, guys.

1671
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:16,559
(whispering) And I don't trust these three.

1672
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:17,779
KATE: Yeah. RYAN: I don't trust these three.

1673
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:19,079
KATE: You guys can eat. RYAN: (shouting) I don't trust these three!

1674
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:20,619
And then I go, om! (laughter)

1675
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:22,439
JERRY: They laugh. RYAN: And then I go, om!

1676
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,579
RYAN: (eating noises) Oh it's really good.

1677
01:24:24,579 --> 01:24:27,119
RYAN: Do I think it's good? And I'm like-- (eating noises) JERRY: Oh, no, no.

1678
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:31,199
JERRY: This is absolutely-- this is 100% food. Do you finish the plate?

1679
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,899
RYAN: Hell yeah! And now I'm no longer disadvantaged.

1680
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:35,719
JERRY: As soon as-- (laughter)

1681
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,440
JERRY: As soon as you scrape up the last bite... KATE: Uh oh.

1682
01:24:38,859 --> 01:24:40,739
JERRY: And put it into your craw zone.

1683
01:24:41,939 --> 01:24:46,000
It jumps, flips, and refills

1684
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,399
RYAN: Nice!

1685
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,360
KATE: My natural-- RYAN: I eat the second plate.

1686
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:53,179
(laughter) RYAN: And then I go, (eating noises)

1687
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,039
KATE: And then what?

1688
01:24:54,039 --> 01:24:56,340
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: And then the third one.

1689
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,000
RYAN: We've got an hour left! JERRY: Yeah but how many are you going to eat?

1690
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,260
KRIS: You glutton!

1691
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:03,199
KATE: Rosie... KRIS: That's the circle of hell we're in. Enjoy.

1692
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,199
KATE: I want my companions to eat.

1693
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,300
Because clearly this joker is having no problem with it.

1694
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:11,619
But I have a natural suspicion from 120 years on this, this great--

1695
01:25:11,619 --> 01:25:15,159
JERRY: Yeah, particularly where food from strangers is involved.

1696
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:16,739
KATE: Yeah, not super trusting.

1697
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:20,579
So I'm going to continue to engage them in polite conversation and try to figure out

1698
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:23,439
why we are both here.

1699
01:25:23,899 --> 01:25:28,759
Do they still have their letters? Can I ask them to see their letters from Acquisitions Inc?

1700
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,440
JERRY: Oh. AMY: But didn't they dissolve?

1701
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:32,460
KATE/RYAN/JERRY: The nuts did. KRIS: The acorns did.

1702
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:35,199
KATE: Yeah. But if they've got-- Can we compare letters? See if they're identical?

1703
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,199
JERRY: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. They all come out.

1704
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,199
JERRY: They just slap them down. KATE: Right.

1705
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:42,319
JERRY: 25, 25, 25. &gt;&gt; KATE: Uh oh. KRIS: The letters immediately fill with food!

1706
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:44,380
KATE: Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! RYAN: Hey, where's your fourth guy?

1707
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,000
KATE: Yes, so these numbers don't add up! What happened to...

1708
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,579
AMY: Where's your fourth? KATE: What happened to number four if I may ask?

1709
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:51,019
JERRY: "Let me tell you."

1710
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,020
KATE: Please. RYAN: (eating noises) Hmm?

1711
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:55,020
KRIS: (sound of spitting food out) KATE: You're eating him.

1712
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,860
RYAN: No...! KATE: That's him!

1713
01:25:56,859 --> 01:25:58,139
JERRY: "So..."

1714
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:01,880
"What was your experience with Onyx?"

1715
01:26:02,539 --> 01:26:04,199
KATE: Oh! &gt;&gt; AMY: Great. JERRY: "Positive?"

1716
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:06,300
KATE: Yeah, Walnut had a very good time. AMY: "Paw-sitive."

1717
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:09,940
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Very-- I think it was a productive... interaction.

1718
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:12,879
AMY: I think that's fair. RYAN: We're indentured to him now. How about you?

1719
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,239
KRIS: You know, I don't like cats but I liked Onyx.

1720
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:17,079
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: "Yep."

1721
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:20,220
KATE: Onyx had a bend for death that we appreciated.

1722
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,260
RYAN: Yeah, I liked it more than the mice. KATE: How about you?

1723
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,680
RYAN: (muttering) Stupid mice. JERRY: The warrior...

1724
01:26:25,979 --> 01:26:28,539
JERRY: scrapes the last bit of the plate done.

1725
01:26:28,539 --> 01:26:32,960
It fills with food, he lifts up the plate and he just throws it behind the bar.

1726
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,500
KATE: Well that's disgusting

1727
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:38,280
JERRY: And he says, "The cat..." RYAN: We can do that?

1728
01:26:38,899 --> 01:26:41,839
JERRY: "was the frying pan. Are you familiar with the metaphor?"

1729
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:45,239
"The cat was the frying pan."

1730
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:50,420
"So, we came in to the top..."

1731
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:54,900
"deck of the inn."

1732
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:57,799
"Of this inn. Of this version of the inn."

1733
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,199
"Which I don't even think is an inn!"

1734
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:03,579
RYAN: I hear you. Yeah. KATE: You two would get along great.

1735
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,020
JERRY: Right? RYAN: And I throw my plate in solidarity!

1736
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,440
RYAN: Fuck this place. JERRY: Air high five.

1737
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:10,079
RYAN: This guy's awesome. KRIS: That's cool.

1738
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:12,479
RYAN: Hey I could be your last 25!

1739
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,619
JERRY: He said-- (laughter)

1740
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:19,520
"We came in and there was a dire wolf.

1741
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,820
KATE: Hmm.

1742
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,780
JERRY: "We slew the beast."

1743
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,159
RYAN: Nice. JERRY: "And it became a werewolf."

1744
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:30,159
JERRY: "And we slew that beast."

1745
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,880
"And then it became a wolfwere."

1746
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,880
The wizard laughs at this.

1747
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:40,960
KATE: It's funny. JERRY: "Then it was a wereshark."

1748
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,439
KATE: Nice! RYAN: Ah cool.

1749
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:49,279
JERRY: "And it went on like this for what must have been a ten-day. I don't know how long we fought."

1750
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,920
"Different..."

1751
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,280
"assholes..."

1752
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,700
"But when we defeated the last one,"

1753
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,360
"and I don't even remember what it was,"

1754
01:28:02,659 --> 01:28:04,099
"our friend lay dead."

1755
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:08,119
"But the inn changed."

1756
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,680
"There are fresh beds whenever you open a door."

1757
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:16,900
"There are-- there's hot food. Good food."

1758
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,920
"Every time you get a plate."

1759
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,340
"And I said,"

1760
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:26,199
"If I left here..."

1761
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:29,239
"I would be trying to earn money..."

1762
01:28:30,199 --> 01:28:31,380
"so that..."

1763
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:34,899
"I could have fresh beds and food."

1764
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:40,420
"And that's when it occurred to me that I didn't have to do it."

1765
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:50,239
"I think maybe being a lackey for Acquisitions Incorporated isn't in my business plan."

1766
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,579
KATE: How long have you been here?

1767
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:57,159
JERRY: You want to do an intuition check? KATE: Sure.

1768
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:03,699
KATE: I don't have it... What is the actual skill for intuition? I don't have that listed.

1769
01:29:03,699 --> 01:29:06,720
RYAN: Has anyone else eaten? AMY: Oh I'm eating.

1770
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,039
KATE: Perception?

1771
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:10,720
RYAN: If this goes south for some reason I don't want to be the only one in the boat.

1772
01:29:11,619 --> 01:29:13,180
KRIS: Oh I have a little more insight than that.

1773
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:15,360
RYAN: Oh the food congeals in your stomach and turns into a monster that rips out your chest.

1774
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:17,479
JERRY: Ten? &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah. KRIS: Am I within hearing range of that?

1775
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:20,299
JERRY: You want to get some? KRIS: Yeah. Let me take my advantage.

1776
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:24,180
KRIS: I'm going to need the advantage for that one...

1777
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,699
Ah... That will be a...

1778
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:29,460
What is that 12?

1779
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,140
KATE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; JERRY: Okay. KRIS: Yeah.

1780
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,880
JERRY: He says, "I don't know."

1781
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:35,839
"And I don't care."

1782
01:29:36,899 --> 01:29:37,839
KATE: Okay.

1783
01:29:39,699 --> 01:29:42,659
RYAN: How many nights have you slept? Ballpark.

1784
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:45,400
KATE: We're going to enjoy a brief meal.

1785
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:49,859
And then we'll join you perhaps for some chess.

1786
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,340
After this. In your beautiful inn.

1787
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,340
JERRY: "Mm-hmm." KATE: Okay.

1788
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,340
KATE: Good talk. JERRY: "All right."

1789
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:59,079
KATE: I think this inn requires blood sacrifice.

1790
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:00,079
JERRY: Okay.

1791
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:03,599
AMY: That was a big jump--

1792
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,720
AMY: Walnut just drops her spoon. RYAN: Yeah, wow. Jeez.

1793
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:11,000
JERRY: So she-- K'thriss and Rosie. He's in feast mode.

1794
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,380
K'thriss and Rosie are engaging with this group.

1795
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:17,699
I would like to get a perception check from you...

1796
01:30:17,699 --> 01:30:19,840
AMY: I bet you would. JERRY: Walnut.

1797
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:21,840
AMY: I bet you would. RYAN: You're eating too, right?

1798
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,100
JERRY: Yeah, you ate the food. Everybody's okay now.

1799
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,660
RYAN: Can we sleep?

1800
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,720
KATE: Oh my god. RYAN: 20! Wow look at you.

1801
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,619
AMY: 20. That's a 25. Sucka!

1802
01:30:30,619 --> 01:30:34,539
KATE: These rolls, my god. KRIS: What's going on over there?

1803
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,119
JERRY: You hear...

1804
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:39,079
So, while this is happening...

1805
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:43,359
I mean, it's noisy. There's clanking of plates and then...

1806
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,940
It's like a pie pan falling, like whenever these plates refill with food there's a ruckus.

1807
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:50,519
AMY: Mm-hmm. JERRY: Right?

1808
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:55,739
JERRY: The reason you can hear this is because it is very rhythmic.

1809
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:00,079
AMY: Oh no. Are we being like soothed to stay?

1810
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:01,800
JERRY: You hear like...

1811
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:03,739
(knocking on table - three rhythmic taps)

1812
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,920
(knocking on table - three rhythmic taps)

1813
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,739
(knocking on table - three rhythmic taps)

1814
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:11,699
AMY: Is it... JERRY: It's from upstairs.

1815
01:31:11,739 --> 01:31:13,800
AMY: Ah. Okay... RYAN: Ugh.

1816
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,920
KRIS: Ugh. AMY: I would...

1817
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,600
KRIS: Let's go. Right away. Up there. AMY: I would like to go investigate this noise.

1818
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,160
AMY: I mean it sounds like someone may be knocking.

1819
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:26,619
KATE: The door's also barricaded downstairs which is interesting...

1820
01:31:26,619 --> 01:31:27,880
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: That's true.

1821
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,880
AMY: But is this coming from upstairs? JERRY: It is.

1822
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:34,659
RYAN: Are they... What's that about with the barricade?

1823
01:31:34,659 --> 01:31:36,180
KATE: Just gonna ask them straight up?

1824
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:38,560
RYAN: Yeah. Why is it like that? Did you guys do that?

1825
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:42,740
JERRY: "We don't know what could come through on that side."

1826
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,720
"We know where people come in."

1827
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,000
"But we don't actually understand how any of this works."

1828
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,319
"It's not an inn, I don't think."

1829
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:51,299
RYAN: Hmm. Where have you been sleeping?

1830
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,840
JERRY: "Fresh beds upstairs." RYAN: Hmm.

1831
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,319
RYAN: (whispering) Upstairs' where the knocking is. AMY: We should.... see what's--

1832
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:00,380
KATE: Let's go get Donaar to open a door.

1833
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:02,380
RYAN: (sigh) AMY: When the inn's a knockin'....

1834
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:04,380
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Rockin'...?

1835
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:05,779
AMY: Don't come a....

1836
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,180
AMY: Night folks. KRIS: All right. Roll again.

1837
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:12,920
KRIS: Let's have a advantage. RYAN: You took a look at the wrong camera. That one...

1838
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,960
AMY: That's my left. I like looking at the wrong camera.

1839
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,960
JERRY: No, no. No, that's what it is. It's just ah...

1840
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,500
(laughter)

1841
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,039
AMY: Bye! JERRY: Exactly.

1842
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:23,039
KRIS: I'm repulsed. JERRY: But that's the thing.

1843
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:26,640
JERRY: So as you are starting to move toward the stairs,

1844
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:34,200
you can see the rogue just sort of like cast an eye over...

1845
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,960
over the shoulder just like...

1846
01:32:36,119 --> 01:32:38,939
AMY: Ah. RYAN: I say, hey man. Just going to check out the beds.

1847
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
AMY: I say, what big guy said.

1848
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,439
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: Chill.

1849
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,319
JERRY: It's like-- he's like, "Our rooms are the first three."

1850
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:50,099
"Any room past that is fine."

1851
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:51,960
AMY: Absolutely. KRIS: Sure.

1852
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:54,600
AMY: I make my way up, and I want to...

1853
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,500
Can I listen at the first door?

1854
01:32:56,939 --> 01:32:58,779
KATE: Should we come up so we don't split the party?

1855
01:32:58,779 --> 01:33:00,599
AMY: Oh! I mean... KATE: Yeah.

1856
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,560
KATE: I'm going to lean heavily

1857
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,000
KATE: on my quarterstaff and take the stairs. RYAN: Team Food, we are rolling together.

1858
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,640
KATE: So slowly. RYAN: Team yum yums.

1859
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,493
KRIS: Yeah, I'm already on my way up there because these-- like this is un-life to me.

1860
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:12,560
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

1861
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,340
KRIS: The idea of people who have denied themselves the beyond.

1862
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:19,860
KRIS: This is satisfactory... is just wretched. AMY: The chance for death.

1863
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:22,099
RYAN: These guys volunteered for prison, essentially. KRIS: I have nothing...

1864
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,660
KRIS: I have nothing in common with these people. RYAN: A bed and a meal. That's jail.

1865
01:33:24,659 --> 01:33:26,439
AMY: Yeah, they've taken themselves outside of the cycle of life.

1866
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:29,779
JERRY: So as you-- as your-- So you guys are all going to go upstairs?

1867
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,680
KATE: Yeah all together. RYAN: We just said we were going to take a little nappy.

1868
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,860
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. KRIS: Let's all go up.

1869
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:37,539
JERRY: As soon as your foot hits the first stair...

1870
01:33:37,539 --> 01:33:38,899
AMY: Of course. RYAN: It bites you.

1871
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,279
JERRY: I would like to get a wisdom saves from...

1872
01:33:42,279 --> 01:33:43,039
KRIS: What? AMY: Saves?

1873
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:45,300
JERRY: Rosie, Donaar, and K'thriss

1874
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,300
AMY: Oh. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Okay. KATE: Oh my, okay.

1875
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,160
AMY: Oh no. KRIS: Wis...

1876
01:33:49,159 --> 01:33:50,579
AMY: I'm sorry my little chickadees.

1877
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:53,420
RYAN: So I get a plus two on my saving throw for wisdom? &gt;&gt; AMY: Yes. KRIS: How many do I got left on this bad boy?

1878
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:54,840
KATE: I'm going to use an advantage.

1879
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,159
AMY: Yeah, yeah, you got it. KATE: You want to knock me down one, Jerry.

1880
01:33:57,159 --> 01:33:58,739
KRIS: Knock me down as well. RYAN: 19!

1881
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,620
KATE: Oh yeah, it's not good.

1882
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,220
JERRY: 19 is very good.

1883
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,640
RYAN: I'm smart as shit. KRIS: Ugh. &gt;&gt; KATE: 18?

1884
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,640
KRIS: So it's gonna be a... JERRY: God that's really good too.

1885
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,380
KRIS: (lip smacking) (singing) Ba ba ba bah. What is it wisdom?

1886
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:11,380
JERRY: Wisdom. KRIS: It's gonna be a 12 for me.

1887
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:13,380
JERRY: Ugh. RYAN: I start quoting A Brief History of Time.

1888
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
KRIS: Hmm wise.

1889
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
JERRY: All right. RYAN: E equals MC Stairs.

1890
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,640
RYAN: (fake laughter)

1891
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,640
JERRY: Monster. You're the devil.

1892
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,640
AMY: I get out my bow and I just shoot myself.

1893
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,640
JERRY: (laughing) Exactly.

1894
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,460
It's got to be context appropriate.

1895
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:30,420
I want all the suicide in this game to be legit.

1896
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:31,940
KRIS: Okay, how do I get bitten?

1897
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,760
JERRY: Not yet. KATE: Door bites me.

1898
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,659
KRIS: What bites me?

1899
01:34:35,239 --> 01:34:38,659
JERRY: Not yet. You hear a whisper.

1900
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:43,539
Almost like a person who is reading a book

1901
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:47,660
and just sort of like mouthing along with the words.

1902
01:34:47,659 --> 01:34:50,220
You hear a whisper from the wizard.

1903
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:52,300
KATE: (whispering) Oh no.

1904
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,440
JERRY: You really don't think much of it. There's no reason that they would harm you.

1905
01:34:57,239 --> 01:35:00,380
Like you can't think of any reason. In fact, you feel...

1906
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:04,320
your attitude toward them, generally, is positive.

1907
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:08,300
You can't imagine a scenario in which they would do you harm so you don't...

1908
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,780
pay a lot of attention to that. It's fine.

1909
01:35:10,779 --> 01:35:13,119
KRIS: It's not positive, but it's ambivalent.

1910
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:15,460
JERRY: No, it's positive. You feel good. KRIS: Really?

1911
01:35:15,739 --> 01:35:17,819
KRIS: Feel good inside? Something's wrong. JERRY: You feel good.

1912
01:35:17,819 --> 01:35:20,500
JERRY: You would help them move. Let me put it like that.

1913
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,500
AMY: K'thriss and the brain. JERRY: You would help this wizard move.

1914
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,119
RYAN: Ah great. KRIS: Do they know I feel this way?

1915
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,599
AMY: Without payment. KRIS: Do you guys know?

1916
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,300
JERRY: No.

1917
01:35:27,699 --> 01:35:30,819
KRIS: Oh my god. KATE: Does my... Do I feel the same with my 18?

1918
01:35:30,819 --> 01:35:36,420
JERRY: No. No, no. You're just following Walnut upstairs in this version of the Inn.

1919
01:35:37,539 --> 01:35:39,439
You are behind Walnut.

1920
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:41,500
JERRY: You're heading on your way up. RYAN: Yeah.

1921
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
JERRY: About halfway up the stairs...

1922
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,680
RYAN: Mm-hmm.

1923
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:48,500
JERRY: Walnut, I need a wisdom save from you.

1924
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:51,020
AMY: I bet you do... I bet you do.

1925
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:56,680
AMY: Mmm. Hang on. That's plus five. 12. RYAN: You need some books. Book learning.

1926
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,039
JERRY: That's a shit show. RYAN: Yeah.

1927
01:35:58,039 --> 01:35:59,800
KATE: Yikes. AMY: Well they can't all be 20's.

1928
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,199
KRIS: Hey mine was a 12. JERRY: Exactly.

1929
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,800
KRIS:  I thought it was okay. I like these guys.

1930
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,960
RYAN: (laughs) We should stay here. KRIS: Yeah.

1931
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:11,420
JERRY: Yeah, it is at this point-- So you're right behind Walnut as you're walking up the stairs.

1932
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:13,800
JERRY: You're like not touching the railing. RYAN: Oh no.

1933
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,820
JERRY: You're like tippy toe on the thing.

1934
01:36:15,819 --> 01:36:19,559
It's like in your mind you're sort of psyching yourself up to reach for that door.

1935
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,780
You have like door-- You have PTSD but the D is for door.

1936
01:36:21,779 --> 01:36:24,279
RYAN: I will not touch the door. Yeah. We made that joke last time. I'll make it every time.

1937
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:27,079
JERRY: No, no. Every game it's going to come back.

1938
01:36:27,079 --> 01:36:29,079
RYAN: Post Traumatic Stress "Dis-door-der."

1939
01:36:29,079 --> 01:36:31,079
JERRY: Until it's fucking appreciated. KATE: Yep.

1940
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:36,399
JERRY: So... Here's the situation, so from behind...

1941
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:39,300
from behind Walnut...

1942
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,980
you can see...

1943
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,340
like growing up from the neck

1944
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,640
you see this shimmering...

1945
01:36:48,699 --> 01:36:54,819
razor sharp crown form from the base of her neck.

1946
01:36:55,260 --> 01:37:02,860
All the way up and around until it's like a gleaming diadem.

1947
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:06,179
That must hurt to wear in some way.

1948
01:37:08,819 --> 01:37:10,479
KRIS: That crown... RYAN: I say,

1949
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,380
JERRY: Walnut... RYAN: I don't think that was there...

1950
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,779
JERRY: You turn around...

1951
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:17,440
JERRY: And Donaar is right in front of you...

1952
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,600
and you attack him.

1953
01:37:19,979 --> 01:37:21,639
RYAN: Ugh, great. JERRY: With your scimitar.

1954
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,740
AMY: Awesome. Cool, okay. Let's see. RYAN: (wheezing noises)

1955
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:28,539
KRIS: Dang it, I know what this is. AMY: That's plus five... Nine.

1956
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:29,899
RYAN: Yay.

1957
01:37:31,399 --> 01:37:32,619
JERRY: What's your armor class?

1958
01:37:32,619 --> 01:37:34,619
RYAN: 18. JERRY: Okay, so it's half.

1959
01:37:35,239 --> 01:37:41,739
JERRY: So she turns around. You don't see Walnut in there at all.

1960
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:49,700
And she-- the scimitar comes of the sheath in the same motion that it catches you in the chest.

1961
01:37:49,699 --> 01:37:53,760
But even on the stairs you don't move at all.

1962
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,640
JERRY: You don't move an inch. RYAN: Yeah.

1963
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:58,460
JERRY: It just like connects and nothing happens. RYAN: Big tough boy.

1964
01:37:58,779 --> 01:38:00,779
JERRY: It just stops. All right we need initiative, folks. RYAN: And I'm like...

1965
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:04,380
RYAN: I mean I'm proud for a minute.

1966
01:38:04,859 --> 01:38:06,239
AMY: You're gonna fight your nut.

1967
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:09,059
RYAN: I'm like, hey I just met you. KATE: 12.

1968
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,680
RYAN: (sigh) One. AMY: 20!

1969
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,480
KRIS: Let me give you something.

1970
01:38:11,479 --> 01:38:12,459
RYAN: I go last. JERRY: 20?

1971
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,460
KRIS: What is going on? That's three of them! AMY: That's my third 20 of the game!

1972
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,460
AMY: Mwah! &gt;&gt; KATE: Amazing. JERRY: Dude you're heatin' it up! It's like...

1973
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:19,300
AMY: Blessed! KATE: Don't be excited. You're trying to kill us now.

1974
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:21,300
AMY: Well... RYAN: Yeah.

1975
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,500
AMY: We never introduced ourselves. I'm going to kill-- RYAN: I know, I'm gonna join these guys.

1976
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,380
AMY: you without even knowing your name. RYAN: I'm not joking anymore.

1977
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:28,260
KRIS: I have a 19. RYAN: They haven't attacked me. You have.

1978
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:29,300
KRIS: 19. JERRY: Jeez.

1979
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:31,560
JERRY: All right. KATE: I think they've identified you as their fourth share.

1980
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:32,280
JERRY: Yeah

1981
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:36,380
AMY: Well I'd get the share, that's really all that... KATE: That's true.

1982
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:38,460
KATE: Don't have an emotional connection to us at all.

1983
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:41,139
RYAN: At least we ate... JERRY: Ugh god.

1984
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,660
KATE: At least you ate. Rosie-- AMY: If you're going to murder your friends

1985
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:44,460
AMY: you should do it on a full stomach.

1986
01:38:44,939 --> 01:38:46,979
JERRY: All right... AMY: "Friends?" &gt;&gt; RYAN: Ugh. Friends.

1987
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:49,679
JERRY: Here's the situation, Walnut.

1988
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:54,780
AMY: Yeah. JERRY: So you can, you can move where you want to,

1989
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:58,860
JERRY: but I determine the attacks. AMY: Totally fine.

1990
01:38:59,359 --> 01:39:03,259
JERRY: So I would like you to try to strike him again with your "sci-mi-tar."

1991
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:05,579
AMY: Okay. RYAN: Go away!

1992
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,720
AMY: That is a 23 to hit.

1993
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,840
RYAN: Yeah well, I have an 18. KRIS: Stop with these 20s.

1994
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,199
AMY: So then... JERRY: Okay. Let's get that damage going.

1995
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:17,699
AMY: Okay, so it's a 1d6 plus three slashing so it's a five.

1996
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:19,640
RYAN: So I take 5?

1997
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:23,420
JERRY: Yeah, the first time, it just bounces off and you're like, okay. That's nice.

1998
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:26,840
That's cool. That's therapeutic

1999
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:30,720
And this this next one catches--

2000
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:34,960
This next one actually catches under a plate and digs in a bit.

2001
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:37,239
KRIS: It's a team-building exercise.

2002
01:39:37,239 --> 01:39:38,219
RYAN: Yeah really. JERRY: Yeah, exactly

2003
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,740
RYAN: Is this a weird D&amp;D version of a trust fall?

2004
01:39:40,739 --> 01:39:42,000
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b!

2005
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,760
KRIS: What yeah, what's my-- RYAN: I say, dude!

2006
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:48,260
KRIS: What's my state? Describe to me again. I'm now witnessing...

2007
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:52,140
What's the lineup, who's in front of me? I'm witnessing this--

2008
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:56,000
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. So you are at the back. KRIS: Yeah.

2009
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,279
JERRY: Then Rosie, then Donaar Blit'zen, and then Walnut at the top of the stairs.

2010
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:02,179
KRIS: Who spun around.

2011
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:06,140
JERRY: Who has spun around and is now attacking Donaar.

2012
01:40:10,279 --> 01:40:12,519
KRIS: Momma mia... It's not great.

2013
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:13,780
KATE: You're drunk. KRIS: I don't like the feeling.

2014
01:40:13,779 --> 01:40:15,059
KRIS: Am I still drunk? Is that still happening?

2015
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:17,560
Ah I drank when I got here.

2016
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,060
(laughter)

2017
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,380
KRIS: It wore off so I...

2018
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:25,840
Yeah what's going on behind us? What are these three clowns doing?

2019
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:29,199
JERRY: Right now they are just watching the events.

2020
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:34,800
Like they're watching it like you would, like a normal person would watch television.

2021
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:37,440
KATE: (whispering) They're feeding us to this inn.

2022
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:44,200
KRIS: Where does the combat and roleplay intersect? Because I want to speak to these creeps.

2023
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:46,199
JERRY: You can. You can do whatever you want. KATE: At the corner of Dungeon and Dragon.

2024
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:47,559
RYAN: Yeah, thanks for the help!

2025
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,560
JERRY: (laughing) Yeah, at the corner of Dungeon and Dragon?

2026
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,940
JERRY: That's the new name of the show! No we're taking a-- No more "C" Team!

2027
01:40:51,939 --> 01:40:53,960
KRIS: Get rid of the rest of it. Yes. JERRY: Hi!

2028
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:57,640
RYAN: Can you magically bind her so I stop being attacked? How about that?

2029
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,500
KRIS: I might not have any of that. JERRY: You can do whatever you like.

2030
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,579
RYAN: I want to spit acid in Walnut's face.

2031
01:41:01,579 --> 01:41:03,500
JERRY: If you want to say a quick phrase or something like that, like--

2032
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,720
RYAN: You're too close. You're way too close. JERRY: Again, if something is sufficiently...

2033
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,659
JERRY: If something is rad then I'm okay with it.

2034
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
KATE: Do a rad thing. &gt;&gt; AMY: It's the rad rule. KRIS: Oh boy.

2035
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,680
KRIA: No, I've got nothing rad yet. KATE: Be a rad roach. &gt;&gt; AMY: Rad roach!

2036
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:17,100
KRIS: You gotta give me-- (laughing) You gotta give me more time than that!

2037
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,720
KRIS: No, I attack you too. RYAN: Oh great.

2038
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,740
(laughter)

2039
01:41:21,739 --> 01:41:25,159
JERRY: I annihilate Donaar. KRIS: To show fealty to our new king.

2040
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:27,760
AMY: Tag-teaming this dragonborn. RYAN: I call for the cat.

2041
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,760
KATE: It's her diadem. RYAN: Onyx help.

2042
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,760
KATE: I think that's the secret.

2043
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,960
KRIS: I will... I'm going to... I'm going to... KATE: (in a high pitched voice) Attack the diadem!

2044
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,359
KRIS: Oh boy. Hold on a second, RYAN: The what? &gt;&gt; KATE: Diadem.

2045
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:39,659
KRIS: I'm going to-- I want to cast hex on you. AMY: Fight me, drow.

2046
01:41:39,659 --> 01:41:41,659
KRIS: Because I want to-- I want to drop your...

2047
01:41:41,659 --> 01:41:43,519
RYAN: Knock the crown off her head, yo.

2048
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,060
AMY: I like my crown.

2049
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,060
KRIS: Hang on, hang on, you all.

2050
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:49,420
Uh... Hex!

2051
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:53,060
KATE: I like your-- You're like, I like it! You got bougie real fast.

2052
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:57,060
KRIS: Right, so the way Hex works is... RYAN: Raindrop.

2053
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:59,500
AMY: Tell me. KRIS: You take extra damage when I attack you.

2054
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:02,140
KRIS: But nobody else. AMY: Hmm oh so it's like your Hunter's Mark?

2055
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,820
KRIS: Right. JERRY: Yeah, but spooky.

2056
01:42:04,819 --> 01:42:06,539
AMY: But spookier. KRIS: But scarier.

2057
01:42:06,539 --> 01:42:12,039
KRIS: But you also take a disadvantage to an ability check that I choose.

2058
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:15,020
AMY: Take a guess which one you think would be good.

2059
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,020
KRIS: What is your dex? Use that?

2060
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:20,360
But the thing is, is that that doesn't define this stuff...

2061
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:24,119
I want to make it easier-- I want to make it more difficult for you to cause harm.

2062
01:42:24,119 --> 01:42:26,119
AMY: Okay, what are you doing? KRIS: I don't think I can pull you out.

2063
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:27,439
AMY: What do you think that might be?

2064
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:29,439
RYAN: Just take the thing off her head!

2065
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:30,979
KRIS: That's not... AMY: This is his way.

2066
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:32,479
RYAN: All right. Okay. AMY: That's your way.

2067
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:34,779
KRIS: That's my way. You knock it off! You're right next to her.

2068
01:42:34,779 --> 01:42:36,340
RYAN: Oh I'm gonna. AMY: You're a giant. You're a giant man.

2069
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:40,000
RYAN: I got a big, wide acid spray. Might hit the crown, might not.

2070
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
That's what we'll all find out in--

2071
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,680
RYAN: in a few short turns. AMY: My beautiful girl.

2072
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:48,920
KRIS: What does she need-- Does she sa... What does she need to save out of this? Or can she?

2073
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,199
JERRY: She needs... KRIS: I'm assuming.

2074
01:42:50,199 --> 01:42:51,739
JERRY: Yeah this is probably--

2075
01:42:51,739 --> 01:42:55,000
JERRY: This sort of thing is usually a wisdom save. KRIS: A wisdom, okay.

2076
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
KRIS: I want to...

2077
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
You're all... are you Charisma?

2078
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:01,000
KRIS: You are, aren't you? I can see it. KATE: You can't ask her.

2079
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,779
KATE: You can't ask her. NO. KRIS: I can't ask her?

2080
01:43:02,859 --> 01:43:05,380
KRIS: I can go online right now... AMY: Slash, slash, slash.

2081
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:07,380
KATE: Let's look at the Twitch feed...

2082
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:09,380
AMY: Let's look at the Twitch chat. RYAN: I'm bleeding. Like, little faster!

2083
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:11,119
RYAN: Slice, slice. KRIS: Okay, I'm going to do--

2084
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:13,380
RYAN: Kris is over here consulting his books. Hmm. KRIS: I'm going to take away your dex.

2085
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:15,800
KRIS: I'm going to give you a detriment to these dexes.

2086
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,800
KATE: Dexes. Good one, yeah.

2087
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,460
KRIS: That's my idea.

2088
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:21,720
I'm going to do-- let me do another advantage.

2089
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:24,699
Wait let me make sure I got to actually cast it.

2090
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,359
KRIS: Oh it's a bonus action. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

2091
01:43:26,359 --> 01:43:28,359
KRIS: Yeah, okay here we go.

2092
01:43:28,359 --> 01:43:30,939
KRIS: (silly thinking noises)

2093
01:43:31,239 --> 01:43:33,920
Nope. Don't want that. We don't like that.

2094
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:36,340
KRIS: That's better, I like that a lot better. KATE: Ooh yeah.

2095
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,600
AMY: What you got? KRIS: That's an 18.

2096
01:43:39,739 --> 01:43:42,639
AMY: Okay. KRIS: You can tell me if that hit or not.

2097
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,200
KRIS: Did I Hex you? AMY: Yeah, oh yeah.

2098
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:45,239
KRIS: Did you feel that Hex? JERRY: Okay.

2099
01:43:45,239 --> 01:43:47,000
AMY: Ugh. I'm vexed by your Hex.

2100
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,239
RYAN: You done been Hexed. KATE: Nice.

2101
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:53,020
JERRY: Okay so basically she takes more damage from you.

2102
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:55,819
And her dex is in the bone zone?

2103
01:43:55,819 --> 01:43:57,099
KRIS: Yeah JERRY: Okay

2104
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:00,120
KRIS: You take disadvantage on dex. JERRY: All right, now that was your bonus action

2105
01:44:00,119 --> 01:44:01,439
JERRY: what are you going to do with your regular action?

2106
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:05,259
KRIS: Now I'm going to Dissonant Whisper the shit out of you-- No I'm not going to do that.

2107
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:06,960
RYAN: Wait you can move. You didn't move.

2108
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:07,699
KRIS: No I didn't move yet.

2109
01:44:07,699 --> 01:44:09,319
RYAN: No, you didn't move. AMY: That's fine.

2110
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,579
RYAN: Move away from me. (laughs) AMY: No.

2111
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:15,739
KRIS: (sigh) This is really difficult.

2112
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:18,559
KATE: You can do it. JERRY: Yeah, so what are you gonna do?

2113
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,280
JERRY: I mean you have this situation down here.

2114
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,880
You have this situation up here on the stairs.

2115
01:44:23,979 --> 01:44:26,559
It's a double situation, situation.

2116
01:44:27,279 --> 01:44:28,479
KATE: (clapping)

2117
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,840
KRIS: Oh my god, I don't want to open that door! RYAN: It's called the fisherman's gambit.

2118
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:31,760
AMY: It's the razor's edge.

2119
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,840
JERRY: This is the fucking razor's edge. RYAN: Yeah.

2120
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:36,399
KRIS: This is the danger zone. RYAN: Yeah.

2121
01:44:36,399 --> 01:44:37,879
JERRY: Or the highway to it.

2122
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:40,399
KATE: Dungeon this dragon, son.

2123
01:44:40,699 --> 01:44:45,079
AMY: How long can he stall? KRIS: What would K'thriss do? WWKD?

2124
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:47,380
KRIS: Besides hold the game up.

2125
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:50,980
RYAN: Three weeks later... Yeah. (laughs) AMY: We're all dead.

2126
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:54,140
KRIS: Umm...

2127
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,560
RYAN: I go get another plate of food. I get a plate of food while I wait.

2128
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,940
JERRY: Well here let me see, we have...

2129
01:44:58,939 --> 01:45:00,859
KRIS: Let me speak to these guys, it's all I can do. JERRY: We have this barricade...

2130
01:45:00,859 --> 01:45:02,500
JERRY: We have this here. KATE: Talk-- You want to talk to--

2131
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,479
JERRY: We have that. KRIS: I want to talk to them.

2132
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:04,639
KATE: to the dude bros? Okay. JERRY: Yeah, go ahead.

2133
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:08,100
KRIS: Is this your doing?

2134
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:09,900
JERRY: "Which?"

2135
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,280
KRIS: The crown! And the attack!

2136
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:15,279
JERRY: The wizard giggles.

2137
01:45:17,859 --> 01:45:19,559
RYAN: Guys, not cool. KRIS: Vampyr!

2138
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:22,760
JERRY: But here's the terrible part, is that...

2139
01:45:23,739 --> 01:45:25,399
you giggle a little bit too.

2140
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:27,399
RYAN: (whispering) Oh god... KATE: (whispering) Oh no you like it?

2141
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:31,300
KRIS: Well I know what it is. JERRY: Well you understand why they would do it.

2142
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,560
KRIS: Oh yeah. JERRY: Right?

2143
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,020
KRIS: I can tell. JERRY: Yeah.

2144
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,600
JERRY: It makes perfect sense.

2145
01:45:36,739 --> 01:45:38,079
And it is a little funny.

2146
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:41,479
RYAN: It is a little funny. KATE: I fail to find humor.

2147
01:45:41,479 --> 01:45:43,479
KRIS: Has that been my action? RYAN: I'm stabbed and I'm like, this is kind of funny.

2148
01:45:43,979 --> 01:45:46,119
JERRY: If you have another thing you'd want to say...

2149
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,420
Since you didn't use your action proper, if you want to have some other juice, go for it.

2150
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,560
KRIS: All right, let me give it a shot. I'm going to do a--

2151
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,700
I'm going to in a jestful way-- Vicious Mockery.

2152
01:45:56,699 --> 01:45:57,840
JERRY: To who?

2153
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,300
KRIS: To the wizard.

2154
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,440
JERRY: You cannot. KRIS: I cannot?

2155
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,820
JERRY: You can't. You wouldn't.

2156
01:46:04,899 --> 01:46:07,779
KRIS: Not even in a joshing sort of a "you-so-and-so?"

2157
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:10,079
JERRY:  No, but these other people, maybe.

2158
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:11,659
KRIS: Oh okay. RYAN: Hit that rogue.

2159
01:46:12,279 --> 01:46:13,739
KRIS: Now that I'm aware of that...

2160
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:17,119
Yeah, let me pop the leather wearer.

2161
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:20,460
RYAN: Or open that door. Someone's knocking. They're probably here to help.

2162
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,460
We've had a lot of success with doors.

2163
01:46:22,539 --> 01:46:23,840
KRIS: I'm going to... RYAN: I'll open the door!

2164
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,319
KRIS: I'm going to hang back on that one.

2165
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:27,399
JERRY: Go for it. KRIS: Yeah, let's do Vicious Mockery.

2166
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:34,060
KRIS: Ooh! That's going to be a 22. KATE: What's Vicious Mockery do?

2167
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:34,920
KRIS: Wait a minute.

2168
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,960
KATE: To what? Can you just cast it? It's just a cantrip right?

2169
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,260
KRIS: I think I can just say it.

2170
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,060
JERRY: No, no, no, Vicious Mockery you don't have to roll to attack.

2171
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,660
KRIS: That's right. They have to save against it. KATE: Right.

2172
01:46:41,659 --> 01:46:42,260
JERRY: Mm-hmm.

2173
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:46,239
KATE: You just want to roll those dice. KRIS: I have these cards here that I haven't used.

2174
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:49,279
KRIS: (whispering) Because I didn't-- JERRY: I do save against it.

2175
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:51,460
KATE: Uh oh. KRIS: Okay, damn.

2176
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:53,239
KATE: All right. KRIS: All right. Then I just relax.

2177
01:46:53,239 --> 01:46:56,500
AMY: Vicious Mockery I always just think of as like Cyberbullying, the spell.

2178
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,739
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: I wrote you a really bad review.

2179
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:01,279
AMY: I leave bad comments on your video. Yes. JERRY: It's the magical version.

2180
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:02,699
JERRY: All right.

2181
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,260
KATE: Is it Rosie's turn?

2182
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:08,060
JERRY: It is almost Rosie's turn.

2183
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:09,340
AMY: Nope. KATE: (groans)

2184
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,460
AMY: It looks like you've got a little vampyr face before Rosie.

2185
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,460
RYAN: I got this knife in me. KATE: Oh vampyr?

2186
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:16,220
RYAN: And I'm just... AMY: It's a good looking scimitar.

2187
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:20,980
JERRY: So the three of them stand up from the table.

2188
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:24,460
And say...

2189
01:47:25,399 --> 01:47:26,960
the rogue says,

2190
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:30,760
"We have a really good thing going here."

2191
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:34,180
"And we don't know what happens if someone leaves."

2192
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,380
"So you can't leave."

2193
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,239
AMY/KATE: Hmm.

2194
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:42,199
JERRY: "You can make your peace with it..."

2195
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:45,339
"or we can figure you out."

2196
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:48,640
"Just like we figured out the other groups that came through here."

2197
01:47:49,979 --> 01:47:52,839
KATE: I crack my knuckles... menacingly. (knuckles cracking)

2198
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:55,739
KRIS: There's so many. KATE: So many knuckles.

2199
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:57,920
JERRY: New knuckles come out.

2200
01:47:59,079 --> 01:48:03,019
AMY: Just everything cracks. JERRY: So they're waiting. They are not attacking yet.

2201
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:06,360
JERRY: Now it's Rosie Beestinger's turn. KATE: Rosie Beestinger...

2202
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:09,199
KATE: I cast Silence on that wizard!

2203
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:11,439
JERRY: Ooh. KATE: Shut up!

2204
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:14,399
KRIS: (whispering) Oh yeah. AMY: You kids quiet down!

2205
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:17,000
(laughter)

2206
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,760
KATE: Do you know what time it is? It's late! AMY: You're making a racket.

2207
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,500
JERRY: Awesome. Okay.

2208
01:48:24,579 --> 01:48:26,899
So the middle of the middle of the--

2209
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,420
there's no more creaking of chairs, tables--

2210
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:32,760
the middle goes out and you can see their mouths furiously moving.

2211
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:42,640
As soon as you notice-- as soon as they notice the silence they move immediately into a very sophisticated

2212
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:47,560
set of gestures that are not, I mean it's like...

2213
01:48:49,619 --> 01:48:54,680
It's robust. It's not-- it isn't like, hey let's do this.

2214
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:57,659
They are communicating ideas with it.

2215
01:48:58,119 --> 01:49:00,439
Um, next up we have Donaar.

2216
01:49:00,979 --> 01:49:02,539
RYAN: Ah...

2217
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,860
AMY: (grunts) RYAN: Hmm well, I got to...

2218
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:09,259
AMY: (grunts) (laughs)

2219
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:13,060
RYAN: All right we've got a couple things going on, I'm getting stabbed.

2220
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:15,280
JERRY: Repeatedly. RYAN: By crazy-pants.

2221
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:18,100
RYAN: There's a knocking upstairs.

2222
01:49:18,939 --> 01:49:20,939
Invariably will be helpful.

2223
01:49:20,939 --> 01:49:23,679
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: And then three...

2224
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:25,600
KATE: Very quiet.

2225
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,600
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah RYAN: Yeah, very quiet.

2226
01:49:28,119 --> 01:49:29,539
RYAN: Umm... JERRY: Yeah.

2227
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:32,200
JERRY: It's your choice. It's your choice. RYAN: And you got the crown on your head.

2228
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:35,000
JERRY: Welcome to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. RYAN: And it's like... yeah...

2229
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,539
KATE: Get that crown. RYAN: I want to get her off me.

2230
01:49:37,539 --> 01:49:39,619
RYAN: I'm going to... KATE: Yeah, smack that crown around.

2231
01:49:39,619 --> 01:49:41,300
KATE: Can you barf acid on her crown?

2232
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,300
RYAN: I--I was-- JERRY: Just on the crown? No.

2233
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:46,360
JERRY: It's not. It isn't that-- It's not like a lathe. RYAN: It's not precision.

2234
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:50,139
JERRY: (laughing) It isn't just like... right here.  KATE: I cast Acid Lathe!

2235
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,340
JERRY: Yeah.

2236
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:54,140
KATE: You can do it! AMY: Just put me out of my misery at that point.

2237
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:56,600
KATE: You can do it! RYAN: I kind of want to throw Amy at them.

2238
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:59,480
AMY: Walnut. RYAN: Or Walnut. I want to throw her at them.

2239
01:49:59,479 --> 01:50:02,279
RYAN: To disrupt their little dance. KATE (whispering) Can you do it? Please?

2240
01:50:02,279 --> 01:50:03,359
JERRY: Yeah, you can. KATE: (whispering) Yes!

2241
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:04,279
KRIS: Oh yeah

2242
01:50:04,279 --> 01:50:05,239
KATE: Yeah, do it! RYAN: So...

2243
01:50:05,239 --> 01:50:06,719
KRIS: And she's gonna suffer on that dex...

2244
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,420
KRIS: so she's going to land hard. AMY: I have so many HP!

2245
01:50:08,659 --> 01:50:10,639
AMY: It's fine! I don't want you to see. Go ahead.

2246
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:12,340
RYAN: You shouldn't have done that! AMY: You said you were going to do it.

2247
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:15,180
RYAN: I can't like, make a swipe at the crown first, can I?

2248
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:17,180
RYAN: That's two actions, right? JERRY: No no, just give me... you can just give me--

2249
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:19,180
JERRY: If you want to throw her or get her out of here...

2250
01:50:19,819 --> 01:50:21,279
RYAN: Well, I do, but...

2251
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:23,619
KATE: Like a bowling ball.

2252
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:26,220
RYAN: Onto the table, onto the table to-- KATE: Knock down those pins!

2253
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:27,980
RYAN: just disrupt their little dance. JERRY: Yeah, it's...

2254
01:50:27,979 --> 01:50:29,979
JERRY: it's shimmering and lightly translucent.

2255
01:50:29,979 --> 01:50:31,879
RYAN: Okay. So this will-- JERRY: Like it's-- you know what I mean, like you're not--

2256
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,880
RYAN: And this will knock-- JERRY: It seems like some magic bullshit.

2257
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,560
RYAN/KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: Which I hate. I fucking hate this place!

2258
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,260
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: All right.

2259
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,400
KATE: She's bendy and you have mending so you can heal her.

2260
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:42,420
KRIS: I'll fix her, whatever, it's great. RYAN: So what do I got to-- what do I just roll strength?

2261
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:44,640
JERRY: Yeah, I was gonna say, this is going to be a strength...

2262
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:46,640
KRIS: It's going to be a caber toss. RYAN: Athletics?

2263
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:51,599
JERRY: Yeah, this is-- Yeah I would say druid throwing is a sport where you're from.

2264
01:50:52,699 --> 01:50:55,619
RYAN: So when I'm doing this, I have a strength bonus and an athletic bonus,

2265
01:50:55,619 --> 01:50:57,279
I don't do them-- I take the bigger one right?

2266
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,779
JERRY: You get-- it's a combo pack.

2267
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:02,639
RYAN: Oh, so it's eight? Plus eight? JERRY: Yeah.

2268
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:05,560
JERRY: No, no this is-- You are good at this. This is... RYAN: Cool.

2269
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,340
RYAN: I got two advantages.

2270
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:09,600
RYAN: How bad do I want to whip Amy over there? KATE: You do. You want it real bad.

2271
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,280
AMY: Walnut. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah, Walnut. KATE: You want it real bad.

2272
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:13,039
RYAN: How bad to I want to whip Walnut over there? KATE: Yeah, real bad.

2273
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:16,699
RYAN: I'm going to chuck Pinecone across this room. KRIS: Put your back into it. &gt;&gt; KATE: Yes, yeah.

2274
01:51:16,779 --> 01:51:17,880
JERRY: You want to try it?

2275
01:51:18,659 --> 01:51:20,000
RYAN: 19. JERRY: 19.

2276
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,779
RYAN: Oh wait plus eight.

2277
01:51:21,779 --> 01:51:25,019
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KATE: I think you chuck her. You chuck that nut!

2278
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:30,300
JERRY: She's a little cagey. She's come at you once already, twice already.

2279
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:35,039
And then, she goes in for another like overhand chop,

2280
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:37,180
and you just catch her underneath the arm.

2281
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:39,560
Just one motion. Just like whoop!

2282
01:51:39,979 --> 01:51:41,459
Like that, just one smooth motion.

2283
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,239
Scimitars up in the air.

2284
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,900
Right over the railing, down on the edge.

2285
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:49,359
That's four points of damage for you.

2286
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,100
RYAN: (whispering) Sorry.

2287
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,500
AMY: (angry noise) Frothing. RYAN: I took five!

2288
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,380
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Right on the table.

2289
01:51:58,819 --> 01:52:01,420
So food, stew...

2290
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,020
It's very Game of Thrones, I could go into it for ten minutes.

2291
01:52:05,739 --> 01:52:07,859
JERRY: Just every-- AMY: It's pornographic--

2292
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:10,940
KRIS: But you eat some of it as you land and you get that four right back.

2293
01:52:10,939 --> 01:52:13,379
JERRY: And you regain health. KRIS: Immediately.

2294
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:14,980
JERRY: Absolutely. RYAN: Gravy.

2295
01:52:14,979 --> 01:52:17,399
JERRY: So you've tossed her down and then this...

2296
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:19,319
(tapping on table)

2297
01:52:19,319 --> 01:52:22,659
JERRY: The pounding is less rhythmic. AMY: Nice.

2298
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:25,940
JERRY: It is now more insistent. KRIS: Hee hee. That's why I'm giggling.

2299
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:29,140
KATE: You love it. Love that pounding. (laughs) KRIS: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

2300
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:31,500
RYAN: Oh man. You're going to be a problem too.

2301
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,399
Uh... All right.

2302
01:52:33,399 --> 01:52:35,379
JERRY: It's like this is some other bullshit you have to deal with.

2303
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:37,300
JERRY: This is Donaar in a nutshell. RYAN: Goddamn it yeah.

2304
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:41,760
RYAN: I know, it really is. Like, I hate the shit out of this place. I did from the word go!

2305
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,500
KRIS: It's all we've done. RYAN: And it's only getting worse!

2306
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,680
RYAN: And now there's more of you than ever.

2307
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:49,460
All of you non-dragons; therefore, not as great.

2308
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:51,960
JERRY: Less good. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's a problem. RYAN: Variations of just...

2309
01:52:52,619 --> 01:52:54,680
RYAN: hairy, pink little monsters.

2310
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:59,140
All right. Wait and I get a move now too, right? JERRY: Mm-hmm, yeah.

2311
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,659
JERRY: So you-- RYAN: Where are you in relation to me?

2312
01:53:01,659 --> 01:53:03,159
JERRY: Right behind you. Yeah. KATE: I'm at the base of the stairs.

2313
01:53:03,159 --> 01:53:05,500
RYAN: Okay, we're all at the base of the stairs right? KRIS: Behind you, yeah. We haven't gone up yet, yeah.

2314
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,720
KATE: Except Walnut. KRIS: We may want to dart up there.

2315
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,260
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. So there's-- AMY: Dead friend.

2316
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:10,279
JERRY: Whomp whomp upstairs.

2317
01:53:10,279 --> 01:53:12,279
JERRY: This crew down here. RYAN: Hmm.

2318
01:53:12,279 --> 01:53:14,619
JERRY: She's also down here on the table.

2319
01:53:14,619 --> 01:53:15,699
AMY: Hmm. RYAN: Right.

2320
01:53:16,279 --> 01:53:19,519
RYAN: Should I go up the stairs? I'll go up the stairs. I'm going to go up to the top of the stairs.

2321
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,840
I'm not gonna mess with any doors or anything. I'm just going to go to the top of the stairs.

2322
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:24,260
And I'm gonna say, you guys just want to be in prison?

2323
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:26,100
Is that it? You just are happier in prison?

2324
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,160
I say this as I run.

2325
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,079
This is stupid, you guys are dumb.

2326
01:53:29,079 --> 01:53:31,180
JERRY: It's weird. KRIS: I've seen the cage! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah.

2327
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:36,980
JERRY: It's weird but that sound is coming from the second door, and it appears to be the door itself.

2328
01:53:36,979 --> 01:53:38,099
RYAN: Oh good.

2329
01:53:38,579 --> 01:53:41,640
JERRY: Pounding-- The door itself is undulating...

2330
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:43,619
JERRY: Sensually.... No. KRIS: Ooh.

2331
01:53:43,619 --> 01:53:44,880
RYAN: (laughs) Nice.

2332
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,819
KRIS: It beckons. AMY: Yeah!

2333
01:53:46,819 --> 01:53:48,380
JERRY: That's not what's happening. KRIS: An ancient art.

2334
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:49,180
(laughter)

2335
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:50,800
KATE: Is there a Mr. Door?

2336
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,239
(laughter) RYAN: So... yeah.

2337
01:53:53,579 --> 01:53:55,819
AMY: What's a pretty young door like you doing in an inn like this?

2338
01:53:55,819 --> 01:53:57,219
JERRY: Yeah doing in an inn like this.

2339
01:53:57,859 --> 01:54:01,059
JERRY: We are back up at the top with Walnut.

2340
01:54:01,659 --> 01:54:05,340
So Walnut, now that you are down here by the table,

2341
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:06,219
AMY: Yeah.

2342
01:54:06,699 --> 01:54:09,000
JERRY: you can no longer attack Donaar Blit'zen.

2343
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,079
AMY: Sure. RYAN: Phew!

2344
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:13,000
AMY: I'm not in control of my own faculties anyway. JERRY: But Kris...

2345
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:19,940
JERRY: But K'thriss Drow'b is near enough for you to get a good swipe at.

2346
01:54:19,939 --> 01:54:22,839
So why don't you give him a swipe with the scimitar. AMY: Sure.

2347
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,600
KRIS: Go ahead. Give it a shot!

2348
01:54:25,659 --> 01:54:28,519
AMY: That is a 14.

2349
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,100
JERRY: That's, that should be good. KRIS: Yeah.

2350
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:32,860
AMY: Oh no that's a six! RYAN: I was gonna say...

2351
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,760
RYAN: It's a six but don't you get a Dex penalty?

2352
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,980
AMY: But it's not... RYAN: Does that effect this?

2353
01:54:36,979 --> 01:54:38,679
JERRY: No, no, no. AMY: No, it's just plus five.

2354
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,680
RYAN: Oh plus 5 on your scimitar. AMY: So, that's actually only a...

2355
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:42,680
AMY: that number.... 11.

2356
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:45,280
JERRY: Oh! No, that's insufficient.

2357
01:54:45,279 --> 01:54:48,579
KRIS: I catch the scimitar blade in my teeth. JERRY: Yeah. (growls)

2358
01:54:48,899 --> 01:54:50,899
AMY: What would that be if I did a one maybe.

2359
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:53,860
JERRY: No exactly, just like-- you're looking at her,

2360
01:54:53,859 --> 01:54:57,019
JERRY: just a quick move to the left. RYAN: I'm glad you're rolling poorly.

2361
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:00,420
RYAN: What if these were twenties? JERRY: Is all it took. Right? It's all it took.

2362
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:01,920
JERRY: The twenties are coming in at the right spot.

2363
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,659
JERRY: I need you to give me a wisdom save please. AMY: Sure.

2364
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:06,420
RYAN: And she has a movement too, right?

2365
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,079
AMY: I do, you haven't been giving me those movements.

2366
01:55:09,319 --> 01:55:13,239
Oh! Wow! Seven! (sigh)

2367
01:55:13,899 --> 01:55:16,939
AMY: Eight. JERRY: Your mind is still clouded but you can move.

2368
01:55:16,939 --> 01:55:24,899
AMY: Cool. I... I guess somehow find the strength within me to move as far away from K'thriss as possible.

2369
01:55:24,899 --> 01:55:26,460
KRIS: Go behind these guys.

2370
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,119
RYAN: Run over to the door and start moving-- AMY: Where are the other people?

2371
01:55:29,739 --> 01:55:31,519
JERRY: So they are... AMY: Just lay them out like...

2372
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,600
JERRY: They're basically right behind you.

2373
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:38,480
So whatever this crown is, and you can sort of see it out the edge of your peripheral vision,

2374
01:55:38,479 --> 01:55:43,019
whatever it is it's making you attack people but it doesn't control where you move.

2375
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,820
AMY: Okay.

2376
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:51,460
JERRY: So right now you are sort of interposed between K'thriss and this other party.

2377
01:55:51,739 --> 01:55:53,179
And now you have the ability to move.

2378
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:56,579
AMY: Well I want to move towards the other party.

2379
01:55:56,579 --> 01:55:58,180
Absolutely. 100%.

2380
01:55:58,180 --> 01:55:59,380
JERRY: So you just turn around--

2381
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:01,600
JERRY: and prepare yourself for the next-- AMY: Oh yeah, just like...

2382
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:04,700
AMY: like I'm hollow but there's like a tear.

2383
01:56:04,699 --> 01:56:08,079
JERRY: Yeah, there's just the one black tear. AMY: Yeah

2384
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:09,319
KRIS: Question. JERRY: Just coming down. Yeah.

2385
01:56:09,319 --> 01:56:12,179
KRIS: Okay, it's not an attack but as your movement

2386
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:15,980
can you walk past them and hold your sword out at an angle...

2387
01:56:15,979 --> 01:56:18,439
and just sort of clothesline them. It's not an attack!

2388
01:56:18,439 --> 01:56:21,599
KATE: It's not technically an attack. AMY: It's like stealth keying a car.

2389
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,740
(laughter) JERRY: You can decapitate three of them.

2390
01:56:24,739 --> 01:56:27,239
AMY: Can I key the party? KATE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; JERRY: Exactly.

2391
01:56:27,399 --> 01:56:28,339
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b.

2392
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:31,199
So basically, you're just going to turn around and get ready for the next round.

2393
01:56:31,479 --> 01:56:32,079
AMY: Yeah.

2394
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:33,979
JERRY: Okay. AMY: Are they closer or farther away?

2395
01:56:33,979 --> 01:56:36,919
AMY: Are they close to like the entrance to the basement at all?

2396
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:40,960
JERRY: No, no. They are-- so imagine they're sort of in the center of this common room--

2397
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:43,119
AMY: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Okay I'll go to them. JERRY: And then they are, you know,

2398
01:56:43,119 --> 01:56:45,739
JERRY: it's all about maybe 15 feet from this door barricade.

2399
01:56:45,739 --> 01:56:47,399
AMY: Gotcha, gotcha. JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b.

2400
01:56:47,399 --> 01:56:49,420
KRIS: (whispering) Oh no, monstrous.

2401
01:56:49,619 --> 01:56:53,739
I am... I... Am I able to attack this wizard?

2402
01:56:53,739 --> 01:56:55,639
KRIS: This giggler. JERRY: You wouldn't.

2403
01:56:56,199 --> 01:56:58,300
KRIS: Oh I wouldn't because I'm feeling pretty good about them.

2404
01:56:58,340 --> 01:57:00,239
JERRY: Yeah, yeah yeah. But there are other people here.

2405
01:57:01,319 --> 01:57:03,319
KRIS: (laughs) RYAN: Amy. I mean Walnut.

2406
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:06,199
KRIS: Oh yeah! That's a good idea. No... RYAN: Yeah.

2407
01:57:06,439 --> 01:57:07,500
RYAN: She took a swing at you.

2408
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:11,380
KRIS: I go back to that-- I go back to the rogue.

2409
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:14,180
JERRY: Mm-hmm. KRIS: And this time I'm going to do Dissonant Whispers.

2410
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:15,699
AMY: Finally. RYAN: Yeah.

2411
01:57:15,699 --> 01:57:16,939
KRIS: Dissonant Vespers (Amy whispering indistinctly)

2412
01:57:16,939 --> 01:57:19,699
RYAN: Fan favorite. KRIS: Again! Another one I don't have the card for.

2413
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,979
KRIS: So let me pop it in there,

2414
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:24,220
because it too, is not a...

2415
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:26,780
KRIS: if I remember correctly... JERRY: Mm-hmm.

2416
01:57:26,779 --> 01:57:29,579
KRIS: Yeah, you have to save wisdom against it.

2417
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:31,000
So the question is do you?

2418
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:33,039
JERRY: All right. Uh...

2419
01:57:33,899 --> 01:57:34,639
Ugh.

2420
01:57:34,939 --> 01:57:36,339
Nope, that's the filth zone.

2421
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:38,100
KRIS: All right! JERRY: What happens next?

2422
01:57:39,239 --> 01:57:42,219
KRIS: You have got to take 3d6 psychic.

2423
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:43,380
JERRY/KATE: Ugh. AMY: Get them.

2424
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:44,699
KRIS: And enjoy that.

2425
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:50,800
So that's gonna be... nine... Woo! That's 14!

2426
01:57:51,119 --> 01:57:55,000
KATE/AMY: Schnitzels. KRIS: Enjoy 14-- 14 psychic damage!

2427
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,199
JERRY: Good Lord!

2428
01:57:56,439 --> 01:57:59,899
KRIS: And you have to take your reaction to get away from me.

2429
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,560
Because I made you feel very bad.

2430
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,220
JERRY: Oh okay. AMY: Go think about what you did.

2431
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:06,100
JERRY: Yeah, it... KRIS: It...

2432
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:07,700
JERRY: Yeah I was going to say it...

2433
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:14,380
runs at like-- like scramble--

2434
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:20,000
JERRY: All of its dexterity is in play here going over-- KRIS: (making scared sound effects)

2435
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:27,979
JERRY: Yeah, like a spider. Just over tables and chairs, and then it just slides over the back edge of the bar.

2436
01:58:27,979 --> 01:58:28,839
KRIS: Right.

2437
01:58:29,779 --> 01:58:31,779
KRIS: Like a Western. JERRY: Mm-hmm.

2438
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:36,660
KATE: You're calling it an "it," where prevously it was a "she." Is it now an "it?"

2439
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:38,720
JERRY: I messed up. KATE: Hmm...

2440
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:39,860
JERRY: "She". I was like hmm... KATE: Okay. Okay, okay, okay!

2441
01:58:39,859 --> 01:58:41,119
KATE: Just checking. I was like, are we fighting--

2442
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:43,399
KATE: some kind of spider-monster now? JERRY: No. Is it a changeling? No, no, no.

2443
01:58:43,399 --> 01:58:44,599
KATE: It's Dungeons &amp; Dragons, motherfucker.

2444
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:47,400
JERRY: No, no. I was like... shit... Shit. KATE: Yeah. Okay.

2445
01:58:47,399 --> 01:58:51,460
JERRY: Yeah, anyway. Next up is this crew.

2446
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:54,220
From behind the bar...

2447
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:59,320
you see a hand crossbow come up.

2448
01:59:00,119 --> 01:59:02,180
And he is going to take a shot at you--

2449
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:03,280
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b. RYAN: The fourth guy.

2450
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:04,539
RYAN: The fourth guy. RYAN: Nice.

2451
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:08,900
JERRY: That is 14....  yes. Mm-hmm. KRIS: Yeah, you got me.

2452
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:11,300
AMY: Got him. JERRY: Two points.

2453
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:12,680
KRIS: Okay.

2454
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:14,720
KATE: Wait there's a fourth guy now?

2455
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:16,300
JERRY: No, no, there's the person behind the bar.

2456
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:17,699
RYAN: There was the hand behind the bar.

2457
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:19,279
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the person...

2458
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:21,659
JERRY: it's the rogue. &gt;&gt; KATE: The rogue who just-- RYAN: Oh! The rogue who ran away.

2459
01:59:21,659 --> 01:59:23,659
KRIS: I thought it was like a secret ambush.

2460
01:59:23,659 --> 01:59:24,859
RYAN: I thought it was a secret ambush too!

2461
01:59:24,859 --> 01:59:28,179
RYAN: It's a good story, it was clever. KATE: She's like John McClane-ing it over the bar.

2462
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:30,539
JERRY: Now you're paranoid. RYAN: I am paranoid! Yeah.

2463
01:59:30,539 --> 01:59:31,979
RYAN: Because I'm in a magic house that keeps attacking me!

2464
01:59:31,979 --> 01:59:34,919
KRIS: I love how lame it is that we didn't even check behind here. He's like, he was just right there!

2465
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:36,880
He's like five feet away. Now he's shooting at you.

2466
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,159
JERRY: He was just reading the whole time. KRIS: Okay, so two points of damage for me. All right.

2467
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:44,359
JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: Sure. Right in the...Take it on the arm.

2468
01:59:44,359 --> 01:59:48,099
JERRY: The wizard... is going to...

2469
01:59:48,699 --> 01:59:52,000
scoot around the back edge of the tables and chairs,

2470
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,640
and take up a position behind the barricaded door.

2471
01:59:57,739 --> 02:00:04,679
And you hear the sharp whisper of Magic Missiles

2472
02:00:04,699 --> 02:00:07,579
JERRY: erupt from her hand. KRIS: (whispering) Magic Missile. Magic Missile.

2473
02:00:07,579 --> 02:00:08,800
KRIS: (whispering) Magic Missile.

2474
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:11,439
JERRY: That's seven points for you, Donaar.

2475
02:00:11,939 --> 02:00:14,159
KATE: I still do have Silence going.

2476
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:15,119
JERRY: Yeah.

2477
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:17,659
JERRY: She was able to move far enough out of the-- KATE: Outside my range?

2478
02:00:17,659 --> 02:00:19,340
JERRY: out of the edge. Exactly.

2479
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:20,539
RYAN: I just take it.

2480
02:00:20,539 --> 02:00:23,340
JERRY: Yeah exactly. And the knight... AMY: Uh oh.

2481
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:30,180
JERRY: the knight can do all of his work in a completely silent room.

2482
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:31,020
KATE: That's true.

2483
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:38,159
JERRY: He basically moves up past you. Just scoots you to the side. Just like--

2484
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:40,579
AMY: Rude. JERRY: Well yeah like you would move a chair.

2485
02:00:40,579 --> 02:00:43,180
JERRY: Just pushes you off to the side.

2486
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:50,880
And tries to bring his greatsword down on Rosie Beestinger… with a one.

2487
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:56,319
It doesn't happen at all. Would you like to interpret this one for us, Rosie?

2488
02:00:56,319 --> 02:00:59,779
KATE: Yes, absolutely. Rosie sees-- sorry. (claps)

2489
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:01,439
I see the knight coming.

2490
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:06,539
I plant my quarterstaff down and I wait because I think he's probably an idiot and I'm right.

2491
02:01:06,539 --> 02:01:07,600
JERRY: Yeah, it turns out.

2492
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:14,880
KATE: I don't move at all. The sword comes down slowly and doesn't come close. And I say...

2493
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:16,120
I thought so.

2494
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:18,279
RYAN: Punk.

2495
02:01:18,279 --> 02:01:20,699
KRIS: It sweeps around and just goes back in the sheath.

2496
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:21,939
(laughter)

2497
02:01:21,939 --> 02:01:23,339
JERRY: No, it's just one thing. All right. KRIS: (sheathing sound)

2498
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:24,380
JERRY: No. And then he goes home.

2499
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:27,440
(laughter) KRIS: Just like, puts his hat on.

2500
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:30,199
JERRY: No, tips it. KRIS: Yeah.

2501
02:01:30,979 --> 02:01:35,139
JERRY: Rosie Beestinger, it is auspicious that it is your time to go.

2502
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:39,260
KATE: Okay. So we've got a wizard casting Magic Missiles at Donaar...

2503
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:43,800
We have a rogue shooting a crossbow at you and a knight on me with a greatsword.

2504
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:44,340
JERRY: Mm-hmm.

2505
02:01:44,819 --> 02:01:48,739
KATE: Oh boy, oh boy. Okay. JERRY: Lots of approaches.

2506
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:52,580
JERRY: Got the barricade. All kinds of stuff. KATE: Okay.

2507
02:01:53,739 --> 02:01:57,119
RYAN: Forest Friends. Oh you can't do that. KATE: So certainly what I'm going to do is...

2508
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:01,659
KATE: go after this knight. JERRY: Ooh this is going to be a good fight.

2509
02:02:01,659 --> 02:02:05,439
KATE: Yeah it's gonna be a good fight. I'm also-- so I'm gonna do a regular attack,

2510
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:10,679
I'm also going to spend a ki point and use a power called patient defense.

2511
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:15,300
Which means I dodge as a bonus action and attacks against me have disadvantage.

2512
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:19,520
JERRY: Oh this is going to be sweet. This is like that David and Goliath fight.

2513
02:02:19,859 --> 02:02:22,839
JERRY: That classic technique. KATE: Yeah. Yeah, classic! Classic.

2514
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:26,739
KATE: It's gonna be more like Shadow and Colossus. I'm gonna climb all over this bitch.

2515
02:02:26,739 --> 02:02:30,579
KATE: All right. Soo... oof. JERRY: You're gonna climb up on his back ridge.

2516
02:02:30,579 --> 02:02:32,279
KATE: I'm gonna climb over nothing.

2517
02:02:32,279 --> 02:02:35,639
RYAN: You trip. KATE: Yeah, I got a ten to attack.

2518
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:37,380
KATE: That's not good. That's not good. JERRY: Okay.

2519
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:42,440
JERRY: So you make a quick swipe with the quarterstaff,

2520
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:46,680
and then as he's pulling the sword back up from his previous failed maneuver,

2521
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:48,619
it just clangs against the side.

2522
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:51,880
Donaar.

2523
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:55,460
RYAN: All right, I can-- JERRY: You have a good sense of the scene?

2524
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:59,680
RYAN: Yeah and I've got a vantage point on everyone. I can see everyone, right?

2525
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:01,220
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: All right.

2526
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:04,320
RYAN: They're all within range of me? Correct? JERRY: Mm-hmm.

2527
02:03:04,319 --> 02:03:06,679
RYAN: All right. I'm going to cast Bane.

2528
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:10,860
JERRY: Bane? RYAN: So three creatures of my choice that I can--

2529
02:03:10,859 --> 02:03:13,139
JERRY: My choice! I choose!

2530
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:15,180
AMY: My bane. My choice. RYAN: All right, yeah...

2531
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:17,340
RYAN: They must make charisma saving throws.

2532
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:18,319
JERRY: Okay.

2533
02:03:19,859 --> 02:03:20,920
RYAN: So all three of these...

2534
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,560
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. And then what happens? AMY: All three--

2535
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,980
AMY: of these people at the table with me right now. RYAN: I don't know. Let's see if they made them or not.

2536
02:03:25,479 --> 02:03:26,619
RYAN: And then I'll tell you.

2537
02:03:26,619 --> 02:03:28,439
KRIS: And if they don't, now what?

2538
02:03:28,579 --> 02:03:29,640
JERRY: Uh huh...

2539
02:03:31,659 --> 02:03:32,439
Ugh.

2540
02:03:32,579 --> 02:03:33,539
KRIS: (whispering) I was going to say, why don't you--

2541
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:34,899
JERRY: Wizard's good. KRIS: (whispering) get that door open.

2542
02:03:34,899 --> 02:03:37,359
JERRY: Knight is an F fest and rogue is an F fest. RYAN: (whispering) No.

2543
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:39,159
RYAN: Damn it. KRIS: (whispering) Get that door. Get that door.

2544
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:40,659
JERRY: So two of them RYAN: All right, so...

2545
02:03:40,659 --> 02:03:47,079
RYAN: Those two who failed, whenever they make an attack or a saving throw before the spell ends

2546
02:03:47,079 --> 02:03:50,319
they have to roll a d4 and subtract that from their roll.

2547
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:51,979
JERRY: Oh smooth! KATE: Very nice, very nice.

2548
02:03:51,979 --> 02:03:59,439
JERRY: Yeah so negative d4 plus disadvantage is a pretty good mess for them to be in.

2549
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:02,539
AMY: That's what they get for being mediocre layabouts. RYAN: So they shouldn't be able to hit anyone anymore now, right?

2550
02:04:02,539 --> 02:04:04,319
Theoretically, they're just going be useless.

2551
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:06,500
KRIS/RYAN: (silly "bleh" noises)

2552
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:08,199
JERRY: Yeah yeah...it'll be like pool noodles

2553
02:04:08,199 --> 02:04:10,199
JERRY: (pool noodle whipping noises) RYAN: Yeah.

2554
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:12,279
RYAN: Yeah.

2555
02:04:12,279 --> 02:04:15,859
KRIS: And you relax! RYAN: Yeah, I relax. Fight's essentially over now...

2556
02:04:15,859 --> 02:04:18,479
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, just check it out. Walnut! AMY: Is it?

2557
02:04:18,479 --> 02:04:20,299
KATE: Thanks for carrying us, Donaar.

2558
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:24,920
JERRY: Take it away. So Walnut, he has pushed you to the side.

2559
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,239
You are...

2560
02:04:28,859 --> 02:04:30,519
You sort of wheel around.

2561
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:35,740
It's this first, mindless part, like you have the ability to move but there is this mindless part of you

2562
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:38,319
that longs to destroy your friends.

2563
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:39,420
AMY: Okay.

2564
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,000
KATE: (whispering) That's so-- JERRY: Uh...

2565
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:44,720
JERRY: Specifically in this case, Donaar.

2566
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:47,539
AMY: Mmm... okay. Can I... I guess then I--

2567
02:04:47,539 --> 02:04:49,579
JERRY: Well actually, no, no, I was wrong. K'thriss. KRIS: Mmm.

2568
02:04:49,579 --> 02:04:51,579
AMY: I was going to say Donaar is really far away. RYAN: I was going to say, I'm really far away.

2569
02:04:51,579 --> 02:04:54,539
AMY: I really hate this dragon. RYAN: I'm like, hi, from across the room.

2570
02:04:54,539 --> 02:04:56,859
AMY: I'm like, you! (grunt) JERRY: I don't like you.

2571
02:04:57,699 --> 02:05:01,720
AMY: Okay, I guess then... I mean...

2572
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:04,640
JERRY: Yeah, make your attack roll. AMY: (sigh)

2573
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,520
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: And deal damage to your friend Kris.

2574
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:07,840
KRIS: Go ahead, that's how this works.

2575
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:10,399
AMY: That is a 15.

2576
02:05:10,399 --> 02:05:12,179
KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: Plus five on that scimitar.

2577
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:13,360
KRIS: Yeah. &gt;&gt; RYAN: Good yield. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

2578
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:14,599
AMY: Yeah, it's good. JERRY: It's pro-tier.

2579
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:17,100
JERRY: All right. How much damage does your friend K'thriss take?

2580
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:21,079
AMY: He takes... eight! JERRY: Oh! (sucks in breath)

2581
02:05:21,079 --> 02:05:22,840
KRIS: Whoa. That's not good for me.

2582
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:24,140
KATE: Not looking good. KRIS: That's not good for me.

2583
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:27,360
JERRY: All right now, lets get a wisdom save over there, Walnut.

2584
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:30,300
KRIS: Yeah, I'm past bloodied now.

2585
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:32,720
KATE: Think of all the wisest things you've ever heard.

2586
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:35,199
AMY: Yeah, I look at my druidic focus... please!

2587
02:05:37,079 --> 02:05:38,260
KATE: (sigh) KRIS: Oh!

2588
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:39,919
AMY: Nope! It's an 11.

2589
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:43,640
KRIS: Ugh. JERRY: All right. Next up we've got...

2590
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,840
JERRY: Oh here, so where do you want to move now?

2591
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,039
AMY: Away! RYAN: As far away as possible.

2592
02:05:48,039 --> 02:05:51,039
AMY: I want to move towards the barricade?

2593
02:05:51,039 --> 02:05:52,159
JERRY: Sure. KATE: Toward that wizard.

2594
02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:54,099
JERRY: Yeah, over in the wiz...in the W zone.

2595
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:55,640
AMY: Yeah, I want to go to the W Zone. JERRY: You want to put up a W?

2596
02:05:55,779 --> 02:05:57,179
RYAN: The dubs. JERRY: Okay.

2597
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:58,099
RYAN: Dub trub.

2598
02:05:58,979 --> 02:06:04,659
JERRY: Yeah, just the look of contempt from this wizard is profound.

2599
02:06:05,819 --> 02:06:07,019
K'thriss Drow'b.

2600
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:11,740
KRIS: Whew. All right. Not a lot I can do. I mean my big stuff's gone.

2601
02:06:13,699 --> 02:06:15,199
JERRY: You got potent cantrips.

2602
02:06:15,199 --> 02:06:16,800
KRIS: Well, no. The cantrips are good.

2603
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,579
I'm trying to get that door open.

2604
02:06:19,579 --> 02:06:21,659
JERRY: All right. I like. RYAN: Knock that thing off her head.

2605
02:06:21,659 --> 02:06:23,899
KRIS: Huh? It doesn't--I don't think it works that way.

2606
02:06:23,899 --> 02:06:26,179
AMY: It's translucent. KRIS: Yeah she's got to save out of it.

2607
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:28,180
JERRY: So door upstairs. KRIS: Yeah.

2608
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:29,060
RYAN: Try. JERRY: And...

2609
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:30,800
KRIS: (laughs) AMY: With an arrow.

2610
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:31,699
RYAN: Shoot her in the head.

2611
02:06:31,699 --> 02:06:33,119
JERRY: Okay so you get the door open, yeah. KRIS: Shoot her how?

2612
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:34,920
JERRY: When you say get the door open, you mean the door upstairs and not the--

2613
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:39,039
KRIS: Not the barricaded one. I want to go to the knocking door.

2614
02:06:39,039 --> 02:06:41,359
KATE: Just pull that-- RYAN: Oh up there with me?

2615
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:44,519
KRIS: Yeah. Let me run up there. And on my way up I'm like,

2616
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:45,920
What? Why did she open the door?

2617
02:06:46,199 --> 02:06:49,519
Am I able to get there with my move?

2618
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:51,579
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: Okay.

2619
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:57,920
KRIS: I'm going to make that door open if I'm standing next to it. What am I looking at here? Describe it.

2620
02:06:57,920 --> 02:06:59,980
KRIS: It's just being knocked at from the other side. JERRY: Yeah exactly.

2621
02:07:00,659 --> 02:07:02,699
KRIS: All right. I try the handle. RYAN: You could try like say--

2622
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:04,679
RYAN: Hey, who's in there? And then just say, nope.

2623
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,920
JERRY: I would like to get a strength check from you.

2624
02:07:07,079 --> 02:07:08,939
KRIS: That's the wrong check for me.

2625
02:07:09,579 --> 02:07:12,539
KRIS: But I will-- I can do-- I'll do one. RYAN: (chortle) You'll be like-- (feeble exertion sounds)

2626
02:07:12,539 --> 02:07:14,380
RYAN: Scolding me and then-- (sounds of exertion)

2627
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:16,659
KRIS: I'm going to blow this door wide open! (feeble sound of exertion)

2628
02:07:16,659 --> 02:07:17,720
(laughter)

2629
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:20,119
JERRY: Here. Now don't forget you have some help here.

2630
02:07:20,119 --> 02:07:22,279
KATE: Yeah! &gt;&gt; AMY: You have a lot. KRIS: Okay. Oh yeah I-- okay.

2631
02:07:22,279 --> 02:07:24,179
JERRY: You have cultists. KRIS: I'm going to do that one.

2632
02:07:24,279 --> 02:07:26,259
KRIS: Well yeah, I like that. Cultists. That's nice.

2633
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:27,720
JERRY: They help you out. KATE: (laughing) That's nice.

2634
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:28,840
JERRY: That's nice. Nice cultists.

2635
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:30,279
KRIS: Uh...

2636
02:07:30,279 --> 02:07:31,759
AMY: Try again? KATE: Not too bad?

2637
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:32,980
KRIS: Ooh that's not a bad one. KATE: That's not bad.

2638
02:07:32,979 --> 02:07:34,239
KRIS: Let's see what else I can do. KATE: Roll again.

2639
02:07:35,239 --> 02:07:38,179
KRIS: That's not a good one. Okay so it's going to be a 17.

2640
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:39,340
JERRY: Oh yeah. that's plenty.

2641
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:41,220
KRIS: All right. (grunt) KATE: Nice. &gt;&gt; AMY: Might!

2642
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:42,300
KATE: Yeah. Lifting.

2643
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:44,600
JERRY: It's clearly stuck.

2644
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:48,180
RYAN: You're so impressed. JERRY: There's something designed to keep it closed.

2645
02:07:48,859 --> 02:07:52,699
JERRY: But you are able to break it out. And what you see inside...

2646
02:07:53,899 --> 02:07:56,420
They're knocked back by the opening door,

2647
02:07:56,420 --> 02:08:00,420
you can see someone bound and gagged in the darkness of this room.

2648
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:02,440
AMY: Hmm. Number four?

2649
02:08:02,939 --> 02:08:03,739
KRIS: Yeah.

2650
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:08,279
Am I able to run over there and get that gag off of him?

2651
02:08:08,279 --> 02:08:10,699
JERRY: Yeah but you already did your... KRIS: Okay.

2652
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:11,980
KRIS: My move.

2653
02:08:11,979 --> 02:08:14,059
JERRY: Your move yeah. You can act if you want to.

2654
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:16,180
KATE: Can you Eldritch Blast it off?

2655
02:08:16,579 --> 02:08:18,819
KRIS: (laughs) I'm perplexed and just kill him?

2656
02:08:18,819 --> 02:08:21,219
RYAN: Can you use tendrils to go over there and just be like-- (snip sounds)

2657
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:22,659
Kris: I don't have any of those to use at the moment.

2658
02:08:22,659 --> 02:08:23,960
RYAN: Oh yeah. KATE: (laughing) Scissor tendrils?

2659
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:25,180
RYAN: Yeah. It's a spell, right?

2660
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:28,560
KRIS: Can I Mend that off of him?

2661
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:29,480
JERRY: Can you un-Mend?

2662
02:08:29,479 --> 02:08:33,319
KRIS: I can return him to the state of him *not* having the tied-- on his mouth.

2663
02:08:33,319 --> 02:08:35,099
KRIS: I Mend-- No, okay. KATE: That's pretty rad.

2664
02:08:35,479 --> 02:08:37,979
(laughter) JERRY: You're trying.

2665
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:45,220
KRIS: No that's-- Can I do Guidance on them to allow them to bite it off of himself?

2666
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:48,039
JERRY: No, no, no. But you can probably remove it.

2667
02:08:48,039 --> 02:08:49,140
KRIS: Let's do that.

2668
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:50,180
(laughter)

2669
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:52,180
KRIS: Sounds good. Yeah I take it off of him.

2670
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:53,860
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KRIS: Pull it down.

2671
02:08:53,859 --> 02:08:57,439
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You pull it down and it's just, "Thank the gods. Thank the gods."

2672
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:04,320
It's just like writhing on the back trying to get his hand out of the bindings that they're in.

2673
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:07,480
He's basically-- he's like a grub.

2674
02:09:07,479 --> 02:09:11,399
Basically. He can speak now but he's just like flopping around.

2675
02:09:11,399 --> 02:09:13,619
Next turn you should be able to get him ready to go.

2676
02:09:13,619 --> 02:09:14,439
KRIS: Okay.

2677
02:09:14,819 --> 02:09:16,139
JERRY: That's K'thriss.

2678
02:09:16,199 --> 02:09:19,239
JERRY: Here we come with our interlocutors here. KRIS: (claps)

2679
02:09:19,239 --> 02:09:20,579
AMY: (laughs) KRIS: It wasn't much.

2680
02:09:22,359 --> 02:09:24,579
AMY: You took a gag off of a guy. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

2681
02:09:24,579 --> 02:09:26,380
AMY: It's not... KRIS: An important gag.

2682
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:28,220
AMY: (laughs) JERRY: No, this was a vital gag.

2683
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,580
JERRY: You don't understand. KRIS: It's a beautiful gag too.

2684
02:09:31,399 --> 02:09:33,479
KRIS: It's one incredibly-- AMY: You're going to love your gag.

2685
02:09:33,479 --> 02:09:38,279
JERRY: The hand crossbow fires a bolt at you, Donaar.

2686
02:09:39,739 --> 02:09:42,099
You hear the twang, you feel it's one point of damage.

2687
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:45,000
JERRY: It's an inconvenience. RYAN: This guy hit an 18?

2688
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,060
RYAN: All right. JERRY: It's an inconvenience at best.

2689
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,580
RYAN: Getting low.

2690
02:09:50,579 --> 02:09:52,479
RYAN/AMY: (singing) Get low, get low...

2691
02:09:52,479 --> 02:09:54,079
KRIS: I'm at nine by the way, so...

2692
02:09:54,079 --> 02:09:55,539
RYAN: Is that a lot? Huh?

2693
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:57,640
KATE: I feel fine. AMY: I'm feeling great.

2694
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:58,700
RYAN: Oh great. Yeah.

2695
02:09:59,119 --> 02:10:06,000
JERRY: As you are approaching the barricade and the wizard that has made a home there,

2696
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:07,760
AMY: Shit wizard.

2697
02:10:08,199 --> 02:10:11,639
JERRY: She makes a sign with her right hand and then

2698
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:16,220
holds her hands together and a curtain of flame lances out at you.

2699
02:10:16,359 --> 02:10:17,799
RYAN: Oh. AMY: Great!

2700
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:21,899
AMY: Just what I love. JERRY: Take three points of damage.

2701
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:26,739
JERRY: And you can feel just in the heat of that blast--

2702
02:10:26,739 --> 02:10:29,819
AMY: (shuddering) Ah. JERRY: you can feel the crown sort of disintegrate.

2703
02:10:29,819 --> 02:10:31,619
KATE: (gasps) Tight. RYAN: Hmm.

2704
02:10:31,619 --> 02:10:33,599
AMY: (sucks air through teeth) Get ready to suck on this!

2705
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,800
(laughter)

2706
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,039
RYAN: It's bear-ing time. AMY: (growls)

2707
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:39,039
JERRY: No, this is the drop.

2708
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:40,359
AMY: Yeah. JERRY: This is the drop.

2709
02:10:40,619 --> 02:10:41,880
AMY: (record scratch sound)

2710
02:10:42,699 --> 02:10:47,359
JERRY: We are back to the fight of the ages between this knight.

2711
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:50,939
JERRY: Do you have a 13 armor class? KATE: I certainly do. I have 15.

2712
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:52,060
JERRY: Mm-kay.

2713
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:54,339
AMY: Ain't nothing to Rosie. JERRY: Then you did very well.

2714
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:58,720
JERRY: You didn't even need the disadvantage. It was just a real shit show.

2715
02:10:58,819 --> 02:11:01,539
KATE: Nice. JERRY: All right. Next up...

2716
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:04,520
JERRY: we have Rosie. KATE: Okay.

2717
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:07,880
KATE: So my patient defense... JERRY: Mm-hmm.

2718
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:09,539
KATE: is... is that ongoing?

2719
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:12,079
I spent a ki point. I'm not sure if it's an ongoing effect.

2720
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:14,579
JERRY: That my understanding is that it is, but let me check.

2721
02:11:14,579 --> 02:11:16,319
KATE: Okay. All right. You check for it. I'm going to keep going.

2722
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:17,340
JERRY: Yeah go ahead and figure out your next part.

2723
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:20,600
KATE: All right. So I'm going to do a cool whirly attack.

2724
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,939
JERRY: A cool whirly attack? KATE: Yeah. He's not going to see it coming.

2725
02:11:23,939 --> 02:11:25,799
KATE: I'm going to use an advantage die too.

2726
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:26,480
KRIS: Yeah.

2727
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:29,359
KATE: Which-- okay that was an 18. KRIS: Ooh yes.

2728
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:31,500
KATE: And... seven.

2729
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:33,840
Okay. So 18 plus five is 23.

2730
02:11:34,479 --> 02:11:35,439
JERRY: Mm-kay.

2731
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:38,020
KRIS: Cool whirl. KATE: I did a cool whirl.

2732
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:39,180
AMY: Very cool.

2733
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:40,579
AMY: Wow! KATE: Starring Brad Pitt.

2734
02:11:40,699 --> 02:11:41,500
KRIS: Whoa!

2735
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:43,060
KRIS: Yeah I know that's where it was referenced. KATE: You like that?

2736
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:44,360
KRIS: But I was going-- I hung back. KATE: Yeah, and you're like that's...

2737
02:11:44,359 --> 02:11:46,039
KRIS: Nobody knows that. KATE: Too old. Nope.

2738
02:11:47,239 --> 02:11:48,579
KATE: It's a me. RYAN: What do I...

2739
02:11:48,579 --> 02:11:50,180
JERRY: I like it. We'll keep it. RYAN: If I want to use my...

2740
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:51,380
JERRY: All right. What's the damage on this?

2741
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:55,220
KATE: It is a six. And I will use... RYAN: my acid breath? Do I just do? Do I have to roll anything?

2742
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:58,619
KATE: my martial arts to take an unarmed strike in as well.

2743
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:03,460
Which is an 18.

2744
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:04,380
JERRY: Yowza. KATE: Does that hit?

2745
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:05,380
JERRY: Yeah that's good. KATE: Okay.

2746
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,359
KATE: And then seven. KRIS: Nice.

2747
02:12:08,359 --> 02:12:10,319
KATE: Seven with one punch.

2748
02:12:10,579 --> 02:12:14,859
KATE: Elbow punch right to the groin. JERRY: Yeah you go in and it's just very close.

2749
02:12:14,859 --> 02:12:17,619
JERRY: It's the right height. It's the right height. KATE: Yeah. Perfect height.

2750
02:12:17,619 --> 02:12:19,079
JERRY: You know what's going on in there.

2751
02:12:19,079 --> 02:12:20,460
JERRY: You seen it before. KATE: It's no good.

2752
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:22,340
JERRY: And it's right here. It's one of these.

2753
02:12:22,819 --> 02:12:24,519
AMY: Just laid waste to his groin.

2754
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:28,760
JERRY: Yeah he's just stumbling back, sort of catches himself on a stool.

2755
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:31,420
And pushes himself back up toward the fray.

2756
02:12:31,779 --> 02:12:33,059
Donaar Blit'zen.

2757
02:12:33,239 --> 02:12:36,199
JERRY: Lots of opportunities for you here. RYAN: Yeah...

2758
02:12:36,199 --> 02:12:37,659
KRIS: Feast or battle. JERRY: Puzzle solving...

2759
02:12:37,659 --> 02:12:39,099
AMY: (whispering) Jump off the balcony. RYAN: Puzzle solving?

2760
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:43,620
JERRY: Yeah. The beasts here. These enemies. You have all kinds of cool stuff you can do.

2761
02:12:44,279 --> 02:12:45,859
KRIS: Do something. RYAN: I'm just going to--

2762
02:12:45,859 --> 02:12:47,960
RYAN: I'm going to spit acid at someone. KATE: Yes!

2763
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:51,000
RYAN: I want to spit acid at that stupid wizard. KATE: Yes!

2764
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,979
RYAN: Right in his dumb face. KRIS: Please do.

2765
02:12:52,979 --> 02:12:54,859
RYAN: I don't know how to though, so I pass.

2766
02:12:54,859 --> 02:12:56,000
(laughter)

2767
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,380
JERRY: So you'll need to get closer because this is a...

2768
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:04,060
RYAN: It says five by 30. Am I more than 30 feet away? Where's he?

2769
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:07,200
JERRY: Yeah no I'm just saying like... Walnut is close.

2770
02:13:07,199 --> 02:13:07,939
RYAN: Oh!

2771
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:10,100
Oh to the-- well yeah...

2772
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:13,200
JERRY: You have plenty of leeway to get over there.

2773
02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:14,699
AMY: Just don't roll a one.

2774
02:13:14,899 --> 02:13:17,420
RYAN: No, they didn't even hit me yet. Oh, you're fine though. Okay.

2775
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:18,800
RYAN: All right. Okay. KATE: You have advantage die.

2776
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:21,279
AMY: You do. You have friends in the audience. Who knew?

2777
02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:22,579
RYAN: Oh I'm going to get in there.

2778
02:13:22,579 --> 02:13:23,619
KATE: Okay. Dragon Boys?

2779
02:13:23,939 --> 02:13:25,919
RYAN: But do I hit my-- my Dragon Clan?

2780
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,199
I don't know. I'll come up with a better name than Dragon Boys (laughs)

2781
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:29,920
(laughter) JERRY: The DBs.

2782
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:32,340
KRIS: Dragon-wise. RYAN: My Scalies.

2783
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:34,500
AMY: That's what they're called in the furry community.

2784
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:37,199
(laughter) JERRY: No it's true! I'm going to look it up.

2785
02:13:37,199 --> 02:13:39,179
JERRY: I'm sure there's already enthusiasts. AMY: I didn't have to look it up.

2786
02:13:39,819 --> 02:13:41,539
RYAN: All right. KATE: I knew that as well, Amy.

2787
02:13:41,539 --> 02:13:42,920
RYAN: Good. AMY: Whee.

2788
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:45,220
RYAN: All right, so then scuttle over there. JERRY: Yeah.

2789
02:13:46,159 --> 02:13:47,920
RYAN: Get close enough. Make sure Amy's not in the way.

2790
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,640
JERRY: Yeah just push-- &gt;&gt; AMY: (silently mouths) Walnut! RYAN: And then I hit them with acid.

2791
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:52,100
JERRY: Just like a hand on the face. No. We're here.

2792
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:53,660
KATE: (laughs) RYAN: Yeah. I go, excuse me!

2793
02:13:53,659 --> 02:13:55,599
KRIS: Nyah! RYAN: Thanks for the swing earlier!

2794
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:57,620
RYAN: We'll table this for later.

2795
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,100
And then I go, blegh!

2796
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:01,060
(laughter) RYAN: Like a...

2797
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:03,180
RYAN: (hisses) AMY: Like Jurassic Park?

2798
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:08,140
AMY/RYAN/KATE: (hisses) JERRY: No... Frills, you did not know about, emerge.

2799
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:10,880
The sides of Donaar's cheeks open like a...

2800
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:11,900
AMY: I throw up.

2801
02:14:11,899 --> 02:14:13,439
(laughter)

2802
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:15,039
RYAN: Me too. JERRY: I rolled to vomit.

2803
02:14:15,859 --> 02:14:18,500
KRIS: I love the reasonable, hold on a second-- (vomiting sounds)

2804
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:20,199
(laughter) KRIS: A surge.

2805
02:14:20,199 --> 02:14:22,840
RYAN: Everyone just calm down! (violent vomiting sounds)

2806
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:24,360
(violent vomiting sounds)

2807
02:14:25,899 --> 02:14:30,299
Tears crying. Just like the vomit-- (crying and vomiting sounds)

2808
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:31,640
KATE: Oh... fuck.

2809
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:33,000
(laughter)

2810
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,119
JERRY: Next. KATE: Aw jeez.

2811
02:14:34,119 --> 02:14:36,420
RYAN: All right so... Do I have to roll for this?

2812
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:39,020
Or maybe I didn't write it all down. It just says 2d6 damage.

2813
02:14:39,020 --> 02:14:40,260
KRIS: Why you got to roll to vomit?

2814
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:42,460
RYAN: Do I got to roll to hit? Or something?

2815
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:44,399
KRIS: You roll to not vomit, most of the time.

2816
02:14:44,939 --> 02:14:46,859
JERRY: I'm going to ask my friend, Eric Benson.

2817
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:49,139
RYAN: If I'm doing my... ERIC: Say what?

2818
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:50,260
RYAN: acid breath.

2819
02:14:50,939 --> 02:14:53,359
ERIC: Yeah? RYAN: Do I just roll just a normal attack?

2820
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:55,299
RYAN Do I get--? Okay. No bonus on it, right. ERIC: He makes a save.

2821
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:57,539
RYAN: Does it go towards-- Okay. JERRY: What's the save?

2822
02:14:57,539 --> 02:14:58,720
ERIC: The target makes a con save.

2823
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:00,280
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Gotcha.

2824
02:15:00,279 --> 02:15:02,159
RYAN: DC 12. AMY: We're all learning.

2825
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:04,920
JERRY: Ugh. No. That does not happen.

2826
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:06,140
KATE: Yes! RYAN: All right...

2827
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:07,500
KATE: Describe it to me!

2828
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:08,979
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh! RYAN: Eight.

2829
02:15:08,979 --> 02:15:10,619
KRIS: Aww. &gt;&gt; KATE: Nice. AMY: Paint the picture.

2830
02:15:10,899 --> 02:15:11,759
RYAN: Nice. KRIS: Paint the target.

2831
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,340
KATE: I want to hear every detail. AMY: Theater of the mind.

2832
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:15,860
JERRY: Eight. RYAN: You want me to describe it more in detail?

2833
02:15:15,859 --> 02:15:16,699
KRIS: Chunks. AMY: Transport me.

2834
02:15:16,699 --> 02:15:18,220
RYAN: All right so then after it's all done,

2835
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:21,640
I'm sitting there just like (gasping and gulping sounds) dry heaving afterwards.

2836
02:15:21,640 --> 02:15:23,940
And you're all clapping because it was so impressive.

2837
02:15:23,939 --> 02:15:26,039
It was the most disgusting thing you've ever seen and I'm just like,

2838
02:15:26,039 --> 02:15:27,960
(dry heaving sounds) I did it, guys!

2839
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:29,619
KRIS: Your head's down and you're like, ugh!

2840
02:15:30,319 --> 02:15:32,139
RYAN: Amy's holding my hair.

2841
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:36,020
RYAN: (coughs) I'm just like, I get my toothbrush. (groan)

2842
02:15:36,939 --> 02:15:37,879
That was really gross. I'm sorry.

2843
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:39,760
I'm sorry you had to see that.

2844
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:44,380
JERRY: It starts out as a spray and then just becomes a jet.

2845
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:47,980
AMY: It's like a fire hose. JERRY: A green, translucent jet...

2846
02:15:49,319 --> 02:15:53,539
JERRY: that comes into contact with the wizard.

2847
02:15:54,359 --> 02:15:55,119
RYAN: Mister wizard.

2848
02:15:55,119 --> 02:15:56,559
JERRY: Yeah, with mister wizard.

2849
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:58,000
KRIS: Where on the wizard? The mouth area.

2850
02:15:58,079 --> 02:15:59,840
JERRY: The entire wizard.

2851
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,100
RYAN: (laughing) I just vomit into his mouth.

2852
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:06,380
JERRY: Eight points. The wizard-- Even just from that, the wizard is not looking awesome.

2853
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,680
Is not looking a hundred percent.

2854
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,900
AMY: Who would? KATE: Yeah. She's looked better.

2855
02:16:09,479 --> 02:16:15,679
JERRY: But the corollary aspect of this is that about half of this barricade

2856
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:20,900
is just being winnowed under this liquid doom.

2857
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:22,840
RYAN: Let's open the door and kick them through it.

2858
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:25,119
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: Yeah they don't want to go.

2859
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:25,960
RYAN: Yeah.

2860
02:16:26,699 --> 02:16:33,219
RYAN: Now it's becoming like a torture situ-- now's it's like when they're victims-- Last House on the Left thing.

2861
02:16:33,219 --> 02:16:34,719
Where we're just like-- (wordless sound of aggression)

2862
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:35,760
We'll rise up!

2863
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:38,299
KRIS: No what we're going to do is we're going to capture these guys

2864
02:16:38,299 --> 02:16:40,719
and then put them half-in half-out of that door.

2865
02:16:40,719 --> 02:16:42,079
RYAN: Over and over. KRIS: And just pull.

2866
02:16:42,079 --> 02:16:43,319
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: See what happens.

2867
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:45,840
JERRY: Here so, Walnut Dankgrass...

2868
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:47,940
AMY: Yes. JERRY: Your crown is gone.

2869
02:16:48,379 --> 02:16:52,219
JERRY: You have 100% control of all your deal.

2870
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:55,520
AMY: Finally. (clears throat) So I'm right in front of this wizard.

2871
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:58,399
JERRY: Oh yeah. You are present. AMY: And there's the barricade.

2872
02:16:58,600 --> 02:16:59,819
JERRY: A "bear-icade."

2873
02:16:59,819 --> 02:17:01,020
AMY: A "bear-icade."

2874
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:02,979
KRIS: (air horn sounds) RYAN: (gasp) Are those all the animals you can do?

2875
02:17:02,979 --> 02:17:04,760
RYAN: That's awesome. AMY: Very cool.

2876
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:07,700
JERRY: We need the-- Laura QQ, we definitely need to get a soundboard.

2877
02:17:08,719 --> 02:17:09,899
KATE: Only air horns.

2878
02:17:09,899 --> 02:17:11,399
JERRY: Think about that for next game.

2879
02:17:11,399 --> 02:17:12,600
AMY: All the buttons are air horns.

2880
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:15,059
JERRY: I know you guys are taking notes. Definitely sound horn.

2881
02:17:15,579 --> 02:17:18,200
AMY: Well anyway, this situation looks dire.

2882
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:20,880
I use wild shape.

2883
02:17:21,159 --> 02:17:22,420
JERRY: How wild are we talking about?

2884
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:23,440
KRIS: (snarls) KATE: Hold on! Hold on!

2885
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:25,659
KATE: Start over. This situation what?

2886
02:17:25,659 --> 02:17:27,879
AMY: (clears throat) Walnut looks up and goes,

2887
02:17:27,879 --> 02:17:29,719
This situation looks dire.

2888
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:33,560
And then I use wild shape and transform into a dire wolf.

2889
02:17:33,559 --> 02:17:36,579
And again, it's one of those Teen Wolf things where it's the shot of the hand...

2890
02:17:36,579 --> 02:17:38,579
AMY: And then it just starts cracking. RYAN: And I go, I don't get it!

2891
02:17:38,579 --> 02:17:40,680
JERRY: I didn't see that movie.

2892
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,500
AMY: It's all media with werewolves.

2893
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:45,299
RYAN: Oh. KRIS: What's happening to her?

2894
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:47,559
AMY: And then I turn into an awesome dire wolf,

2895
02:17:47,559 --> 02:17:50,779
and then I look right at this wizard and I want to just like...

2896
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:52,600
JERRY: Feast? AMY: Feast...

2897
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:55,960
AMY: but also use my movement action to just like... KRIS: eat Donaar's barf.

2898
02:17:55,959 --> 02:17:59,479
AMY: try and bust it up into the barricade.

2899
02:17:59,479 --> 02:18:03,819
Like maybe if I were to break it, that would be cool. But if not, that's fine too.

2900
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:05,440
JERRY: So...

2901
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:06,760
AMY: I just want to chomp that face.

2902
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:08,020
JERRY: At root, are you biting?

2903
02:18:08,420 --> 02:18:09,780
AMY: Bite. JERRY: K.

2904
02:18:10,079 --> 02:18:11,120
KATE: Do a bite.

2905
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:12,120
AMY: (humming) RYAN: Yeah do a bite.

2906
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:13,579
JERRY: Do a bite. KRIS: Do a bite through him!

2907
02:18:13,579 --> 02:18:14,739
JERRY: Roll your bite dice.

2908
02:18:14,979 --> 02:18:16,559
MY: Where are my bite dice? RYAN: American Werewolf...

2909
02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:18,239
KRIS: Hit him. &gt;&gt; JERRY: I'm just fucking with you. AMY: Oh my secret...

2910
02:18:18,239 --> 02:18:20,100
AMY: Same dice. RYAN: You want my special dice?

2911
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:23,340
JERRY: Reach into your jowls and get the bite dice.

2912
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:24,559
AMY: (kissing sound) Mielikki.

2913
02:18:26,379 --> 02:18:27,939
KRIS/RYAN: Aww... AMY: Seven.

2914
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:29,540
RYAN: You bite your tongue. JERRY: So it's a wizard...

2915
02:18:29,799 --> 02:18:31,420
JERRY: But what's the attack plus?

2916
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:33,139
AMY: Seven... It's a plus five.

2917
02:18:33,379 --> 02:18:35,039
AMY: So it was a two. Plus a five. RYAN: She rolled a two.

2918
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:35,860
JERRY: Oh!

2919
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:37,100
AMY: So it's a seven.

2920
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:39,940
KRIS: That's not good. JERRY: Oh I thought it was maybe a seven on the dice, Amy!

2921
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:41,440
JERRY: Ugh!

2922
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:42,899
JERRY: (sounds of consternation)

2923
02:18:42,899 --> 02:18:46,299
JERRY: All right. Gross! KATE: She's a dog so she's distracted by the vomit.

2924
02:18:46,299 --> 02:18:47,439
AMY: Let me ask you a question through.

2925
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:49,159
RYAN: Laps up the vomit too. AMY: Let me ask you a question...

2926
02:18:49,159 --> 02:18:49,920
JERRY: Yeah.

2927
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,840
AMY: Is it too late to Summon Furry Friends?

2928
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:53,399
(laughter)

2929
02:18:53,399 --> 02:18:55,239
JERRY: No. KATE: Oh snap!

2930
02:18:55,239 --> 02:18:57,059
JERRY: No. &gt;&gt; KRIS: It's never too late. AMY: It's not too late?

2931
02:18:57,059 --> 02:18:59,239
AMY: What kind of animals can I summon? Whatever I want?

2932
02:18:59,239 --> 02:19:02,420
JERRY: Well you tell me what kind of animals you want to summon and I'll tell you--

2933
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:03,520
AMY: Spiders! RYAN: Skunks. Aww.

2934
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:07,159
KRIS: No. I summon a dire wolf that does what I tried to do.

2935
02:19:07,159 --> 02:19:09,539
JERRY: Yeah. I summon a second dire wolf.

2936
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:12,040
AMY: I don't know. Something rude.

2937
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:14,400
JERRY: Forest Friends. AMY: Squirrels are friends.

2938
02:19:14,399 --> 02:19:16,219
KATE: Nasty ass squirrels. RYAN: Armadillos that come rolling in.

2939
02:19:16,219 --> 02:19:17,739
KATE: Yeah. Nasty boys.

2940
02:19:17,739 --> 02:19:22,280
AMY: Squirrels. But like angry squirrels. You know when they're pissed off and they're all chattering.

2941
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:24,040
KATE: And they're all skinny-- like kind of mangy. KRIS: You know like mange.

2942
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:26,220
KATE: Yeah, yeah. You can see their-- Gross. Yeah. KRIS: Maybe diseased. Yeah, diseased squirrel.

2943
02:19:26,219 --> 02:19:27,599
JERRY: No. Dire squirrels.

2944
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:29,079
KATE: Dire squirrels! AMY: Dire squirrels.

2945
02:19:29,079 --> 02:19:30,600
JERRY: Well there's no dire squirrels.

2946
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:31,819
AMY: Mmm. KATE: (sighs)

2947
02:19:31,819 --> 02:19:33,239
JERRY: But sort of squeezing out-- RYAN: Sugar gliders.

2948
02:19:33,239 --> 02:19:34,619
JERRY: you know how-- KATE: (gasps)

2949
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:36,460
JERRY: Oh, that would be the best. Yay!

2950
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:40,659
JERRY: No, no. Here's how it works... KRIS: (groans in pain)

2951
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:43,280
JERRY: From beyond you see like a...

2952
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:44,120
AMY: Thank you.

2953
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:45,640
JERRY: you see-- Absolutely.

2954
02:19:45,639 --> 02:19:50,260
You see one of the floor boards pop up a little bit.

2955
02:19:50,639 --> 02:19:52,840
JERRY: And 12 squirrels...! KATE: Yes!

2956
02:19:53,299 --> 02:19:57,599
JERRY: Start squeezing their way out of this like, one and a half inch...

2957
02:19:57,899 --> 02:20:04,979
Think just this chain of squirrels are going over there and they're just nipping and biting at the hem of the robe.

2958
02:20:04,979 --> 02:20:05,920
KATE: Nasty. AMY: Yeah.

2959
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:10,460
JERRY: She looks like she is wearing a robe made of squirrels at this point.

2960
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:12,800
AMY: Don't wear fur, but I love that.

2961
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:15,759
JERRY: Living fur. Listen this is a collaboration.

2962
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:17,159
KRIS: Still alive. &gt;&gt; AMY: That's true. It's fine. JERRY: See what I mean?

2963
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:18,280
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b.

2964
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:22,220
JERRY: We're playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. RYAN: So when I attack again I murder all the squirrels over her.

2965
02:20:22,379 --> 02:20:24,239
KRIS: All right I'm in the room with this... RYAN: Are you going to be mad at me?

2966
02:20:24,239 --> 02:20:26,420
KRIS: Describe to me this person I just ungagged.

2967
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:28,820
JERRY: This person...

2968
02:20:29,899 --> 02:20:31,600
Mostly simple dress.

2969
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:34,979
No armor of any kind.

2970
02:20:34,979 --> 02:20:38,579
JERRY: They've clearly been defanged, basically. Right? KRIS: Okay. Yeah.

2971
02:20:39,159 --> 02:20:39,920
AMY: Thank you.

2972
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:43,920
JERRY: But they are ready. They're still just muttering to themselves.

2973
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:46,460
Thanking any god that they think might hear them.

2974
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:48,920
And continuing to writhe like a grub.

2975
02:20:49,079 --> 02:20:52,479
KRIS: All right, let me undo that knot in the back.

2976
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:53,579
KRIS: I just cut it. JERRY: Yeah.

2977
02:20:53,579 --> 02:20:55,600
KRIS: I got a sickle. AMY: That's a lot of drugs.

2978
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:57,079
RYAN: Yeah we're only fighting three.

2979
02:20:57,079 --> 02:20:58,780
JERRY: You just get the sickle out. RYAN: You cool with fighting four now?

2980
02:20:58,780 --> 02:20:59,659
AMY: Got him!

2981
02:20:59,659 --> 02:21:03,239
KRIS: This is an incredible stratagem. RYAN: He reaches up and strangles you.

2982
02:21:03,239 --> 02:21:05,659
KRIS: He's like, aha! And then they just punches me in the mouth.

2983
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:08,079
No, I-- So I freed him.

2984
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:10,779
RYAN: Even now? He's been in captivity for a while. He's all crazy.

2985
02:21:10,780 --> 02:21:12,960
RYAN: He's just lashing out at whatever's in front of him. AMY: He's got Stockholm Syndrome.

2986
02:21:12,959 --> 02:21:14,919
KRIS: Yeah. I'm in trouble.

2987
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:16,760
JERRY: So you... RYAN: I can fight a naked guy.

2988
02:21:16,899 --> 02:21:19,520
JERRY: You slash this back part with the sickle. KRIS: I slash his bonds.

2989
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:21,239
KRIS: I say, do you have any heals?

2990
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:23,340
(laughter)

2991
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,399
JERRY: Heals?

2992
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:27,239
KRIS: I'm sorry. I don't feel good.

2993
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:29,739
JERRY: Yeah. Tell me about it.

2994
02:21:29,739 --> 02:21:31,920
RYAN: I freed you. I'm very vulnerable.

2995
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:34,899
JERRY: He's tied up. He's down. He's worse.

2996
02:21:34,899 --> 02:21:37,699
KRIS: I got a confession. I don't feel good, friend.

2997
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:38,840
All right. Let's go.

2998
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:41,940
RYAN: This guy was all tied up, you cut him free and then rolled over on your back,

2999
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:44,180
and just show your belly and be like, please be nice to me!

3000
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:47,120
JERRY: Oh me! I'm the one with the problem.

3001
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,540
JERRY: Yeah, so you-- KATE: You had it tough.

3002
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:53,220
JERRY: So you're like, "Yeah are you like a--" KRIS: Let me sit there for a second.

3003
02:21:53,219 --> 02:21:57,719
JERRY: "a doctor or something? A cleric? What do you got? What's your deal?"

3004
02:21:57,719 --> 02:22:02,699
No. He's just like as soon as he realizes that you're not going to be any more help,

3005
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:07,719
he just like sit up, reaches down, fixes his feet.

3006
02:22:07,719 --> 02:22:08,679
KRIS: Yeah.

3007
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:13,319
JERRY: There's like a rough stool sort of in this place.

3008
02:22:13,319 --> 02:22:15,840
You think that might have been what was holding the door shut.

3009
02:22:16,879 --> 02:22:21,879
He smashes it against the wall and just comes out with this ragged piece of wood.

3010
02:22:21,879 --> 02:22:22,759
KRIS: Whoa.

3011
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:25,159
JERRY: And then runs out of the room and heads downstairs.

3012
02:22:25,719 --> 02:22:26,760
KATE: Did you say, whoa?

3013
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,780
KRIS: Whoa.

3014
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:28,960
RYAN: "Dude-icle".

3015
02:22:28,959 --> 02:22:30,219
(laughter)

3016
02:22:30,219 --> 02:22:31,000
KRIS: Wha...

3017
02:22:32,559 --> 02:22:36,100
KRIS: You know what, I just want to know what class wields a chair leg.

3018
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:38,720
Like I said. Is that like a finesse weapon?

3019
02:22:38,719 --> 02:22:41,639
RYAN: So you're like, so just for the record, not a cleric? KATE: Is that a finesse weapon?

3020
02:22:41,639 --> 02:22:43,500
RYAN: It's just like doo-doo-doo.

3021
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:45,140
KRIS: So food, or...?

3022
02:22:45,139 --> 02:22:47,840
JERRY: So halfway down the stairs-- KRIS: You had to eat.

3023
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:49,620
JERRY: So you're-- he just runs out.

3024
02:22:49,700 --> 02:22:56,820
You look out. Halfway down the stairs he sort of kicks over the railing.

3025
02:22:57,159 --> 02:23:02,579
And then foot-by-foot on the back of chairs and tables,

3026
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:06,139
jumps up and just brings this down on the knight's head.

3027
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:08,280
KRIS: Oh. Like a club. RYAN: Hey.

3028
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:09,840
AMY: Mmm.

3029
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:13,239
JERRY: It goes right past the head and just connects with the pauldron.

3030
02:23:13,239 --> 02:23:16,459
It's like a pleasing sort of xylophone sound.

3031
02:23:16,459 --> 02:23:19,339
KRIS: Yeah. It's okay. He's tired. He's sore from the...

3032
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:20,319
JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: Yeah.

3033
02:23:20,319 --> 02:23:21,879
JERRY: The... AMY: Chafed.

3034
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:27,840
JERRY: The wizard is trying desperately to cast a spell.

3035
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:30,040
It's not the type of magic you're familiar with.

3036
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:36,540
But you can tell that she has started and failed three or four times.

3037
02:23:36,959 --> 02:23:40,019
In the space there's always another squirrel.

3038
02:23:41,319 --> 02:23:43,719
There's always one additional squirrel.

3039
02:23:43,879 --> 02:23:46,519
JERRY: That has to be... Yeah exactly. KRIS: (sputters)

3040
02:23:46,520 --> 02:23:47,319
RYAN: Squirrel cloud.

3041
02:23:47,319 --> 02:23:49,899
JERRY: That has to be managed. Yes Cloud of-- Cone of Squirrels!

3042
02:23:49,899 --> 02:23:51,899
JERRY: It's Cone of Squirrels. AMY: Ah!

3043
02:23:52,079 --> 02:23:52,940
JERRY: 3rd-level.

3044
02:23:55,159 --> 02:23:58,280
She is not able to do much this turn.

3045
02:23:58,280 --> 02:24:00,060
AMY: Aha! JERRY: The knight...

3046
02:24:00,059 --> 02:24:03,899
JERRY: This cled-- You saw this stick clang down.

3047
02:24:03,899 --> 02:24:06,139
You recognize this technique.

3048
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:08,700
JERRY: You have seen this. KATE: I see.

3049
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:12,159
JERRY: You learned it a long time ago. But you have seen it before.

3050
02:24:12,159 --> 02:24:12,860
KATE: Okay.

3051
02:24:15,139 --> 02:24:18,539
JERRY: The knight is trying to take a swing at you. What's your AC?

3052
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:20,820
KATE: 15. JERRY: No. He doesn't.

3053
02:24:20,819 --> 02:24:25,779
JERRY: So he's continuing to just bring this thing down on both sides of you without actually finding--

3054
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:28,420
KATE: It's like I'm not even moving. I'm not trying. JERRY: Yeah exact-- No. You're just staying.

3055
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:31,379
JERRY: It's just always wrong. It's just whatever way he wants to do it--

3056
02:24:31,379 --> 02:24:33,559
KATE: Anytime he comes down I go, wrong. Wrong!

3057
02:24:33,559 --> 02:24:36,600
JERRY: Also-- also-- also incorrect. KATE: Bad.

3058
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:40,059
KRIS: You just sort of swat at him for his form. Straighten up.

3059
02:24:40,059 --> 02:24:42,000
KATE: (laughs) Back tight.

3060
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,540
JERRY: Exactly. KATE: Glutes engaged.

3061
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:45,960
JERRY: This... the rogue...

3062
02:24:47,659 --> 02:24:59,500
slips over the bar and then you see her drop the hand crossbow this way, and then a knife comes out.

3063
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:02,440
And there's something going on between these two.

3064
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:07,479
Kris: Oh between the rogue and the-- JERRY: Between the person that you freed.

3065
02:25:09,659 --> 02:25:13,020
JERRY: Yeah. She catches him. Real good.

3066
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:15,000
KRIS: (whispering) Dang it. Darn.

3067
02:25:15,799 --> 02:25:19,000
RYAN: You didn't throw her a-- Bane? Even with the Bane?

3068
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:21,460
KRIS: Even with Bane.

3069
02:25:21,459 --> 02:25:22,939
JERRY: It was a really, really high roll.

3070
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:25,840
AMY: It's the highest of rolls. RYAN: Hmm.

3071
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:29,480
JERRY: So just in the middle of these attacks,

3072
02:25:29,479 --> 02:25:34,579
she's just taking this opportunity to just sort of rake along the flank with the dagger.

3073
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:37,120
Rosie Beestinger.

3074
02:25:37,879 --> 02:25:43,239
KATE: I'm going to continue my assault on this terrible knight. Just the worst knight.

3075
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,979
JERRY: This has been the worst knight.

3076
02:25:44,979 --> 02:25:46,420
KATE: This has been the worst knight.

3077
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:47,780
AMY: Hmm. RYAN: Hard day's knight.

3078
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:48,760
KRIS: He's not great.

3079
02:25:49,579 --> 02:25:53,059
KRIS: (hums) KATE: Nope. That's not good.

3080
02:25:53,059 --> 02:25:54,779
JERRY: Rosie, you have advantage. Would you like to use it?

3081
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:56,880
KATE: Yeah I'm going to use my advantage. Thank you!

3082
02:25:56,879 --> 02:25:59,239
KATE: Yeah, I'm going to do that. JERRY: Don't forget the cool channel people.

3083
02:25:59,239 --> 02:26:00,559
KATE: Oof. KRIS: (groans)

3084
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:01,699
JERRY: That is not how you should use advantage.

3085
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:04,640
KATE: No. I rolled a two, and then I rolled a three.

3086
02:26:04,639 --> 02:26:07,219
JERRY: The funny thing about Rosie is that it's better if she rolls a one.

3087
02:26:07,219 --> 02:26:09,279
RYAN: Yeah so you're trending up. The next one will be...

3088
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:11,020
KATE: Could be a four. RYAN: is a couple more of those.

3089
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:12,260
KRIS: Could be a Fibonacci. JERRY: All right. Donaar.

3090
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:13,540
KRIS: You could make it leaps and bounds.

3091
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:14,500
JERRY: Exactly.

3092
02:26:14,559 --> 02:26:15,359
RYAN: Uh...

3093
02:26:15,379 --> 02:26:16,500
JERRY: Over there by this-- AMY: Still barfy?

3094
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:19,020
JERRY: Yeah still running out. RYAN: Yeah.

3095
02:26:19,319 --> 02:26:21,760
JERRY: The tip-- dribbles of it from the nostril.

3096
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:23,739
KRIS: Oh yuck. RYAN: Imma finish what I started.

3097
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:26,140
RYAN: Bring out the big boy.

3098
02:26:26,139 --> 02:26:27,199
Oh yeah. I can't recharge it.

3099
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,340
JERRY: Is there a name for this sword?

3100
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:30,500
RYAN: No, just the toothbrush.

3101
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:33,000
And I pull out the toothbrush.

3102
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:34,399
KRIS: No, the sword is called Toothbrush. RYAN: Yeah.

3103
02:26:34,399 --> 02:26:35,840
(laughter)

3104
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:37,180
AMY: Dental hygiene is very important! JERRY: Ragnir's Toothbrush!

3105
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:38,260
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: Right?

3106
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:40,540
RYAN: And I just go... JERRY: Bristles.

3107
02:26:41,399 --> 02:26:42,440
RYAN: Right at him.

3108
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:45,260
JERRY: Let's see it. RYAN: No pomp or circumstance. Just whoop!

3109
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:46,360
JERRY: Over the top. RYAN/KRIS: Yeah.

3110
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:47,300
JERRY: What do you got?

3111
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:52,680
AMY: Hmm... Mmm! The plus? KRIS: Oh cleave this guy.

3112
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:53,659
RYAN: Yeah um... JERRY: Plus five.

3113
02:26:53,659 --> 02:26:55,319
AMY: 14. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Give him a chop! RYAN: Yeah so 14.

3114
02:26:55,319 --> 02:26:57,079
JERRY: Yeah. Absolutely. Let's see the damage.

3115
02:26:58,719 --> 02:27:01,019
AMY: Chop chop. All of it. RYAN: 2d6 plus 3.

3116
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:01,819
KATE: (gasp)

3117
02:27:02,739 --> 02:27:03,579
RYAN: Seven.

3118
02:27:03,899 --> 02:27:04,920
Uh...

3119
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:07,840
I will...

3120
02:27:08,299 --> 02:27:09,739
RYAN: divine smite as well. JERRY: Yeah?

3121
02:27:09,739 --> 02:27:13,039
RYAN: Deal any damage with melee, add radiant damage in the form of 2d8.

3122
02:27:13,319 --> 02:27:14,760
KRIS: (whispers) Yes... JERRY: Whoa! God. &gt;&gt; AMY: Oh yeah.

3123
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:16,120
AMY: Good night. KRIS: Unload. Yes.

3124
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:17,660
JERRY: It's à la mode? KRIS: Right.

3125
02:27:17,659 --> 02:27:18,840
JERRY: Is that what you said? KRIS: Yeah.

3126
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:19,780
RYAN: Where are my eights...

3127
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:21,600
AMY: That's what I said, it was much funnier. JERRY: We have to maintain--

3128
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:23,979
JERRY: "à la mode" as a piece of terminology.

3129
02:27:23,979 --> 02:27:25,359
RYAN: That's a 12... JERRY: Here you go. There's your eight.

3130
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:26,900
KRIS: Wasn't mine. (laughs)

3131
02:27:26,899 --> 02:27:29,340
RYAN: This one always looks like the other one.

3132
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:30,739
JERRY: It's always hiding.

3133
02:27:31,139 --> 02:27:32,180
AMY: You got it.

3134
02:27:32,180 --> 02:27:32,979
RYAN: Three...

3135
02:27:33,879 --> 02:27:35,379
three, so six more.

3136
02:27:35,379 --> 02:27:37,959
JERRY: Okay, so here's-- KRIS: Where was that hiding?

3137
02:27:37,959 --> 02:27:40,500
JERRY: So here's what you see, Dire Wolf Walnut.

3138
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:41,440
Dire Walnut.

3139
02:27:42,139 --> 02:27:43,439
AMY: Ruh! (laughing)

3140
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:46,480
JERRY: Just squirrels everywhere. Then...

3141
02:27:46,479 --> 02:27:47,899
AMY: Neat. JERRY: the sword...

3142
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:50,020
JERRY: comes over...

3143
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:52,340
just like catches right on its side,

3144
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:55,880
and it's like you see the wizard sort of slump but like,

3145
02:27:55,879 --> 02:27:57,959
"I made it. I did it."

3146
02:27:57,959 --> 02:27:59,699
AMY: And then? JERRY: "I'm going to have another turn,"

3147
02:27:59,700 --> 02:28:01,540
JERRY: "I'm going to use my best spells,"

3148
02:28:01,540 --> 02:28:03,440
"and I'm going to get out of this situation."

3149
02:28:03,440 --> 02:28:04,780
AMY: Oh god!

3150
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:06,180
KATE: Get home to see my family.

3151
02:28:06,379 --> 02:28:13,479
JERRY: And then a sound like a hammer on an anvil just pounds through the entire place.

3152
02:28:13,479 --> 02:28:22,959
Like furniture shifts slightly as just a piston of force just smashes the wizard into the wood floor.

3153
02:28:23,260 --> 02:28:24,219
KRIS: Oh!

3154
02:28:24,219 --> 02:28:26,439
KATE: And all the squirrels? AMY: And the feast begins!

3155
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:28,579
JERRY: The squirrels are annihilated! RYAN: The squirrels go-- (soft explosion sound)

3156
02:28:28,579 --> 02:28:29,819
RYAN: Like everywhere. JERRY: No, no.

3157
02:28:29,819 --> 02:28:32,459
JERRY: No, it's like confetti! AMY: Rendered into a fine mist.

3158
02:28:32,819 --> 02:28:34,279
RYAN: I say, sorry about your squirrels!

3159
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:37,060
KRIS: No you go, oh they got away! RYAN: I know you're really attached to those mice.

3160
02:28:37,059 --> 02:28:38,819
KRIS: They-- they escaped. RYAN: (laughing) I hope you weren't as attached to the squirrels.

3161
02:28:38,819 --> 02:28:40,600
JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: That's... how that works.

3162
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:42,860
KATE: Walnut's already eating them. Is that what happened?

3163
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:45,159
AMY: (pants) I'm just like drinking the blood from the air.

3164
02:28:45,159 --> 02:28:46,219
JERRY: (growling/gargling noises)

3165
02:28:46,219 --> 02:28:47,840
JERRY: Yeah. AMY: Ah!

3166
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:49,540
JERRY: That's Donaar. Uh... Walnut.

3167
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:50,899
The Dire Walnut.

3168
02:28:51,719 --> 02:28:53,500
JERRY: What's the situation? AMY: Who's left?

3169
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:57,379
JERRY: We have a knight who is fighting a new challenger.

3170
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:59,180
AMY: Right. KATE: Rosie's not doing anything to him.

3171
02:28:59,299 --> 02:29:01,219
AMY: Can I get to that knight?

3172
02:29:01,219 --> 02:29:02,260
AMY: I can get to that knight. JERRY: Oh yeah. Easily.

3173
02:29:02,260 --> 02:29:04,620
AMY: Oh cool. Then I want to bite the knight.

3174
02:29:04,959 --> 02:29:06,619
JERRY: (singing) Knight biter...

3175
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:08,720
AMY: (laughing) Knight biter. (singing) Knight biter!

3176
02:29:08,719 --> 02:29:10,959
JERRY: It's a shadowy flight into the dangerous world...

3177
02:29:10,959 --> 02:29:12,899
AMY: Oh. 14. JERRY: of a dire wolf...

3178
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,159
JERRY: that does not exist. AMY: 14.

3179
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:18,739
JERRY: Now would you like to use your advantage dice? It's fine.

3180
02:29:18,979 --> 02:29:20,899
AMY: What? (shouting) Oh my goodness!

3181
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,420
AMY: I didn't know I had one. JERRY: Them nuts.

3182
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:23,719
RYAN: You got one back. JERRY: Them nuts. They got you.

3183
02:29:23,719 --> 02:29:24,879
AMY: I would love to!

3184
02:29:25,079 --> 02:29:26,899
Oh you guys. Wink.

3185
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:29,780
Or do I? Yay! 20.

3186
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:31,880
KRIS: It's like your...fourth?

3187
02:29:31,879 --> 02:29:33,259
AMY: No, no. It was a cumulative 20. KRIS: Okay.

3188
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:34,860
JERRY: So remember-- AMY: I mean yes.

3189
02:29:34,860 --> 02:29:38,700
JERRY: So... in the periphery of your awareness.

3190
02:29:38,879 --> 02:29:39,519
AMY: Yes.

3191
02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:43,799
JERRY: You're pulling in so much new information as this form.

3192
02:29:43,879 --> 02:29:44,839
AMY: (sniffs)

3193
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:49,920
JERRY: You know that the sword has just been whiffing each time.

3194
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:53,739
You know that it is not connecting with Rosie Beestinger.

3195
02:29:54,579 --> 02:29:59,120
You turn and your awareness is filled with this prey.

3196
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:01,280
And you just leap and pounce.

3197
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:02,760
AMY: I sure do!

3198
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:04,379
I sure do.

3199
02:30:04,379 --> 02:30:05,619
For an amount, probably.

3200
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:07,340
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I would roll an amount.

3201
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:08,940
KATE: Yeah. Big amount. KRIS: Where's that bite?

3202
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:10,480
AMY: Yeah just get his-- RYAN: Go for the haunch.

3203
02:30:10,479 --> 02:30:12,420
AMY: Just get his haunches in my mouth. (slurp sound)

3204
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:13,659
So that is a ten.

3205
02:30:13,659 --> 02:30:15,180
JERRY: Savory! Oh man.

3206
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:16,600
JERRY: Yeah it's-- AMY: (lip smacking sound)

3207
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:19,040
RYAN: That haunch meat. Best cut.

3208
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,140
AMY: Oh good. JERRY: It's bad. You find...

3209
02:30:21,139 --> 02:30:24,760
AMY: I feel that glorious blood dripping into my mouth. JERRY: No. It's hot!

3210
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:26,319
JERRY: It is hot! AMY: It's sweet.

3211
02:30:26,319 --> 02:30:27,779
KRIS: It's like a Brazilian steakhouse.

3212
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:31,600
JERRY: You catch the back of his knee.

3213
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:39,720
And you know, just thousands of years of natural wisdom, like this is the place.

3214
02:30:40,139 --> 02:30:41,840
This is how we find prey.

3215
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:43,040
AMY: This is how we do it.

3216
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:44,260
JERRY: This is how we do it.

3217
02:30:45,479 --> 02:30:47,379
JERRY: We can all hear it, right? AMY/KATE/JERRY: Yeah.

3218
02:30:47,379 --> 02:30:49,679
RYAN: Oh. Are we out of time? JERRY: Yeah. It's bad.

3219
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,880
JERRY: It's all good. It's all good.

3220
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:54,059
Next up we have K'thriss.

3221
02:30:54,219 --> 02:30:55,739
KRIS: All right. Um...

3222
02:30:55,739 --> 02:30:56,940
RYAN: (whispering) Like the clock is--

3223
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:58,720
JERRY: Deal with these problems, K'thriss. AMY: (whispering) Yeah we're allowed to keep going.

3224
02:30:58,719 --> 02:31:00,039
KRIS: We got this clown-- KATE: Fix it.

3225
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:02,719
KRIS: Uh... (voice rattling sound)

3226
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:04,800
Who's looking-- Okay you're on the knight.

3227
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:05,719
AMY: Mmm.

3228
02:31:05,719 --> 02:31:07,559
KRIS: Where's this rogue? AMY: Bark.

3229
02:31:07,559 --> 02:31:09,139
JERRY: The rogue is right by the knight,

3230
02:31:09,139 --> 02:31:12,579
because the rogue is fighting the new challenger who came down the stairs.

3231
02:31:12,899 --> 02:31:13,859
AMY: Your pal.

3232
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:16,180
KRIS: All right I'm going to...

3233
02:31:16,180 --> 02:31:17,059
JERRY: From the top deck?

3234
02:31:17,059 --> 02:31:18,719
KRIS: Yeah from the top deck because-- well...

3235
02:31:18,719 --> 02:31:21,119
Yeah I can do Vicious Mockery on them. 60 feet?

3236
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:22,860
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KRIS: All right let's give it a shot.

3237
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:24,079
JERRY: Plenty of room. KRIS: Yeah.

3238
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:29,100
KRIS: Saving throw. I tell that rogue, I say,

3239
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,899
We're all going through that door.

3240
02:31:31,899 --> 02:31:33,879
We are all leaving this bar.

3241
02:31:33,879 --> 02:31:36,920
JERRY: Every one of us. KRIS: Everyone is going to leave here.

3242
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:38,820
KRIS: And not get to come back.

3243
02:31:38,819 --> 02:31:41,719
JERRY: This roll did not succeed. What happens to my rogue?

3244
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:43,380
KRIS: He relaxes.

3245
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:44,920
(laughter)

3246
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:46,620
KRIS: She has a great night.

3247
02:31:46,739 --> 02:31:49,039
Let's see, hold on, on a fail...

3248
02:31:49,739 --> 02:31:51,260
Uh... buh-buh-buh-buh-bup….

3249
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:53,940
But that's if they fail a saving throw.

3250
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:56,160
KRIS: I think-- JERRY: It did.

3251
02:31:56,159 --> 02:31:57,819
KRIS: I think-- Oh they did fail. Okay. KATE: Yeah. They did. She gets--

3252
02:31:57,819 --> 02:32:01,479
KRIS: 1d4 damage and you get a disadvantage on the next attack.

3253
02:32:02,739 --> 02:32:05,059
So you're going to take... a three.

3254
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:08,300
Three sweet damages.

3255
02:32:08,299 --> 02:32:10,239
AMY: (laughs) Three sweet damage. JERRY: Mm-hmm.

3256
02:32:10,239 --> 02:32:12,559
KRIS: Three tender little damages, yeah. JERRY: Love it. Mm-hmm.

3257
02:32:12,559 --> 02:32:14,019
JERRY: Yeah. Tender vittles?

3258
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:15,800
KRIS: I'm going to try to remember that disadvantage.

3259
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:20,100
JERRY: All right. The knight has a...

3260
02:32:20,559 --> 02:32:21,920
giant dog.

3261
02:32:22,260 --> 02:32:25,500
A giant, evil dog literally drinking its life blood.

3262
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:27,979
AMY: (slurping sounds) Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark. JERRY: Out of its calf.

3263
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:30,700
RYAN: Aooga.

3264
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:32,540
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You think that-- Oh that's...

3265
02:32:32,540 --> 02:32:33,780
KRIS: (faint truck horn sound)

3266
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:38,060
JERRY: I put the one-- I put the Acquisitions Incorporated logo on the one. That's the joke.

3267
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:43,579
That does not-- So probably because of this giant dog anchor.

3268
02:32:43,579 --> 02:32:44,440
AMY: Mm-hmm.

3269
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:50,860
JERRY: He tries to bring his sword over toward this new threat and is not able to.

3270
02:32:50,860 --> 02:32:53,260
AMY: Of course not! Because I am so fearsome.

3271
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:56,880
KRIS: This knight hasn't done shit! &gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: We are rapidly approaching gazelle leg...

3272
02:32:57,159 --> 02:32:59,619
JERRY: type situation. &gt;&gt; KRIS: (laughs) AMY: Ooh yeah! I've seen Planet Earth.

3273
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:01,120
JERRY: It's not what we want.

3274
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:02,480
AMY: Hmm. JERRY: Right?

3275
02:33:02,479 --> 02:33:03,619
AMY: It's what I want. JERRY: The...

3276
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:08,480
JERRY: You can see that the new challenger actually rushes toward the door.

3277
02:33:09,239 --> 02:33:11,459
Does not engage in combat.

3278
02:33:11,459 --> 02:33:13,359
KRIS: Yeah. The barricade. JERRY: Rushes toward the door.

3279
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:15,380
JERRY: The... rogue-- AMY: That's good. Don't engage.

3280
02:33:15,379 --> 02:33:17,439
JERRY: The rogue is trying to swipe...

3281
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:18,220
Oh!

3282
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:19,560
AMY: All our money? JERRY: Ah!

3283
02:33:19,559 --> 02:33:20,719
JERRY: The disadvantage. KRIS: Disadvantage.

3284
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:24,500
JERRY: The rogue is trying to swipe at them as they pass,

3285
02:33:24,639 --> 02:33:31,199
but he's literally like walking-- like one of his feet just goes right on the knight's head. It's very nimble.

3286
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:32,620
JERRY: You know about it. KATE: Very impressed.

3287
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:40,420
JERRY: Right over. And then he is just pulling these half-formed chunks of furniture out of the way.

3288
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:41,440
Throwing them behind him.

3289
02:33:42,879 --> 02:33:44,159
That's his turn.

3290
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:45,420
AMY: And what a turn.

3291
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:46,540
JERRY: Yeah exactly. RYAN: (laughs)

3292
02:33:47,139 --> 02:33:52,260
JERRY: The rogue is going to try to put... she's going to try and put a dagger in you...

3293
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:56,060
What is your armor class in your wolven form?

3294
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:57,920
AMY: Ah... My AC.

3295
02:33:58,360 --> 02:33:59,500
A number!

3296
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:00,139
14.

3297
02:34:00,139 --> 02:34:01,219
JERRY: No, that's too high.

3298
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:03,740
Nothing happens.

3299
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:05,700
Like you just bare your teeth.

3300
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:09,940
Comes over to you, bare your teeth, the dagger just glints right off of one of your canines.

3301
02:34:10,059 --> 02:34:10,779
AMY: Ding.

3302
02:34:12,059 --> 02:34:15,299
Next up we have Rosie Beestinger.

3303
02:34:15,299 --> 02:34:19,239
KATE: I'm going to make this attack work this time. I'm going to use another advantage!

3304
02:34:19,239 --> 02:34:21,579
We're going to do this. I'm attacking the...

3305
02:34:22,639 --> 02:34:23,939
rogue, actually.

3306
02:34:23,940 --> 02:34:24,680
JERRY: Nice. KRIS: Okay yeah.

3307
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:26,540
KATE: I'm going to switch focus because I just used-- JERRY: Going to switch your flow?

3308
02:34:26,540 --> 02:34:27,580
AMY: The knight's useless.

3309
02:34:27,579 --> 02:34:29,319
KATE: Yeah the knight's-- I'm just pecking-- JERRY: There's nothing there.

3310
02:34:29,319 --> 02:34:31,299
KRIS: He's fine. AMY: He's there for comedic effect at this point.

3311
02:34:31,299 --> 02:34:33,519
KATE: He's not awesome. Right. JERRY: The knight is food.

3312
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:35,200
JERRY: You rolling your advantage? KATE: Yeah.

3313
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:36,760
KATE: That's a 12.

3314
02:34:37,639 --> 02:34:40,319
JERRY: No, that's not going to do it. That's not going to do it.

3315
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:42,820
AMY: She means well. JERRY: Yeah, yeah. She's doing her best.

3316
02:34:42,819 --> 02:34:44,699
KRIS: It's a battle of minds. KATE: It's been a long day.

3317
02:34:44,700 --> 02:34:46,820
KRIS: This knight and this monk are just looking at each other! JERRY: Donaar. We have a rogue,

3318
02:34:46,819 --> 02:34:51,079
JERRY: we have a knight who is in a really bad spot.

3319
02:34:51,819 --> 02:34:52,779
KATE: Oh wait!

3320
02:34:53,219 --> 02:34:57,099
But I can-- even though I missed my attack, I forgot to do this last time-- I can still take an unarmed...

3321
02:34:57,100 --> 02:34:57,960
JERRY: Do it. KATE: I'm going to do that.

3322
02:34:57,959 --> 02:34:59,259
RYAN: Hostage? Oh. KATE: All right. Stay in front of it.

3323
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:00,960
(laughter)

3324
02:35:00,959 --> 02:35:02,739
KATE: A meat shield. JERRY: "We're getting out of here!"

3325
02:35:02,739 --> 02:35:04,840
KATE: Yeah. Ugh still a 12.

3326
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:05,940
JERRY: Yep. Next up. KATE: Hate that die.

3327
02:35:06,219 --> 02:35:07,699
JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen.

3328
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:08,700
RYAN: Um...

3329
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:12,520
RYAN: So I'm still over by the door with...

3330
02:35:12,520 --> 02:35:14,479
RYAN: what little rubble that's left there? JERRY: Yeah it's all close--

3331
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:18,359
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. It is very close to being cleared.

3332
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:20,100
RYAN: Just clear that out while I'm over there. KRIS: Pop that--

3333
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:21,739
KRIS: That-- yeah. RYAN: Clear it all over.

3334
02:35:21,739 --> 02:35:25,180
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. With your strength, this is not a complex thing.

3335
02:35:25,180 --> 02:35:30,500
The fact of the matter is that a lot of the cellulose-- a lot of it has been eaten away.

3336
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:32,780
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: It's just light to the touch.

3337
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:34,819
JERRY: You just sweep it aside.

3338
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:36,840
RYAN: Then I open the door.

3339
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:40,280
(laughter) JERRY: Yep. You open the door. You recognize it exactly.

3340
02:35:42,579 --> 02:35:43,780
KRIS: What are we looking at? RYAN: I like this.

3341
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:45,300
RYAN: What am I looking at here?

3342
02:35:45,299 --> 02:35:46,979
(laughter) AMY: (singing) And I see...

3343
02:35:46,979 --> 02:35:48,039
KRIS: Much of that darkness, right?

3344
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:49,740
RYAN: Yeah. Is the darkness like normal?

3345
02:35:49,739 --> 02:35:50,959
JERRY: Yeah you know exactly what it is. RYAN: All right.

3346
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:54,420
RYAN: And then I go... who's closer to me? AMY: Bye.

3347
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:56,920
RYAN: Yeah I know. I'm just like, see you guys. AMY: That is Donaar.

3348
02:35:56,920 --> 02:36:00,100
KRIS: Good luck! A hundred percent for me. RYAN: You guys got this. Yeah.

3349
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:03,079
RYAN: And I pull it shut behind me. Uh...

3350
02:36:03,079 --> 02:36:03,799
JERRY: (laughs) Yeah.

3351
02:36:03,799 --> 02:36:05,899
KRIS: I vomit on it. It won't open. JERRY: Bye! (vomit sounds)

3352
02:36:06,719 --> 02:36:09,579
RYAN: Who's closest to me? The knight or the...

3353
02:36:10,079 --> 02:36:12,500
Are either within range for me to yoink at?

3354
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:15,360
JERRY: With your massive sword? RYAN: Yeah.

3355
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:20,500
JERRY: You could probably take a quick swipe at the knight if you wanted to.

3356
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:21,940
The rogue is just beyond.

3357
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:23,500
RYAN: Hmm I'm going to go-- KRIS: Knight-swiper.

3358
02:36:23,500 --> 02:36:25,159
RYAN: I'm going to throw the rogue through the door.

3359
02:36:25,159 --> 02:36:26,399
KRIS: I know I want to punch--

3360
02:36:26,399 --> 02:36:29,219
RYAN: I want to throw one of them into the next room.

3361
02:36:29,219 --> 02:36:31,879
JERRY: Just wait your turn. I mean, you can do what you want.

3362
02:36:31,879 --> 02:36:33,179
RYAN: Well I mean if I-- JERRY: You just can't do it now.

3363
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:33,880
RYAN: Okay.

3364
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,040
JERRY: Walnut.

3365
02:36:37,059 --> 02:36:38,500
AMY: I bite... JERRY: Dire Walnut.

3366
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:41,500
AMY: I bite even harder!

3367
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:42,719
JERRY: Yeah. Let's see it.

3368
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,159
JERRY: Oh hold on. AMY: I'm going to bite him in a new place.

3369
02:36:45,159 --> 02:36:48,920
JERRY: You bite even harder, but I'm going to say at this point...

3370
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:51,540
KRIS/RYAN/KATE: Oh... JERRY: the bloodlust...

3371
02:36:51,719 --> 02:36:53,939
JERRY: has just made you mad with hunger.

3372
02:36:53,940 --> 02:36:54,600
AMY: Oh no.

3373
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:59,180
JERRY: I'm going to throw a disadvantage that my people got me.

3374
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:01,540
AMY: All right well we'll see. Maybe I'll do two really good rolls.

3375
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:04,440
Well that's an eight and that's not good. Don't worry about it.

3376
02:37:04,899 --> 02:37:06,739
Oh and the other one was an 18.

3377
02:37:06,739 --> 02:37:09,879
AMY: Yeah eight plus five so 13. JERRY: Ugh. So you're just like...

3378
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:15,840
JERRY: blood soaked jowls. Just snapping at him while he's trying desperately to get away.

3379
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:16,739
K'thriss Drow'b.

3380
02:37:16,739 --> 02:37:18,219
AMY: Yip. Yip yip yip.

3381
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:19,579
Not that kind of bark.

3382
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:22,139
KRIS: Let's see what I got here...

3383
02:37:22,139 --> 02:37:24,539
I'm trying to figure out whether or not I need to come downstairs.

3384
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:26,460
(laughter) Or I'm just like, this is pretty good.

3385
02:37:26,459 --> 02:37:27,299
JERRY: In your robe?

3386
02:37:27,299 --> 02:37:29,939
KRIS: I peek from the balcony. KATE: You're sitting there like, I don't want any part in that.

3387
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:36,659
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. We're talking about a dangerously damaged knight,

3388
02:37:36,879 --> 02:37:41,459
and a rogue that has seen better days.

3389
02:37:42,760 --> 02:37:46,500
KRIS: Let's just try a good old Eldritch Blast on this yucky knight.

3390
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:48,899
JERRY: Yeah. Let's see it. KRIS: He's a sour man.

3391
02:37:48,899 --> 02:37:50,239
KRIS: I don't like him.

3392
02:37:50,379 --> 02:37:52,099
I'm going to punish him.

3393
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:53,579
AMY: You're going to ruin my food.

3394
02:37:54,559 --> 02:37:57,279
KRIS: Ooh yeah. That's going to be a 17.

3395
02:37:57,819 --> 02:38:00,139
God, it's going to be actually it's going to be a 23.

3396
02:38:00,139 --> 02:38:01,739
So never mind that. Yes.

3397
02:38:01,739 --> 02:38:03,199
KATE: Yes. KRIS: You got a plus five.

3398
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:05,079
JERRY: Yep, yep. What? 17? Yeah that's great.

3399
02:38:05,079 --> 02:38:06,760
AMY: Do the damage. KATE: 23, I think.

3400
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:08,760
KRIS: (singing) JERRY: Oh yeah. That's very good.

3401
02:38:10,239 --> 02:38:11,739
KRIS: Ooh yes! KATE: Ooh yeah!

3402
02:38:11,739 --> 02:38:15,840
KRIS: That's going to be a-- that's ten damage to him.

3403
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:23,660
JERRY: Yeah. It's just... black-- like beyond black arcs, just perforate in three places.

3404
02:38:23,959 --> 02:38:27,539
One at the beginning. And then two more quick ones.

3405
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:29,980
His back arches and that's it for him.

3406
02:38:31,379 --> 02:38:36,019
This rogue doesn't know what the situation is here.

3407
02:38:38,319 --> 02:38:41,319
The situation for the rogue has become untenable.

3408
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:42,139
KRIS: Okay.

3409
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:44,639
KRIS: Yeah that's not doing great. KATE: Mm-mmm.

3410
02:38:44,639 --> 02:38:45,779
KRIS: It's falling apart. RYAN: Time to parley.

3411
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:47,540
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: Sure you want to keep fighting, buddy?

3412
02:38:48,159 --> 02:38:50,219
JERRY: Yeah the hands are going to go up. AMY: And yet you forget to protect the mice.

3413
02:38:50,219 --> 02:38:51,799
RYAN: I'll leave him here. JERRY: Like this. &gt;&gt; KRIS: Oh okay.

3414
02:38:53,020 --> 02:38:54,440
KRIS: Bite him -- No. (laughs)

3415
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:58,640
JERRY: It's just like, "Go. You want to go so bad, go. That's fine."

3416
02:38:59,579 --> 02:39:00,700
RYAN: All right.

3417
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:02,380
We're not here to fight.

3418
02:39:02,979 --> 02:39:04,100
Got an open door.

3419
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:07,360
RYAN: Huddle up. AMY: But I'm lusty with blood.

3420
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:08,540
RYAN: Oh yeah.

3421
02:39:09,879 --> 02:39:11,339
Well we'll have to kill Amy.

3422
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:13,719
KRIS: Well I was going to say, I think our wolf is still hungry.

3423
02:39:13,719 --> 02:39:15,619
RYAN: Yeah. (laughs) AMY: (howls)

3424
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:17,840
(laughter) JERRY: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

3425
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:21,380
This malevolent-like, head low turn toward the--

3426
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:23,120
Rogue backing up.

3427
02:39:23,299 --> 02:39:25,679
JERRY: At this point now that you have opened the door-- AMY: Bark, bark.

3428
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:27,200
JERRY: the other...

3429
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:30,319
the new challenger from upstairs...

3430
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:32,260
RYAN: Oh the naked guy. JERRY: he's watching this and...

3431
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:37,159
he realizes he has no interest in any person here.

3432
02:39:37,159 --> 02:39:38,979
Or anything that's happening.

3433
02:39:38,979 --> 02:39:41,619
And just like backs straight up through the portal.

3434
02:39:41,620 --> 02:39:42,320
KRIS: Yeah.

3435
02:39:42,319 --> 02:39:44,979
AMY: (laughing) Bye! RYAN: Yeah.

3436
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:50,639
KRIS: He doesn't even give me one of these for freedom? JERRY: So what do you got? No, no. Zero.

3437
02:39:50,639 --> 02:39:51,519
KRIS: All right. JERRY: Zero.

3438
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:55,800
JERRY: As soon as you untied him you were like, what can you do for me? Right?

3439
02:39:57,159 --> 02:40:01,440
KRIS: So this rogue's looking ragged? JERRY: Just backing up away from this giant dog.

3440
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:04,040
KRIS: Through the portal, friend.

3441
02:40:05,079 --> 02:40:07,420
AMY: Ooh. &gt;&gt; KATE: Dang. RYAN: Yeah. Coming with us.

3442
02:40:07,420 --> 02:40:08,860
AMY: (exhales) &gt;&gt; KRIS: Time to go. KATE: Ice cold.

3443
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:11,460
JERRY: I'm... I'm fine here. RYAN: Bound his hands.

3444
02:40:11,879 --> 02:40:14,420
KRIS: Mmm. I think... RYAN: No. You're not fine here.

3445
02:40:15,340 --> 02:40:16,940
KRIS: It's not healthy.

3446
02:40:17,559 --> 02:40:20,479
It was a lesson that you failed to learn.

3447
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:22,659
JERRY: (laughs) AMY: Oh my god you're doing him a mercy.

3448
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:25,600
JERRY: Ho ho!. KRIS: It's time to go through the portal.

3449
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:28,159
AMY: (laughing) This is an intervention.

3450
02:40:28,159 --> 02:40:29,459
JERRY: Let's get a persuade.

3451
02:40:31,100 --> 02:40:33,340
KRIS: That's not how I was going to do it, but okay. (laughs)

3452
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:34,399
Let's try.

3453
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:37,279
KRIS: But I should-- I'm very good at it. So let's... JERRY: Persuasion, yeah.

3454
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:39,000
KRIS: Do I got any to burn? I'm going to burn!

3455
02:40:39,420 --> 02:40:40,700
Number one on here.

3456
02:40:42,420 --> 02:40:44,159
Unnecessary!

3457
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:45,520
JERRY: What was it? A 20?

3458
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:46,979
KRIS: It's a 20 plus three.

3459
02:40:46,979 --> 02:40:47,859
KATE: Dang.

3460
02:40:48,219 --> 02:40:52,639
JERRY: It seems as though the top half of this person and the bottom half

3461
02:40:52,639 --> 02:40:56,219
are separate creatures with their own wills.

3462
02:40:56,879 --> 02:41:04,019
You can see that the legs are moving and the face is somewhat surprised by the fact.

3463
02:41:04,979 --> 02:41:06,739
So you want to pop through first?

3464
02:41:07,299 --> 02:41:09,439
RYAN: Uh... JERRY: How are you going to get him getting through?

3465
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:12,760
RYAN: Should I just-- Is he walking over towards me?

3466
02:41:13,139 --> 02:41:15,719
JERRY: Well he's walking toward the door at your direct command.

3467
02:41:15,719 --> 02:41:16,879
RYAN/KRIS: Yeah.

3468
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:18,279
RYAN: Is he like walking backwards?

3469
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:19,320
RYAN: Does he see me? KRIS: I don't know.

3470
02:41:19,319 --> 02:41:21,180
RYAN: Or is he like, oh dude! JERRY: Just like this.

3471
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:22,440
RYAN: Yeah. All right.

3472
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:23,540
KRIS: I don't care if he gets out.

3473
02:41:23,739 --> 02:41:24,979
RYAN: Uh...

3474
02:41:24,979 --> 02:41:26,600
KRIS: I want him to have a miserable life.

3475
02:41:26,600 --> 02:41:29,020
RYAN: Yeah. I'm going to grab him by the scruff of the neck just to make sure.

3476
02:41:29,020 --> 02:41:31,680
I'll be like, no, you're coming with me. And then go through.

3477
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:33,180
JERRY: Okay-- RYAN: Scruff of the haunches.

3478
02:41:33,180 --> 02:41:35,600
AMY: (laughs) The butt?

3479
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:38,380
KRIS: He's all haunch, this one. RYAN: I'm all... You and me, we're going through.

3480
02:41:38,379 --> 02:41:40,179
JERRY: When you push him through...

3481
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:42,280
you hear a...

3482
02:41:43,219 --> 02:41:44,500
The sound is not the same.

3483
02:41:44,540 --> 02:41:45,360
RYAN: Hmm.

3484
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:47,319
JERRY: There's a shriek. Do you walk through yourself?

3485
02:41:47,319 --> 02:41:48,279
RYAN: Oh wait, no. I stop.

3486
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:49,659
(laughter)

3487
02:41:49,659 --> 02:41:50,459
And I say...

3488
02:41:50,879 --> 02:41:52,559
Well he was scared of the portal.

3489
02:41:53,639 --> 02:41:57,719
Then I remember all my terror of doors and I say, who's next? (laughs)

3490
02:41:57,959 --> 02:42:01,159
RYAN: I hold the door open. As the gentleman that I am. JERRY: Go right ahead. Absolutely.

3491
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:03,060
KATE: I'm going to loot the knight.

3492
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:05,880
KATE: I want to see what the knight's got. JERRY: Oh ho ho.

3493
02:42:05,879 --> 02:42:08,239
AMY: Oh looting bodies. The other half of this game.

3494
02:42:08,239 --> 02:42:10,199
JERRY: Yeah I was going to say, loot. RYAN: Oh...

3495
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:11,220
AMY: Huh. &gt;&gt; KATE: Yeah. KRIS: Wow.

3496
02:42:11,579 --> 02:42:13,879
RYAN: Should we open all the rooms too? KATE: Rosie's nothing if not practical.

3497
02:42:13,879 --> 02:42:16,299
KRIS: We just say here for hours. Yeah it's not bad here!

3498
02:42:16,299 --> 02:42:18,979
RYAN: Yeah you see-- AMY: There are good beds!

3499
02:42:18,979 --> 02:42:19,899
RYAN: Yeah.

3500
02:42:19,899 --> 02:42:21,559
KATE: Look, just food everywhere. What?

3501
02:42:21,559 --> 02:42:23,939
JERRY: You find a small, gold pouch.

3502
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:25,079
KATE: K. RYAN: Aww.

3503
02:42:25,079 --> 02:42:29,100
JERRY: That has a chess piece and six gold pieces.

3504
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:30,819
KATE: Okay. Chest piece?

3505
02:42:30,819 --> 02:42:31,860
JERRY: Chess piece. KRIS: Chess piece.

3506
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:34,340
KATE: Chess piece. AMY: And you say, checkmate, motherfucker.

3507
02:42:34,340 --> 02:42:36,239
JERRY: A rook. &gt;&gt; KATE: A rook? RYAN: Well I wanted to-- yeah.

3508
02:42:36,379 --> 02:42:37,920
RYAN: And I say, that's a good idea.

3509
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:39,460
KATE: But we squished the wizard. So...

3510
02:42:39,459 --> 02:42:41,239
AMY: We liquified it. RYAN: We, well...

3511
02:42:41,239 --> 02:42:44,920
RYAN: We, as a-- or in another way, I. JERRY: The things that the wizard has--

3512
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:46,600
JERRY: had probably seen better days.

3513
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:48,440
AMY: I want to go through the portal.

3514
02:42:48,440 --> 02:42:49,780
RYAN: I dig through the dead squirrels.

3515
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:51,060
KRIS: So we failed the test. AMY: I want to dog through the portal.

3516
02:42:51,059 --> 02:42:53,159
JERRY: So you dog through the portal.

3517
02:42:53,399 --> 02:42:56,199
You pass through. You see...

3518
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:57,740
Have you passed through as well or are you waiting?

3519
02:42:58,120 --> 02:43:01,060
RYAN: Oh I'm going to wait like we do. Knock when you're through.

3520
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:03,420
KRIS: Yeah, I'm going through. RYAN: Could be a portal of annihilation.

3521
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:04,579
AMY: I go through and-- (howls) JERRY: So you go through? &gt;&gt; KATE: Sure.

3522
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:08,500
JERRY: You go through. You go through. You have led this person through.

3523
02:43:08,799 --> 02:43:13,939
You can see an idyllic sort of forest road.

3524
02:43:13,940 --> 02:43:17,460
AMY: (inhales) Finally. JERRY: That travels through...

3525
02:43:17,459 --> 02:43:18,479
RYAN: (laughs)

3526
02:43:18,479 --> 02:43:19,799
AMY: Finally. Goodbye.

3527
02:43:19,799 --> 02:43:21,699
JERRY: It's one of those forest paths-- RYAN: Just walk away from everybody.

3528
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:25,020
JERRY: where the trees have sort of joined over the top.

3529
02:43:25,020 --> 02:43:27,620
KRIS: In holy matrimony. JERRY: You can smell the wind.

3530
02:43:27,620 --> 02:43:29,500
AMY: (smells the air) (sighs).

3531
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:30,920
JERRY: One thing... AMY: Oh.

3532
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:37,000
JERRY: One thing that is odd-- that you find odd is that your prisoner is not with you on this side.

3533
02:43:38,079 --> 02:43:40,579
And neither is K'thriss Drow'b.

3534
02:43:41,899 --> 02:43:43,340
JERRY: (claps hands) That's all we got for today.

3535
02:43:43,340 --> 02:43:45,020
RYAN: Yay. &gt;&gt; AMY: No! KATE: Oh my god.

3536
02:43:45,020 --> 02:43:46,960
JERRY: We will come back-- RYAN: Portal of annihilation.

3537
02:43:46,959 --> 02:43:51,939
JERRY: We will come back and play some more Dungeons &amp; Dragons with the "C" Team next week!

3538
02:43:51,940 --> 02:43:54,260
KRIS: Oh! RYAN: Next week. Next week.

3539
02:43:54,260 --> 02:43:55,600
AMY: With a new fourth player-- Oh sorry.

3540
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:58,819
KRIS: Bye! It's been fun. RYAN: Who will be the new player?

3541
02:43:58,819 --> 02:44:00,059
AMY: Maybe it'll be you-- (laughs) No.

3542
02:44:00,059 --> 02:44:01,719
(laughter) KRIS: You just got to switch.

3543
02:44:01,719 --> 02:44:03,340
RYAN: Maybe it'll be you!

3544
02:44:03,340 --> 02:44:04,299
(laughter)

3545
02:44:04,299 --> 02:44:06,639
KRIS: Camera one? Camera two?

3546
02:44:06,639 --> 02:44:09,039
RYAN: Yeah. Camera? You? You? KATE: You? You?

3547
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:09,980
JERRY: Exactly.

3548
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:12,219
KRIS: Well done. Well done. JERRY: But yeah, yeah. Thanks for watching everybody.
