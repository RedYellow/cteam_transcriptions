1
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,859
- Hello.

2
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:47,839
RYAN: (whispers) Oh my God!

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,680
- I'm Tycho Brahe of Penny Arcade and PAX. (players whispering and giggling)

4
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,719
Players!

5
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,679
KATE: (whispers) Sorry.

6
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,479
- Tycho Brahe of Penny Arcade and PAX.

7
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,579
I'm also Ominifis Hereward Dran of Acquisitions Incorporated.

8
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,519
(takes deep breath)

9
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,560
But today I'm Jerry Holkins

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,200
and I'm running a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons for my friends!

11
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,359
To my right!

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
Dragonborn narcissist,

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,859
Uh...

14
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,959
AMY &amp; KATE: (laughs)   RYAN: Ryan... JERRY: Whoever it is.

15
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,359
RYAN: Sure. JERRY: This dick.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,180
JERRY: No, no. His name is Donaar Blit'zen.

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,540
But he's played by Ryan Hartman.

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,000
RYAN: (claps loudly)

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,219
KRIS: Aggression!

20
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,760
JERRY: It's too much. It's too much. It's too much.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,239
Amy the Falcon.

22
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,560
Rolling in...Returning champion. AMY: (softly cheers)

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,379
KATE: (bird cries)   KRIS: (whoosh sounds) JERRY: Walnut Dankgrass.

24
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,500
AMY: Oh yeah.

25
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,100
JERRY: Recovered. Recovered.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,680
Kate Welch.

27
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:33,979
Rosie Beestinger.

28
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,700
Not your grandma's grandma.

29
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,500
Now...

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,399
Did you guys get your hair cut at the same place? There is...

31
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,619
KATE: We did. Thanks for noticing! AMY: Yeah.

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,719
JERRY: There's a commonality here. I can't pick up on it.

33
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,179
AMY: It's the glasses. JERRY: Is that what it is?

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,880
AMY: Mmm. KATE: Yeah.

35
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,299
KRIS: Oh, Warby Parker? Are those...?

36
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,480
AMY: Yeah. The very same. KATE: They are, yeah. As a matter of fact, yeah.

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,780
- Great fit. Great price.

38
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,280
(laughter) JERRY: Kris Straub!

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
Playing Underdark exile

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,880
K'thriss Drow'b.

41
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,200
Back at it again.

42
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:06,120
Just to get the viewing audience synchronized with our newest adventure.

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,659
You, very recently, had just driven south from Westbridge,

44
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:18,719
after your successful quelling of the goblin raids to the east of there.

45
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:26,159
You got embroiled in some kind of personal conflict.

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,620
Ostensibly about statues, but there's clearly something deeper

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,740
going on between these two men.

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,180
You escaped just in time, rolled south,

49
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,319
came back into Red Larch to the

50
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,099
Dran &amp; Courtier where you are stationed.

51
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,659
Currently the corporate headquarters

52
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:50,579
of the Dessarin Valley branch

53
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,320
of Acquisitions Incorporated.

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:01,620
And had an encounter with a very agitated

55
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,680
goblin named Splugoth the Returned.

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,099
Who didn't have beef.

57
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,479
Seemed authentically curious why anyone would

58
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,159
choose to represent Acquisitions Incorporated.

59
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,919
Left you with a specific warning

60
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,619
not to trust the company that you are part owners of.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,800
And 100% not to trust the CEO

62
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,600
of Acquisitions Incorporated,

63
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,340
Ominifis Hereward Dran.

64
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,800
Who is my other character!

65
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,379
So...the fucking...

66
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,259
the fucking worlds are merging.

67
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,219
KATE: What are the odds? AMY: Yeah, weird.

68
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,699
RYAN: You're playing one character telling us --

69
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,739
JERRY: One to one! RYAN: not to trust the other character you play.

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,719
JERRY: One to one. Yeah it's uh...

71
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,960
KRIS: You convinced us. though. Looked real.

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,460
RYAN: Yeah.

73
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,760
KRIS: Looked like you didn't like that other guy. RYAN: The self-hate! Yeah!

74
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,020
JERRY: Yeah, it seemed exciting.

75
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,020
Like, so...the entire campaign is just there to be for me, really,

76
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,080
at the end of the day. RYAN: I'm getting that.

77
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,579
(laughter)

78
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,179
AMY: We're all here for you, Jerry. RYAN: Yeah!

79
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,060
JERRY: Thanks, guys! KRIS: Do not trust him, however handsome!

80
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,060
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: No, no.

81
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,259
KATE: Intelligent and capable... RYAN: Yeah, in 8th grade--oh God!

82
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,199
JERRY: No, no. It's actually, it's like a reverse-intervention.

83
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,819
Like, it's never too early for me to drive four other people insane.

84
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,759
KRIS: Yeah.   KATE: (laughs) JERRY: It's a Nega-Intervention.

85
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,279
AMY: Right, "drive" them. JERRY: Exactly, but...!

86
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,800
You are back home at the Dran &amp; Courtier.

87
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,399
Your next job is... as you may recall --

88
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,519
Do you actually have it written down

89
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,919
in your notebook, Documancer? AMY:  Oh I messed up.

90
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,460
AMY: Well I mean, the first job is to get all the extensive

91
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,239
documentation for this Raiding Must Stop quest done.

92
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,180
- Indeed. There's going to be a task.

93
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,240
- Right, true. But after that we have two options. And they're very good options.

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,680
The first is to go do party security for 300 gold. JERRY: Mmhmm.

95
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,400
- Or just any old time, bring a chicken to that cat Onyx.

96
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,179
- Yeah, exactly! And that's a freebie! That's like when you have that shit...

97
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,300
AMY: That's a gimme -- RYAN: Could we just walk around the market for...?

98
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,759
KRIS: Yeah... KATE: I'd like to cast Detect Chicken.

99
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,879
JERRY: Yeah yeah, it's--but still green-- it's like still green in your quest log.

100
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,500
AMY: Oh yeah.

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,699
JERRY: It's like, "We can still get XP from this, you guys."

102
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,599
AMY: It's just any time, it's a gimme. We can bring a chicken.

103
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,640
KATE: Yeah, until it turns gray,

104
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,479
KRIS: How much time has elapsed since Splugoth told us this thing?

105
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,540
Is he still here? Cuz maybe we just like (meep boop) a chicken. Done.

106
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,680
KATE: He bounced. AMY: He bounced.

107
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,160
JERRY: No, he has bounced.

108
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,819
He and his... AMY: Entourage...

109
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:32,000
JERRY: Yeah, his two-deep entourage.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,220
KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: Cadre.

111
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,520
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. They have left.

112
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,599
And like I said, there was not...

113
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,060
it wasn't agitation in the classic sense.

114
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,620
I misspoke there.

115
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:51,259
He really does seem confused and almost curious about the group.

116
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,879
What would have caused it.

117
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,920
And maybe he's been out of the loop for a while...

118
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,939
But he could have created a lot  of problems in that instance.

119
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:07,139
And it was a choice on his part, it seemed like to just feel things out.

120
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,600
But yeah, yeah.

121
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,400
KATE: He seems to be befuddled as to why

122
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,319
anyone would want to be a part of this organization.

123
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,819
Is that correct? JERRY: That's true.

124
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,139
KATE: OK. JERRY: That's true. He said as much.

125
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,620
KATE: And he gave us a card. JERRY: He did.

126
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,600
KATE: It had the symbol that we know as the Acquisitions Incorporated logo, but...

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,680
JERRY: It's inverted. AMY: Inverted.

128
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,900
KATE: it's upside-down. OK. JERRY: Yeah it's corrupted in some way.

129
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:30,479
JERRY: And then below the hard line at the bottom just reads, "The Six."

130
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,580
KATE: The Six. Is there any familiarity that any of us would have with this organization?

131
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,000
JERRY: You are welcome to try... AMY: (whispers) You're welcome to try.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,060
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, you are welcome to try. KATE: I have History?

133
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,959
KATE: Would History do anything there?

134
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,099
JERRY: History would be a great choice for this.

135
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,120
KATE: OK. Alright.

136
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,180
Here I go!

137
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,340
I got a 7.

138
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,399
KRIS: I'm gonna be a historian too! KATE: Do it!

139
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,699
JERRY: Yeah. I'm gonna do Double History. RYAN: Should we all try?   KATE: Yeah. Everybody do it.

140
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,019
KRIS: Ooo... RYAN: I got History...

141
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:56,639
KATE: History boy over here. KRIS: How 'bout a 15? How's that feel?

142
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,319
JERRY: It's decent. KRIS: Do I know something?

143
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,980
JERRY: Let's see what we got here.

144
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,019
RYAN: 20. 18 + 2.

145
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:03,959
KRIS: Hmm.

146
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,140
KATE: Oh so Donaar's just been studying about -- RYAN: I know the best! Yeah barely.

147
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,240
KRIS: You're like,  "That guy? Oh my --" RYAN: "Oh! I know him! Awww..."

148
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,579
KATE: You wake up the next morning, you're like, "Oh yeah!"

149
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,240
RYAN: "By the way, everyone!"

150
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
JERRY: No, no. You go up. You brush your teeth,

151
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
get all your shit on, and then you come back out!

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
"Actually wait a second."

153
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,980
You are not...

154
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,740
You are not familiar with any overlap between

155
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,620
"The Six" and Acquisitions Incorporated.

156
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,639
Could be a new player on the scene...

157
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,639
There's nothing in any of the official documentation.

158
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,680
There's certain other groups

159
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,540
that are on the form that you have already. AMY: Mmhmm.

160
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,200
JERRY: It's like if you encounter...

161
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,719
the Zhentarim, there's a checkbox.

162
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,540
AMY: Sure. JERRY: Right?

163
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,720
JERRY: If you encounter the Harpers, there's a checkbox.

164
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,779
If you encounter Dran...

165
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,300
AMY: Enterprises...of course! JERRY: Enterprises, there is a checkbox.

166
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,259
AMY: There's a BIG checkbox.

167
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,099
JERRY: It's huge. In fact...it's--

168
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,279
you have to like...WORK not to check that box.

169
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,299
Its very large. AMY: Right.

170
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,660
JERRY: But that's the case.

171
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,280
If there is a specific overlap with that organization, whatever it is,

172
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,839
you're not aware of any threads that cross there. RYAN: Hmm.

173
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,399
KATE: Walnut, I assume, might have been poring through documentation overnight,

174
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,079
to try to find any mention of these folks?

175
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,500
AMY: Uh... KATE: Is that accurate?

176
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,540
AMY: Yeah, absolutely. KATE: I'm asking as Rosie, like,

177
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,840
"Have you found anything in the documentation we'd been given about The Six?"

178
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,500
AMY: Walnut's like, always wants like have the answer

179
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,360
but doesn't, is like, "Uh well. I mean --" JERRY: (laughs)

180
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,019
AMY: "I have to get back to you on that."

181
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:36,259
"But, I mean, I had to fill out the documents, and that took a long time. And also just --"

182
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,299
KATE: "I can't even imagine how long that must have taken."

183
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,039
AMY: "Yeah. A long time."

184
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,219
KATE: "You did a really good job. Thank you so much."

185
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,420
AMY: "Thank you. It's good t--Thank you."

186
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,719
"Just doing my duty."

187
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,000
KATE: (giggles)

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
KATE: OK, so the answer's no. (laughter)

189
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,039
RYAN: That's a long way of saying no. AMY: No...

190
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,360
AMY: That's kind of her thing. KRIS: That's the softest no.

191
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,879
AMY: She just doesn't wanna admit defeat.

192
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,039
JERRY: Can you imagine the gear shift for Walnut, though?

193
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,279
Coming like straight out of the woods,

194
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,480
and then right into this sort of like...

195
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,700
RYAN: Documents. KATE: Yeah.

196
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,800
KATE: Documents. KRIS: All these dead trees.

197
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,679
KATE: Yeah. RYAN: Yeah.

198
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,779
KRIS: The very thing I swore to protect. AMY: Eh...

199
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,279
KATE: Killing nature's kind of her thing.

200
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,159
JERRY: She's writing--she's just writing...

201
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,379
directly on their flattened corpses.

202
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,539
KATE &amp; KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: On their pulp.

203
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,299
AMY: "See how you like it, asshole!"

204
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:19,299
(laughter)

205
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:21,319
RYAN: The pen is just a taxidermied squirrel

206
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,520
with like a little quill coming out of the mouth.

207
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,539
KRIS: It's like, money retrieved--300 gold--uh...so sorry.

208
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,679
Uh...

209
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,659
At the end of every line, "I apologize." AMY: I will say --

210
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:32,899
AMY: I will say as a little bit, like--I would say that,

211
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,459
Walnut's definitely like, wants to act like she knows what's going on.

212
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,180
KATE: OK. JERRY: Yeah.

213
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,639
AMY: This would be kinda like... KATE: OK.

214
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,960
AMY: She's figuring it out as she goes along.

215
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
KATE: Rosie--I can tell that you're full of shit.

216
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,800
But I'm going to--I understand that you're young

217
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,319
and I wanna encourage you, so I'm like,

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,160
"You know what? You're probably right on the cusp of finding it."

219
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,000
"So definitely keep looking."

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,019
And then I'd like to bring the card over to Prophetess

221
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,100
and ask her what the shit is up with this guy.

222
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,159
Does she know anything? "Do you know --" You're Prophetess now.

223
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,500
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

224
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,279
KATE: Do you? JERRY: I know what's required of me.

225
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,379
KATE: I know what I am. Don't tell me what I am.

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,080
"So, Splugoth the Returned, The Six?"

227
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,280
"Check out this card."

228
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,259
"Seems to be our logo, upside-down."

229
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,679
"Do you know anything about this guy?"

230
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,120
"Have you heard anything like this?"

231
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,259
JERRY: She reaches out for the card.

232
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,000
KATE: I hand you the card.

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
KRIS: Roll to Hand.

234
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,399
(laughter)

235
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,579
KRIS: Nope. RYAN: You drop it. It sets on fire. Aww.

236
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,420
(laughter) JERRY: The entire inn burns down.

237
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:31,319
JERRY: She looks at the front. Looks at the back.

238
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:35,279
Looks at the front again. Sets it down.

239
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,180
Holds her holy symbol and places her hand on the card.

240
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,520
Removes her hand.

241
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,479
There's a glow that ignites and then fades on the card.

242
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,399
She says, "There's nothing special about the card."

243
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,100
"I'm not familiar with a group called The Six."

244
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,620
"Or anyone named Splugoth."

245
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,679
"Splug, I know."

246
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,500
"I'm not sure if--I don't..."

247
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,639
"There could be something about  goblin naming that I don't understand."

248
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,419
"It's not my specialty."

249
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,419
RYAN: Who's Splug? JERRY: "I only speak a little bit."

250
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,220
KATE: Do you say that in character? RYAN: "Who's Splug?" Yeah.

251
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,980
JERRY: "Oh..."

252
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,259
She (clears throat) She turns around,

253
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:21,819
grabs a glass and a rag,

254
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,160
moves back over to the front of house,

255
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,379
sits out from behind the bar with the party,

256
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:30,659
and she says,

257
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,019
"It's old. It's an old story."

258
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,039
"But there was a moment..." RYAN: (laughs)

259
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,319
JERRY: "very early in my son's career"

260
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,879
"where he had a choice"

261
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,460
"between saving his friend Binwin Bronzebottom"

262
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,940
"and rescuing a goblin."

263
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,660
"And the choice he made at that time,"

264
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,339
"was to save a dwarf of the Bronzebottom clan."

265
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,619
"It was a moment. I have seen this on the field myself."

266
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,720
"As a paladin--of course, you'd know."

267
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,779
RYAN: "Yeah."

268
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,360
JERRY: "You get into situations where you need to make a decision"

269
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,300
"in one second that you remember for the rest of your life."

270
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,220
"I know it's something that he still thinks about."

271
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:28,879
"But if he were two people and had four hands, maybe life would be different."

272
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,759
"But he only has the two."

273
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,879
RYAN: So Splug's dead?

274
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,019
AMY: No, Splugoth the Returned.

275
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,279
RYAN: No, I'm saying that in this instant, Splug died?

276
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,659
KATE: So this was... KRIS: He wasn't saved.

277
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,379
KATE: a choice between Binwin and Splug. RYAN: He wasn't saved.

278
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:42,139
KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: Yeah.

279
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
KATE: OK so Splug probably bears a grudge for this. RYAN: Verifying...

280
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
RYAN: I'm verifying he died. AMY: I'm just saying --

281
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,899
KATE: I don't know if he died. RYAN: That's what I'm asking.

282
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,699
KATE: It's an Anakin Skywalker situation. AMY: If you're gonna take a logo

283
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,540
AMY: and flip it upside-down...

284
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,299
Like that just says a lot.

285
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,779
Walnut is deeply disturbed. This is in character actually.

286
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,679
AMY: "(gasps)" JERRY: Just the iconography?

287
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,039
AMY: "Why would they do that?" KRIS: It's IP theft.

288
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,480
AMY: It is.   RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: On its face.

289
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,620
JERRY: At the end of the day, is it fair use? No. KRIS: No.   RYAN: No.

290
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,660
AMY: "Anyway and that's why I couldn't figure out who he was"

291
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,480
"because I was doing this." And she just puts a bunch of papers down.

292
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,120
She's like, "Umm..." (laughter)

293
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,340
"We have a very strong case against them."

294
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,220
KATE: You have just like your lawsuit litigations.

295
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,480
AMY: Yeah and I take the card back, "Anyway..."

296
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,560
and put it in a little Ziploc bag, like, "this is..."

297
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,799
KRIS: "I don't know if you could go wrong NOT saving a goblin."

298
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
JERRY: (snorts) KATE: Wow.

299
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,399
KRIS: "I think he chose correctly." RYAN: Wow.   KATE: Hard stance.

300
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,059
RYAN: (whistles) Jeez. Wow. JERRY: Wow he's just coming out with it.

301
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,559
AMY: Walnut takes a look around to make sure the goblin's gone.

302
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,399
RYAN: Yeah. (laughter)

303
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,100
KRIS: I don't know if you could--you don't have the right to say (whispers) "the goblin."

304
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,779
(laughter)

305
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,039
KATE: (whispers) Bitch...

306
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:44,759
JERRY: She says,

307
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,699
"I guess I could understand why,"

308
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,240
"under the circumstances"

309
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:56,519
"were he to be back on the market,"

310
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,639
"he might bear some kind of grudge."

311
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,100
"But I know Omin. And I know that he would have made the best decision he could at that time."

312
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,580
KATE: OK. JERRY: "It's always been true."

313
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,300
RYAN: "Sounds like a sweet boy."

314
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,139
KATE: "You must be very proud."

315
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,340
JERRY: "He'll do in a pinch."

316
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,700
KRIS: "Must be nice to have a mom who believes in you."

317
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,360
(laughter)

318
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,600
KRIS: I say that in here.

319
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,820
RYAN: With a single tear.

320
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,140
JERRY: I say it within. RYAN: Yeah.

321
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:22,580
JERRY: He cries from his teeth.

322
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,600
(laughter) KRIS: In the Drow fashion.

323
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,200
KATE: So this Splugoth doesn't appear to have left us --

324
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,740
he left us a calling card, but no actual way to contact him again, as far as we can tell.

325
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,039
So I guess, just like throw the card in the fire and go about our business?

326
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,480
RYAN: Yeah. On to finding a chicken.

327
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,580
AMY: This is... KATE: Sorry. It's part of the lawsuit.

328
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,440
KATE: You can hang on to it.

329
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,480
AMY: This is part of something I'm working on, please.

330
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,740
(laughter)

331
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,899
RYAN: You go into her room and there's just like this giant crazy conspiracy board.

332
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,819
With like yarn tied between pieces of paper.

333
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,120
AMY: Who is The Six?

334
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,679
JERRY: There's a picture of a chicken.

335
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,359
RYAN: Yeah. Question mark? Cat?! Question mark. KRIS: Decision man?

336
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,419
KRIS: Decisonsman. Decision  dragonsman. What's the term?

337
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,919
KRIS: You are a... AMY &amp; KATE: Decisionist.

338
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,779
RYAN: Leader. KATE: Decisionist.

339
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,539
KRIS: Baconator.

340
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,339
KATE: Eh... RYAN: Bac--baconator? (laughs)

341
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,160
KRIS: So in a case like this, would this card count as a document?

342
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,360
Or part of the hoard? Part of the treasure.

343
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,700
RYAN: Ooo...that's a good question. KATE: Oh, let's you know what?

344
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,860
KATE:  We got two and a half hours

345
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,320
let's argue about who gets to keep the business card. RYAN: Yeah...

346
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,860
RYAN: Who does get the business card?

347
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,700
RYAN: I will have to think--real time-- half hour minimum about this.

348
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,540
(laughter) RYAN: Talk amongst yourselves.

349
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:28,079
KRIS: Before we could move on. RYAN: Yeah.

350
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,680
AMY: This actually should go to you. If you're going to actually keep it.

351
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,500
It should be in the hoard. This thing.

352
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,080
RYAN: As the Decisionist, I say time to move on from talking about business cards.

353
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,220
KRIS: You don't even talk to me? RYAN: Yeah.

354
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,980
KATE: Let's do... RYAN: I just go...

355
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,060
KATE: Let's do some party security.

356
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,739
I'm feeling really buff after all this stuff.

357
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,460
I'm feeling strong. Jacked. Ripped up. Got my pump on.

358
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,540
JERRY: Shredded.   KATE: Yeah. AMY: You don't wanna attend the wedding?

359
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:51,299
KATE: No. I wanna go bounce at a party. RYAN: What wedding? What?

360
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:52,279
AMY: The chicken-cat wedding.

361
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,799
RYAN: Oh... AMY: Was that cat being

362
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,679
AMY: sarcastic? RYAN: I think the cat was fucking with you.

363
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,339
KRIS: Cats are sarcastic animals.

364
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,139
JERRY: That's the fan art I want! RYAN: Regardless,

365
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,659
JERRY: I want cats and chickens joining. RYAN: it's gonna be funny. Yeah.

366
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:03,779
JERRY: I want them becoming one.

367
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,500
KATE: Mass hysteria. AMY: Alright so, I'm like rolling up all my stuff. I'm like,

368
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,379
AMY: "Well after this we're getting a chicken!"

369
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:10,500
"A live one."

370
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,980
RYAN: I dunno. I mean, how much time do we have? So how much...?

371
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,379
RYAN: We have ten days for the security. KATE: OK so Doomsgate Inn was in ten days.

372
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:18,159
KATE: Correct? From when we started. JERRY: Yeah.

373
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,319
KATE: And how many days has it been?

374
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,760
RYAN: We've only had, like 4 nights, right? KRIS: We can do both.

375
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,319
KRIS: We go do this thing. We get a chicken while we're there --

376
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,740
RYAN: Yeah we could do a chicken while we wait, I'm saying.

377
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,700
KRIS: I'm sure the streets are lousy with them. AMY: We can pick up the chicken at the--what's the D&amp;D

378
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,840
AMY: version of Safeway? I dunno.

379
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,379
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You stop right out front a Chickens While-You-Wait.

380
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,559
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Yeah. Chickens While-You-Wait.

381
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,539
RYAN: Chicken-Mart. AMY: Right.

382
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,120
KATE: Chicken-Mart. OK. Sounds great.

383
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
AMY: Party security. RYAN: Chick-fil-B.

384
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,700
KATE: Shall we go to the Doomsgate Inn?

385
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,540
Which I certainly have a map of because I'm the Cartographer.

386
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,500
JERRY: Cartograph-Her.

387
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,939
KATE: (laughs)

388
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,480
KRIS: Nice. KATE: Yup. That's me.

389
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,899
KRIS: Sort of--sort of nice.

390
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,459
KATE: That's me. "Sort of--sort of nice!"

391
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,920
And this is--our client is "Vespertine"?

392
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,620
JERRY: Well the...

393
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,560
the official job posting, as you know, AMY: Right.

394
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,679
JERRY: is, "Party Security for the Vespertine Order" KATE: K.

395
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,299
JERRY: "300 gold pieces."

396
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,579
KATE: K and the Vespertine Order is definitely vampires.

397
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,699
Obviously, we can all agree on that.

398
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,259
JERRY: Well, here. I'll read the rest. RYAN: So we should go shopping first: garlic...

399
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:17,420
AMY: Read it, read it. KRIS: Yeah, yeah.

400
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,820
JERRY: "Sombar Blood-Drinker requests professional defense specialists"

401
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,460
AMY: Mmhmm.

402
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,980
JERRY: "for a midnight soirée." RYAN &amp; KRIS: Hmm!

403
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,400
JERRY: "Inquire at the Doomgate Inn."

404
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,140
KATE: You know what? I take it back. I don't think they're vampires.

405
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,960
(laughter)

406
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,840
AMY: Nothing would lead me to believe that that is a vampire.

407
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,019
RYAN: We got time to go shopping, regardless.

408
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,759
KATE: Wait! Why do you want to go shopping? What are we shopping for?

409
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,940
AMY: Garlic. RYAN: Wooden stakes.

410
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,920
KATE: Ah...   AMY: Wood. Stakes. RYAN: Garlic. Silver.

411
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,380
RYAN: I want to get a doll for the egg.

412
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,780
A little toy for the egg.

413
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,319
AMY &amp; KATE: (choking back laughter) RYAN: I got a whole shopping list here.

414
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,379
KRIS: I think it's pretty rude of us to assume that they want our blood.

415
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,640
Like they're just like, (bleurgh) "I gotta get blood."

416
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,840
KATE: The guy's name is Sombar Blood-Drinker. KRIS: Like they don't got choices?

417
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,140
RYAN: This is a bit we could probably do in front of him.

418
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,220
(laughter)

419
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,100
KRIS: Yeah, it might win him over.

420
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,259
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: You considered this.

421
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,799
RYAN: Who's on first? Blah blah blah.

422
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,139
KATE: You guys wanna hop in the cart? If you're done exchanging jokes?

423
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,180
KATE: Can we do some serious business here? RYAN: I wanna go buy some shit.

424
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,600
KATE: Oh you wanna go shopping. OK, right.

425
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,819
JERRY: Prophe asks you about your sash.

426
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:21,960
RYAN: "My little one? In my back?"

427
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,620
KATE: Your babybjörn? RYAN: Oh yeah. We should show her the egg.

428
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:25,819
"I found this."

429
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,639
"I found this egg. It's my egg now."

430
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,280
KATE: That's how things work.

431
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,399
RYAN: That's how things work.

432
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,060
That's how things work to Donaar.

433
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,339
AMY: Prophe...does she know about any of this?

434
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:36,939
RYAN: "You know about dragon eggs?"

435
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,800
JERRY: "A little." RYAN: Mmhmm.

436
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,619
JERRY: "Are you planning on bringing that with you on a job?"

437
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,539
- "I don't trust anyone else with it."

438
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,519
KATE: That hasn't really worked out great, though.

439
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,000
- Uh it's fine, isn't it? KATE: Well...

440
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,920
It's in pristine condition, is it not? (laughter)

441
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,740
KATE: How many times per day can you Lay on Hands?

442
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,579
RYAN: Right now. It's in pristine condition, is it not?

443
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,980
JERRY: Right now at 10 -- RYAN: I rest my case!

444
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,680
JERRY: at 10 am. RYAN: Yeah.

445
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,059
KATE: Yup. JERRY: She says,

446
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,160
JERRY: "I could take care of it."

447
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,859
RYAN: "I don't know you, lady."

448
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,859
AMY: Prophe is 1, 2, 3 times a mommy. RYAN: That's true.

449
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,419
JERRY: "How many...

450
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,680
How many children do you have?

451
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,580
RYAN: "One."

452
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,100
RYAN: I shake the egg. (laughter)

453
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,240
RYAN: "Just this one!"

454
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,759
"And I love it so much!"

455
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,859
KRIS: Listen, listen --

456
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:32,219
KATE: I'm like (hrgh!) Ready to catch that egg. Oh boy!

457
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,940
RYAN: It like cracks a little. Lay on hands.

458
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,840
KRIS: "I know...I know you're trying to get rid of the egg and kill it."

459
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,980
"But it's a bad look. Like it's not subtle the way you're going about it."

460
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,220
"We can talk about it after." (laughter)

461
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,019
RYAN: "Yeah. That's good...good advice." KRIS: "OK."

462
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,319
KRIS: "If you want advice --" RYAN: "Thanks!"

463
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,000
RYAN: "I'm sorry, I was having a conversation,"

464
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,359
"and you kinda jumped in." KRIS: "I apologize."

465
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,039
RYAN: "It's my egg!" (laughter)

466
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,799
(laughter)

467
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,379
AMY: K'thriss tried so hard... RYAN: Yeah.

468
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,500
JERRY: She says,

469
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,600
"Alright."

470
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,300
"I won't..."

471
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:09,700
"I can't make this decision for you. Every parent has to make it."

472
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,000
RYAN: "Well..." KATE: "I kinda feel like it might be safer here."

473
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,259
KATE: "Like swaddled up in a soft, little bed..."

474
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:16,619
"Plus you don't want it to get separation anxiety."

475
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,419
KRIS: "Every former parent has to make a choice like this."

476
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,320
KATE: Every "former" parent? KRIS: Yeah.

477
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,220
KATE: Every not-yet-a-parent... RYAN: Yeah!

478
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,039
RYAN: It's not real--It's not my egg! Also.

479
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,599
I've adopted it. KATE: Yeah.

480
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,199
RYAN: and I love it. AMY: That makes it your egg.

481
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,259
(laughter) JERRY: Same.

482
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:34,839
RYAN: That makes it--yeah.

483
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,539
Just like these Goodberries are my children as well.

484
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,579
KATE: And I love them. RYAN: And I love them all!

485
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,059
Everything I own, I love!

486
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,659
KRIS: (eating noises)

487
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,759
AMY: Are you gonna leave it or...? RYAN: Oh fine, I'll leave it.

488
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,839
AMY: You don't have to. KATE: I trust Prophetess.

489
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,279
Plus then it won't get squished when we inevitably push you over stuff or whatever.

490
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:53,200
RYAN: We're gonna come back and it's gonna be missing.

491
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,319
And then who do I blame?

492
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,439
AMY: I'm gonna miss the hatching... RYAN: And then who do I blame?

493
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,500
RYAN: Yeah! JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

494
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,099
KATE: If it hatches, call me! I wanna be there.

495
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,819
RYAN: Just yell out into the ether. JERRY: Exactly.

496
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:07,679
JERRY: There's obviously the fireplace in the common room by the small stage.

497
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,700
Which you have never seen anyone on yet. You make a note.

498
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,700
AMY: Yet.

499
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,220
JERRY: But there is another stove behind the bar.

500
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,579
And taking a seat cushion,

501
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:25,500
she makes a little place for the egg.... KRIS: Hmm.   Ryan: Hmm.

502
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,859
JERRY: below the coals. KRIS: Hmm.

503
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,200
RYAN: Well I say, "This will do."

504
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,680
"The egg gets fussy around 8 every night." AMY: (laughs)

505
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,080
"You gotta say 'Goodnight Moon.' You have to read 'Goodnight Moon' to the egg."

506
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:42,899
"And you have to give it not one, not two, but three kisses."

507
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,460
"Don't give the egg four kisses."

508
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,279
"For the love of God, don't give the egg four kisses."

509
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,099
KRIS: No. Don't coddle it. Ryan: No.

510
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,059
RYAN: Don't feed it after midnight. Don't get it wet.

511
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,039
(laughter) Ryan: Ummm....

512
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,740
AMY: We're like pushing him out the door and he's like --

513
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,779
KATE: I love Daddy Donaar so much.

514
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,740
KATE: Oh my -- JERRY: No, also there's another --

515
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,620
KATE: (laughs)

516
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,019
RYAN: I'm not done talking about the egg!

517
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,319
Don't make eye contact with it.

518
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,039
KRIS: You don't deserve to look at it. RYAN: Yeah.

519
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,980
KRIS: But do take care of it. (laughter)

520
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,240
KRIS: It's very important to me. RYAN: It's more important than your life...

521
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,919
AMY: Your life. Your life. Your life. RYAN: And the lives of all of you!

522
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,340
KRIS: Wear this mask of me. The body we can work on.

523
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:17,240
(laughter)

524
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,960
RYAN: Yeah I don't want it to be weird. KATE: A really crappy like paper-craft version

525
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,779
KATE: of yourself. JERRY: Yeah exactly!

526
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,899
JERRY: It's like all sort of papier-mâché.

527
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,519
KATE: Yeah. Yeah. JERRY: Comes out here...

528
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,339
KATE: Yeah, you're gonna wanna wear this mask (laughs)

529
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:29,619
RYAN: Yeah, I don't want this egg to grow up in like a weird environment.

530
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,899
So wear this mask. (laughter)

531
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,540
RYAN: And talk like me around it.

532
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:36,639
AMY: Walnut's just like walking out. (laughs)

533
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,660
KATE: Yeah you are literally pushing him out the door--yeah, yeah.

534
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,160
KATE: "Goodbye! We're off on an adventure now..." AMY: "OK we'll pick her something up on our way out..."

535
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,100
RYAN: "I'm gonna go buy her a presents."

536
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,459
KATE: "Of course. We're gonna go to a little shop, you're gonna buy her a toy."

537
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,840
RYAN: "Thank you. Finally."

538
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,439
KATE: So what kinda shops we got around this joint?

539
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,720
AMY: Paint us a picture, Shop Man.

540
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,279
JERRY: Yeah, absolutely. (clears throat)

541
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,019
So like I say...

542
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,000
Your...

543
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:59,579
the Dran &amp; Courtier is basically sort of around the corner from the main drag.

544
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,120
Across from the street the Dran &amp; Courtier is on, is of course, Waelvur's Wagons.

545
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,559
But there are multiple sundries shops...

546
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,299
Obviously we could invest some serious time there if we wanted to.

547
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,180
KATE: (stifles a laugh)

548
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:16,740
JERRY: But there are -- KATE: I'm investigating the wagons. It's fine.

549
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,900
JERRY: Yeah yeah. There are sundry--

550
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,460
There are shops where you could purchase supplies.

551
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,279
Remember this is basically --

552
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,519
Red Larch is just basically built around a section of a trade road.

553
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,319
KRIS: It's a strip mall.

554
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,240
JERRY: Yeah, basic -- AMY: Right.

555
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,839
JERRY: Yeah basically. An outlet mall.

556
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,639
Like, you want cloaks? You know what I mean? Cloaks-For-Less!

557
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,780
KATE: Chinese food...RadioShack... AMY: We call thems a "dirt mall."

558
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:39,259
JERRY: (stammers) They got a Blimpy. They don't rate Subway.

559
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,500
KATE: Naw...   RYAN: No. AMY: That's a dirt mall.

560
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,380
JERRY: You know what I mean? RYAN: They don't rate a Subway? (laughs)

561
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,260
AMY: I don't get Subway. RYAN: Sbarro.

562
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,099
AMY: Ok so what do you want -- RYAN: Three Sbarros!

563
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:49,359
KATE: We should probably... JERRY: Sbarri.

564
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,919
KATE: get some more healing potions

565
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,660
and not "healing potions."

566
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,920
Also have you made us--can you make us some Goodberries?

567
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,860
AMY: Yeah, I sure could make you Goodberries. KATE: I'm out of Goodberries. I think they all expired.

568
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:59,719
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Yeah assume everything is expired.

569
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,299
KATE: Yeah. AMY: They were expired when I gave them...

570
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,220
AMY: to...you... (laughter)

571
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,860
KRIS: Whoops. They're fine.

572
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,419
AMY: Ok so everyone would get three.

573
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,840
KATE: OK. Thank you~!

574
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,119
AMY: I get a nice little one for myself.

575
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,179
KATE: I think I'd like to pick up some healing potions.

576
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,799
KATE: You used the superior healing on Donaar

577
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,980
when he didn't kill the baby. KRIS: I did.   RYAN: He did.

578
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,720
KRIS: It's gone now. RYAN: Yeah.   KATE: OK.

579
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,500
RYAN: It's in my belly. Yum yum yum. KATE: Yeah. Potion shop?

580
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,660
KATE: Can we cruise in there?

581
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,800
JERRY: Well it's not that type of... KATE: Not that kinda town?

582
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,299
JERRY: It isn't that type of town.

583
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,399
RYAN: Is there a bakery?

584
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:29,240
KRIS: It's like a AM/PM. KATE: That's a good question.

585
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,120
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a place where one might secure a loaf.

586
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,139
RYAN: OK. KATE: Alright.

587
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,420
RYAN: Go there, we should get some food. KATE: "Yeah, you wanna get some loaves?"

588
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,779
RYAN: "I'll get some loaves." KATE: "OK."

589
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:40,259
AMY: "Why? When we have these good, good berries." KRIS: "How long of a trip is this?"

590
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:43,160
KATE: "OK. That's true. I don't know...buying --" RYAN: "They taste like shit!"

591
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,000
RYAN: "OK? They're functional, but they are disgusting."

592
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,579
"I want that on the record."

593
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:48,759
(laughter)

594
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,940
AMY: "Well you don't have to have them." KATE: "I think they're very tasty."

595
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,480
RYAN: "They're like eating poop."

596
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,839
KATE: "You know what? OK. Go buy a toy." KRIS: "It's whatever."

597
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,959
KATE: "And we're gonna get into the cart."

598
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,940
KRIS: "They're fine."   RYAN: "Alright." KATE: "You buy a toy."

599
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,759
RYAN: "Yeah. Oh and bread."

600
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,539
KATE: OK great.

601
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,059
AMY: "And some vamp garlic."

602
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,879
RYAN: Yeah we need garlic. "Hey what don't vampires like?"

603
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,840
AMY &amp; KATE: "Garlic." RYAN: "Do we know?"

604
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,620
KATE: "Garlic." RYAN: "Garlic."

605
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:11,879
KATE: "Think so. I mean, if this is--I don't know about Red Larch vampires, but..."

606
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,080
AMY: "Get one of those...

607
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,079
AMY: "things where it comes in a string." KRIS: Are we over-preparing?

608
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,980
KRIS: Like I mean they might actually be...

609
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,980
like are they the ones asking for the security?

610
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,440
KATE: Yeah, it's their party that we're going to be securing.

611
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
KRIS: So maybe we'll need that stuff RYAN: We're going to protect vampires from the...

612
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,259
KRIS: to keep other vampires out.

613
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,940
KATE: Or what does-- what are vampires afraid of?

614
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,380
RYAN: I dunno. Vampire killers?

615
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,920
KATE: Sunlight. Buffy. RYAN: People with garlic? (laughs)

616
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,420
KATE: Yeah.

617
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,680
KRIS: Bloodless men and women? AMY: Sunlight, Buffy, garlic.

618
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,180
KATE: Yeah. OK.

619
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,299
KATE: So maybe no garlic. RYAN: Can we buy sunlight?

620
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,099
KATE: Maybe they won't give us the job if we show up just reeking of garlic.

621
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:38,480
KRIS: Hmm. Yeah. JERRY: Ugh.

622
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,500
AMY: Alright fine. Then we'll go in not preparing at all.

623
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,660
KATE: Sounds great. RYAN: With our necks exposed.

624
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,560
KATE: Yeah.   AMY: (laughs) KRIS: It shows courage.

625
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,960
AMY: Mmm! Mmm... RYAN: Yeah, they'll admire that.

626
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,120
KRIS: They could sense that. You become the Alpha.

627
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,519
AMY: (sigh) My arteries are throbbing today.

628
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,559
KATE: (laughs) JERRY: Yeah exactly. I just worked out...

629
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,039
JERRY: It's...a lot of pressure...in this region.

630
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,720
AMY: Alright so Donaar picks up a toy and then we do nothing.

631
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,120
KATE: Yeah. And then we're gonna go on our way!

632
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,019
RYAN: I buy a doll. KRIS: How long of a road trip is this?

633
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,559
RYAN: I want to buy some grain.

634
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,879
KATE: We're gonna... we're hitting the road, Jack.

635
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,920
RYAN: A little bag of grain.

636
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,300
JERRY: It's about a day and a half south... AMY: Oh!   RYAN: I'm buying a bag of grain!

637
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:12,819
KATE: OK. JERRY: of...

638
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:13,919
JERRY: good road.

639
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,940
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: It's about a day and half south of here.

640
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,799
KATE: OK. RYAN: Hey I bought a bag of grain.

641
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,779
JERRY: A sack of grain? RYAN: Yeah.   AMY: Yes.

642
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,579
JERRY: In the back? Is it anti-vampire grain?

643
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,359
JERRY: Is it like... AMY: How big?

644
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,039
AMY: This big? RYAN: Just a little satchel of it.

645
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,880
KRIS: Like what kind? Triticale?

646
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,180
KRIS: Or what are you talking about? RYAN: Yeah.

647
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:30,799
(laughter) JERRY: Quinoa?

648
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,539
KRIS: Yeah. KATE: (sighs)

649
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,000
RYAN: We'll say it cost me -- KATE: I hate you guys so much right now.

650
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,779
KATE: Can we please get on with the adventure?!? JERRY: Yes. You absolutely can.

651
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:38,680
KATE: Alright. Thank you.

652
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,140
JERRY: I agree with you 100% KATE: Alright.

653
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,660
KATE: I'm gonna drive -- JERRY: We're on the same page.

654
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,519
KATE: Again. Always.

655
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,940
KATE: I'm gonna drive -- KRIS: Same arrangement right?

656
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,140
KATE: Yup. Driving.

657
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,480
AMY: Boys in the back.

658
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,579
KATE: You riding...riding the whip? AMY: I'm up on the top.

659
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:50,139
KATE: OK. Boys in the back? Here we go.

660
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,580
JERRY: Mmhmm. KATE: "Hyah! Coriander!"

661
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,639
JERRY: I have made a presumption...

662
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,740
that you have removed the heavy statue?

663
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,839
KRIS: Yes...I am aware of this... AMY: The heavy...

664
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,980
AMY: statue is...

665
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,279
KATE: The heavy statue is back at the Dran and Courtier.

666
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,519
JERRY: OK. KRIS: It's currently at the foot of the stairs.

667
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,379
KRIS: We did not put it in our like treasures, like our trophies...

668
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,020
AMY: Oh, no. That's for everyone to enjoy. KRIS: in our shelves. We're gonna have to deal with that

669
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,460
KRIS: later. KATE: Yeah, we'll deal with it later.

670
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,799
KRIS: Nice sheet over it. KATE: We get Prophetess to haul it up there for us.

671
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,200
AMY: She has to look at it the whole time. JERRY: With one hand.

672
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,299
KATE: Oh yeah. She could knock that right out.

673
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:19,220
JERRY: Absolutely.

674
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:22,899
JERRY: Absolutely. So you take to the road.

675
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,860
As your cart pulls out and you take a left at Waelvur's,

676
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:29,959
you can see --

677
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,799
which is a proprietor of lesser carts.

678
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,639
KATE: Hmm.

679
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:38,059
JERRY: Your..you know...your conveyance

680
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:41,879
definitely draws eyes from people who are in mid-purchase.

681
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,660
KATE: (laughs) JERRY: You know what I mean?

682
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,519
Like they wanna know where they can get a cart like that.

683
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,099
And they can't! KATE: Nope.   KRIS: No...

684
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,980
JERRY: Only the "C" Team has a cart of this --

685
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,160
RYAN: You have to raid three individual carts. (laughter)

686
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,060
JERRY: You have to take up a life of crime...

687
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:55,539
KRIS: There's an opening.

688
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:59,059
"Raiders" are available now. You can take the position.

689
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,559
KATE: The raiding has ceased. So... KRIS: Yeah.

690
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,379
AMY: Job well done. KATE: Raiding Must Begin Again!

691
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,720
JERRY: Exactly. There's an incredible opportunity there.

692
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,579
JERRY: So absolutely. So you roll out south.

693
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:15,440
Drive until about the end of the day.

694
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,980
Pull the cart over and rest.

695
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,319
KRIS: (sighs in relief) JERRY: Uneventful.

696
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,379
KATE: Wonderful.

697
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,620
My favorite kind.

698
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,419
JERRY: Uneventful. There were no events.

699
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,000
KRIS: None whatsoever.

700
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,839
KRIS: I just hit "A" a bunch of times.

701
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,179
JERRY: Yeah (laughs) KATE: Skipped the whole cutscene.

702
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,960
JERRY: Skip all the text. KRIS: Yeah.

703
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,599
JERRY: But yeah, yeah. You --

704
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,240
Judging from the map, you should be able to get there in plenty of time tomorrow.

705
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,039
KATE: OK.

706
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,580
KATE: So it is night right now?

707
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,919
JERRY: It is. KATE: OK.

708
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,120
JERRY: Night is upon you.

709
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:47,979
KATE: And everything seems secure?

710
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,120
We seem happy?

711
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,579
KRIS: While we're...benighted...allow me

712
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:54,720
to take care of a little business from previous. JERRY: Yeah.

713
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,299
KRIS: I never managed to do a correct Arcana check

714
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:00,000
on that crystal ball we got from one of the carts. - That's true. That's true.

715
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,079
Well done! RYAN: Oh yeah.

716
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,039
- So let me do--let me try again...

717
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,339
This thing vexes me!

718
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:06,079
(die clatters)

719
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:08,480
Hmmm...

720
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,539
What's my--what's my... JERRY: Arcana?

721
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,079
- modifier. Yeah. That's a 13.

722
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,599
That's not gonna do anything again. - No.

723
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,079
JERRY: One of these days, you're gonna -- KRIS: "What a mystery!"

724
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,500
- you're gonna do it (laughs)

725
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,219
- It's the thing I wanted...forever!

726
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,259
It's the end of the season, that's when I figure it out.

727
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,359
- And you literally have it. You have it in the thing --

728
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,259
You're staring at it for a long time

729
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:27,259
and then you realize that it's just like your own reflection.

730
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:27,960
(startled sound)

731
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,480
- (kissing sounds)

732
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,759
- You're terrified by it.

733
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,879
- Alright. We'll leave that for another day.

734
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,820
- I am hanging out next to what I presume is the fire that Walnut has built for us.

735
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,599
KATE: Because she has Survival. AMY: Of course.

736
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,079
JERRY: Mmhmm. KATE: And I am...

737
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,620
I am telling her a story about a constellation,

738
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,419
that I may or may not have made up,

739
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,740
straight up above us. AMY: So what's it called?

740
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,299
KATE: It's called the Soup Ladle.

741
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,759
AMY: Soup ladle... KATE: Yeah.   JERRY: (laughs)

742
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,859
KATE: It is--it's the Soup Ladle constellation.

743
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,139
It's--It has a whole mythology around it that I won't bore you with.

744
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,160
AMY: Oh. Well... KATE: Except...

745
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,680
KATE: I totally will. And I do.

746
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,340
AMY: OK.   JERRY: (laughs) KATE: I bore you to tears.

747
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,599
I tell you about this constellation. But you...

748
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,440
You are so fascinated by me. (laughs)

749
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,180
JERRY: Coriander does whatever you assume the horse-equivalent of a sigh is.

750
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,100
KATE: Yeah. It's just a sigh, probably.

751
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,419
KRIS: I become -- KATE: (sighs like a horse)

752
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,800
KRIS: very interested in this,

753
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,899
because we had these, you know, in the Underdark,

754
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,940
but for stalactites.

755
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,019
KATE: Really? KRIS: Yeah.

756
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,779
KATE: What? KRIS: Where we would name

757
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,740
KRIS: certain configurations... JERRY: Get out of town!

758
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,900
KATE: No, that's super cool. Don't joke. That's awesome.

759
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,780
KRIS: Yeah. We had the Pointy One.

760
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:35,960
KATE: Uh huh. KRIS: The Pointier One.

761
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,299
- Yeah. The Smoother One.

762
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:39,559
KRIS: The Small Pointy Ones Near Each Other. KATE: Yeah.

763
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:42,119
KRIS "The Sisters," we call them. KATE: Ah yes. Yeah.   RYAN: (laughs)

764
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,979
KRIS: Yeah. KATE: Yeah. That's beautiful. I had no idea.

765
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,819
- They fell down. A lot.

766
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,619
KATE: Yeah. Well these do too. KRIS: But they always been the most beautiful.

767
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:50,359
KRIS: Really? KATE: Yeah. All the time.

768
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,539
KRIS: (shudders) KATE: Yeah, that's disgusting.

769
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,899
- Yeah that's uncomfortable.

770
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,920
KATE: Yeah. KRIS: I don't like that.

771
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,840
- That's a long way to fall.

772
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:04,359
- So he is relating this tale of the Underdark constellation-equivalent.

773
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,819
You think it is NOT as good

774
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:09,579
(laughter) but it is probably fine for them.

775
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,059
- A lot of artful languages like,

776
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:15,220
like from our distance you can see a silhouette, and I'm like going,

777
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,779
"It's big and pointy like this tall! Really pointy." KATE: (laughs)

778
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:21,779
"And this one was wide! But then not so much pointy." KATE: (laughs)

779
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,000
KRIS: "This pointy!" JERRY: Bulbous!

780
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,960
AMY: Walnut was listening to Rosie because she's like,

781
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,039
"Oh yeah, I have to respect her. Cuz, you know, she's...you know, a grandmother."

782
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,460
But, you know, as soon as K'thriss starts talking,

783
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,120
Walnut's just like...

784
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,139
"FUCK!!!" KATE: (laughs)

785
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,560
JERRY: But as you're relating this...

786
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:41,019
these tales to Walnut,

787
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,559
and you're looking up, you're talking about the Soup Ladle,

788
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,279
and it's just a game.

789
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,099
It could have been a game that you played with your father.

790
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:49,399
KATE: Mmhmm. JERRY: Just making up...

791
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,620
just creating sort of mnemonics for --

792
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:55,299
you know, ways to sort of rein in the stars and understand them.

793
00:31:56,019 --> 00:32:01,200
And your eye just sort of passes over-- idly over the Homeward Star,

794
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,000
and it is unlike you remember it.

795
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:06,539
AMY: Uh oh.

796
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,539
So you might have recalled...

797
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,859
At this point it's difficult to hear anything else.

798
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:17,059
You can recall when you were in the Test Market,

799
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:22,879
Acquisitions Incorporated's clearly broken test facility,

800
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,880
there was always a guttering star at the tip --

801
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,340
and that matches the real...

802
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:29,579
that matches the true...

803
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,460
constellation. KATE: Mmhmm.

804
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,579
JERRY: There's always a blink and a twinkle at the end.

805
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:38,099
That star is completely missing.

806
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,160
KATE: Hmm.

807
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,200
JERRY: In the sky.

808
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,319
KATE: Unprecedented.

809
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:46,039
JERRY: This is not a thing that happens. KATE: OK.

810
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,240
JERRY: And what's more, the next star in...

811
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,980
it forms a sort of a...

812
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,019
like a crossbow-shape almost.

813
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,119
Where It goes flat and then sort of curves out like this.

814
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,699
The tip is now gone.

815
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,920
And the star that makes the next part of the crossbow itself...

816
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,759
is ruby red.

817
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,200
KATE: OK.

818
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:11,940
- So in the course of telling this constellation story

819
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,340
and listening very politely to the Drow

820
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,399
who wants to tell me about the pointy rocks,

821
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,780
KATE: I start... JERRY: Which are the best!

822
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,500
KATE: The best pointy rocks. KRIS: They're more of them than you think.

823
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,160
(laughter)

824
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,860
- I know they say there a lot of stars but...

825
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,240
- We have quite a few selection in the Underdark.

826
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,539
JERRY: Come a little closer and take a seat.

827
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:32,819
KRIS: Yeah. (laughter)

828
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,460
KRIS: Get comfortable. KATE: OK.

829
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,620
- So I start to point and to tell Walnut about the Homeward Star...

830
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,900
story that I have, but then I notice this abberation

831
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,540
and it spooks the hell out of me.

832
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:49,159
JERRY: Yeah it's broken. Like it's broken. KATE: I've lived...

833
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,980
KATE: here on this plane of existence for 120 years,

834
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,500
that star has never been this way.

835
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,119
JERRY: No it's for...this is how you know how to get home.

836
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,179
KATE: Yeah, so now it's just gone.

837
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,880
And so, without explaining, you guys have no idea why,

838
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,840
but I just start to kind of freak out.

839
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,119
Because I realize, inside, I don't know how to get home anymore.

840
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,699
And that's been the one thing, that no matter --

841
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,460
whether I was at the monastery or I was back in

842
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,000
in Hundred Years Lake or wherever I was living.

843
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,519
I always knew how to get exactly where I was --

844
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,559
how to get home from where I was, anywhere.

845
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,519
And I can't, so I'm just kinda losing my shit a little bit right now.

846
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,220
KRIS: Do you relate this to us, or are you gonna keep it private?

847
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:34,920
KATE: It's kinda li--I don't know if I can explain to you guys what the significance of it is

848
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,220
because I don't know if you guys care about the stars as much as I do.

849
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,939
RYAN: Nope. (laughter)

850
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,480
KATE: Don't care about this exposition, at all. RYAN: Not even a little bit.

851
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,219
(laughter)

852
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,339
AMY: I think Walnut would use it for navigation purposes because if you're

853
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,140
JERRY: Survival! AMY: out in the woods. Yes like survival stuff.

854
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,139
KATE: So maybe--can I...? Like -- AMY: Yes.

855
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,019
AMY: Can I roll a Survival check to see if I know about this or something like that?

856
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,719
JERRY: What--If... KRIS: Yeah what would the...

857
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,599
AMY: It was a 19, with a +5. So like 24.

858
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,759
KATE: So I'm just gonna--I will just point straight up into the sky wordlessly.

859
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,960
AMY: (laughs) RYAN: (startled sound)

860
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,480
KATE: I'd just look at you and be like, "Does anything..."

861
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,079
JERRY: Oh like not to lead? KATE: Right.

862
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,739
KATE: "Anything look weird?"

863
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,739
AMY: Would I know anything with a 24?

864
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,679
JERRY: Oh absolutely.

865
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,480
AMY: Oh OK. JERRY: Homeward Star, again,

866
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,420
it's not...It's not like the first choice.

867
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,960
AMY: Right. JERRY: There's a cultural aspect to it.

868
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,940
AMY: Sure, sure, sure. I figured.

869
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,579
JERRY: This is going to be the one that you use...

870
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,940
this is like, "Always. This is the way."

871
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:27,299
And then basically the second tier,

872
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,880
sort of the insider...survival...mysticism...Right?

873
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,340
There's this other tier of meaningful constellations.

874
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,420
And it's busted.

875
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,659
The front half of it,

876
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:42,679
the part that everything else is pointing toward,

877
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:45,980
is...the tip of it is gone

878
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,599
and then the color has been altered farther up. KRIS: I see --   RYAN: Mazel Tov.

879
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,639
KRIS: I see you kind of gibbering and pointing... KATE: Mmhmm.

880
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,779
JERRY: (chuckles) RYAN: Get it?

881
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,840
KRIS: And then I go, "Oh, no, no!"

882
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,920
"They don't fall down that often down there." KATE: (laughs)

883
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,880
KRIS: "They're actually really, incredibly sturdy."

884
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,059
JERRY: They're so sturdy! KRIS: "There are rocks that are..."

885
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,960
KRIS: they've been there for thousands of years. RYAN: Homeward Star...there's three of them.

886
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,840
KATE: I ca-- RYAN: One's voiced by Michael J. Fox...

887
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,720
KATE: I cast you this exact look.

888
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,980
KRIS: And I go...

889
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:13,860
KATE: (laughs) KRIS: Like I've provided comfort.

890
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,559
AMY: I want to go up to Rosie and I'm gonna be like,

891
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:19,079
"I know that that's wrong." KATE: "Yeah."

892
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,960
AMY: "But there's nothing we could do from down here."

893
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,159
"And it's just another thing wrong with this world."

894
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:26,879
KATE: Hmm...

895
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,800
(stammers) If...

896
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,840
This is to me an indication that we are not

897
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,420
in the same plane of existence  that I've always lived in.

898
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,980
So my sanity might be splintering a little bit?

899
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,519
Just...just a touch.

900
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:42,019
Like imagine you looking up and just like Jupiter is gone.

901
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,000
That's how Rosie's freaking out right now.

902
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,039
AMY: Hmm.   KATE: Yeah. RYAN. Hmm.   KRIS: Hmm.

903
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,579
KATE: OK. So... KRIS: I'm gonna choose to treat it as good news.

904
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,840
(laughter)

905
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,100
KRIS: I'm gonna keep an open mind about it. RYAN: So the inn didn't deposit us in the right reality?

906
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:55,299
KATE: Some day...Yeah.

907
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,760
Maybe like the parallel universes got shifted or something.

908
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,320
I don't know, but I'm shaken by it,

909
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,840
and I'm gonna just try to go sit by myself and go to sleep.

910
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,660
AMY: OK.

911
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,280
KRIS: I go to bed as well, with a little whistle on my lips.

912
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,200
RYAN: Yeah. (laughter)

913
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,460
KRIS: On the right track, is what I think.

914
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,679
KATE: Everything is going great. JERRY: It just feels good. It feels good.

915
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,480
JERRY: So real quick; before you guys break camp,

916
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,760
I just wanna make sure everybody knows what their abilities do

917
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:31,280
and that the Shadow Council in the chatroom

918
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,720
can modify rolls and grant cool abilities to players.

919
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,659
Donaar has used to great effect his Draconic Entitlement.

920
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,779
Where your upbringing and status allow you to intimidate foes

921
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,380
and establish your place in the pecking order.

922
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,760
It also seems to lead into a performance art thing?

923
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,320
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: At the table which obviously I endorse.

924
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,480
Grandmamancy allows Rosie to exert the Grandma Force.

925
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,440
She can disappear in plain sight and manipulate people.

926
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:04,519
The Tentacular Spectacular has also been very enjoyable.

927
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,659
A tendril of maddening chaos-stuff erupts.

928
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,099
You then try to control it with your Arcana skill. KRIS: Can't.

929
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,199
(laughter) AMY: Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

930
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,599
KATE: Can't do it. RYAN: Can't stop. Won't stop.

931
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:17,059
JERRY: And then we have Forest Friends obviously, as well.

932
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,619
AMY: Hmm. Or as I like to call it, The Small Animal Blender.

933
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,400
KATE: (laughs) JERRY: Exactly. Exactly. Snacks!

934
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,380
JERRY: Snacks. AMY: Snacks.

935
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,340
AMY: Snack Attack.

936
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,720
JERRY: But the--yeah yeah, just wanted to make sure that everybody knows

937
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,259
players and Shadow Council that those things are available to mess around with.

938
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,240
AMY: I'm ready. KATE: Cool.

939
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,079
KATE: Cool beans. JERRY: Mmhmm.

940
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,019
KATE: OK. KRIS: Let's mess with them.

941
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:37,860
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Alright.

942
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,660
KRIS: OK so we break camp. Get underway. KATE: Yup. Get back on that cart.

943
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:42,579
JERRY: Yeah.

944
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:46,039
RYAN: I toss and turn during sleep cuz I miss my egg.

945
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:46,940
(laughter)

946
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,139
KRIS: Bad night. RYAN: Yeah, I had a bad night.

947
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:51,839
JERRY: Tell us about the dream that you have.

948
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,480
RYAN: It was like--there was like a carton.

949
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,779
And then I open it, and there's no eggs in it.

950
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:58,519
And I get really upset.

951
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,599
(laughter)

952
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,699
RYAN: And I go, "What does it mean?!" (laughter)

953
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:03,319
"We gotta--Guys, we should probably go back."

954
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,160
"I got a bad feeling about little Eggy."

955
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,159
JERRY: You love the eggs. RYAN: Little Eggo.

956
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,539
JERRY: The Eggzors? RYAN: Yeah.

957
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,159
RYAN: I'm like, "How much do we really know about her?"

958
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,859
"Do we think she's gonna be OK with that egg?"

959
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,260
KRIS: What if she misplaces it? RYAN: Yeah.

960
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,700
KRIS: She goes into the stuff she cooks with. RYAN: "Did I tell her to kiss it three times?"

961
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:18,639
RYAN: "I can't remember."

962
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,139
JERRY: How many times? RYAN: How many times...

963
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:21,719
JERRY: Was it two? RYAN: "Let's go back."

964
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,219
(laughter)

965
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:25,159
KATE: I don't go back. RYAN: Let's stop being adventurers.

966
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,899
KATE: No...I go forward. JERRY: Yeah.

967
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,579
RYAN: Let's talk about stars more. JERRY: Exactly.

968
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:32,739
RYAN: No? OK. (laughs)   AMY: (laughs) KRIS: Cuz that matters.

969
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:35,439
KRIS: While my child is out there. RYAN: Yeah. Dying!

970
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,039
KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: I mean, I don't know.

971
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,300
JERRY: From insufficient kisses. It's a disease.

972
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,219
JERRY: Anyway, morning breaks.

973
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,360
Coriander is ready to roll.

974
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,280
KATE: Alright. AMY: As much as Coriander is ever ready to roll.

975
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,620
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter)

976
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:53,420
JERRY: Ready adjacent.

977
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,680
KATE: Alright. You all ready?

978
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,500
JERRY: Mmhmm.   AMY: Positions. KATE: Let's move out.

979
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,500
JERRY: Yeah, indeed. So...

980
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,860
Classic scenario:

981
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,500
You're driving up on the cart.

982
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,900
You're on top the craft.

983
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,800
AMY: Walnut's a top. JERRY: Right (laughs)

984
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,080
KATE: She so is.

985
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:13,579
JERRY: And boys are in the back?

986
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,380
RYAN: Mmhmm. KRIS: In town.

987
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,180
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. JERRY &amp; RYAN: (laughs)

988
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:17,339
KATE: The boys are in the back in town?

989
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,980
AMY: ♫ The boys are in the back in town ♫ KRIS: That was before the A&amp;R guy

990
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,460
KRIS: told them to edit it down a little bit. RYAN: Yeah. (laughs)

991
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,159
JERRY: ♫ Boys are in the back in town! ♫

992
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,399
(laughter)

993
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,460
KRIS: I think it flows better! No, no. Change it.

994
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,820
JERRY: No, no. RYAN: This used to be about the music, man!

995
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,559
(laughter)

996
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,679
JERRY: This is for my art!

997
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,839
JERRY: So you get back on the main road.

998
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,280
Pass the occasional cart.

999
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,059
It's not really the...

1000
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,560
Still Spring. Still a bit mucky.

1001
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,360
It isn't the time that the real heavy trade starts to go back and forth.

1002
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,039
So it's a pretty...it's a pretty easy ride.

1003
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,599
Occasionally you gotta get out and push Donaar,

1004
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,839
but for the most part it's fine.

1005
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:59,459
You reached the point that you have marked

1006
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,579
on the map for the Doomgate Inn.

1007
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,960
The Doomgate Inn is a bit off the Long Road. KRIS: Hmm.

1008
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,519
JERRY: It's not really part of a town. It's just sort of a way house.

1009
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,740
Another place to stop, you know,

1010
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:20,979
that never had the additional support

1011
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,559
to grow into something like a Red Larch.

1012
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,779
Who knows why.

1013
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,020
Who knows what it is about this...

1014
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,740
damned place.

1015
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:36,279
Well as you come up upon the road that leads up,

1016
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,760
sun beginning to dip past the hills,

1017
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,400
you can see a couple reasons why

1018
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,160
a town did not flourish around this inn.

1019
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:55,179
The first is the torches

1020
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,740
topped with green flame.

1021
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:00,479
AMY: (sucks in breath) Sorry. (laughter)

1022
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,780
AMY: It's instinctual. (laughs)

1023
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,400
JERRY: It was--it was for you, Walnut. It was for you.

1024
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,380
AMY: I can like feel the energy of chat right now.

1025
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,760
JERRY: Exactly. Torches... there is an emote for this.

1026
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,779
Torches that line a path,

1027
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,180
that winds up sorta between

1028
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:18,159
two hills that come together.

1029
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:21,879
And just there in the middle distance you see something that looks like...

1030
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,039
an evil cake!

1031
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,719
RYAN: Hmm. JERRY: It is stacked up tall...

1032
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,199
It would be a rich, chocolate cake.

1033
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,480
The red velvet of the interior curtains...

1034
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,699
maybe those are the cherry. Maybe it's German chocolate?

1035
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:38,799
KRIS: Wow. RYAN: Oh that is evil.

1036
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,160
JERRY: You know what I mean? KRIS: "What an inn!"

1037
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,700
JERRY: Exactly.

1038
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,299
But there is a...

1039
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,820
there's actually a...

1040
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:54,980
iron gate down, that separates this path from the main road up.

1041
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,219
And there is a wrought sign to the left of it that says,

1042
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:00,959
"The Doomgate Inn"

1043
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:05,519
"Accepting Visitors Every Sundown"

1044
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,440
KRIS: Hmm. OK. RYAN: Ah...

1045
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:09,819
AMY: Yeah. RYAN: Some Dusk til Dawn...

1046
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,800
AMY: Not vampires... RYAN: Yeah.

1047
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,440
KATE: That's what it says underneath... JERRY: There's a tiny sign attached --

1048
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,240
JERRY: No. There is no tiny sign attached. RYAN: Oh.   AMY: OK.

1049
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,419
KRIS: No, it's like the No Vacancy, but it says,

1050
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,079
"Vampires" and "Not" is lit.

1051
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,139
RYAN: Oh! (whew) KRIS: So it's ok.

1052
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:22,900
JERRY: Sometimes!

1053
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,340
AMY: Sometimes it is vampires. And that's OK. RYAN: While the sun's up, it says "Not."

1054
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,880
KRIS: You let me know when that sign goes off, and we'll get out of here.

1055
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,660
JERRY: Exactly.

1056
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,780
But the sun's final rays

1057
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,519
are shooting past the house

1058
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,539
and down through these hills.

1059
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,000
And then the moment

1060
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:43,319
it dips past,

1061
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,519
there is a click

1062
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,599
inside the gate.

1063
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,860
and it creaks open.

1064
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,340
AMY: Hmm.

1065
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,460
KRIS: Just in time.

1066
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,099
JERRY: (extended creak sound) RYAN: Yeah.   KRIS: (whimpers)   KATE: Thank you.

1067
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:55,759
RYAN: It's like I'm there.

1068
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,960
JERRY: (laughs) KATE: I feel transported.

1069
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,639
KATE: Are you into vampires? Like as a darkness boy?

1070
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,759
AMY: They never die.

1071
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,860
KRIS: I mean I'm into it as --

1072
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,700
like that part is troubling...

1073
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:09,639
but this atmosphere is welcoming to me. JERRY: (laughs)   AMY: I don't like it.

1074
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:11,460
KATE: Mmhmm. KRIS: And they obviously, you know,

1075
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,440
done the best they can with what they got.

1076
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,159
If I had to live forever I guess I'd probably be...

1077
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,480
Try to arrange my surroundings...comparably.

1078
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,719
KATE: OK. KRIS: So I'm interested to spend

1079
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:25,579
KRIS: some time around them. KATE: Yeah? You're vibing this place?

1080
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,340
JERRY: Yeah so he doesn't want to yuck their yum.

1081
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,720
JERRY: I mean it's basically it, right? RYAN &amp; KRIS: Yeah.

1082
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,279
AMY: I was just gonna say, like they're one brand of mall goth, and you're like another brand... (laughs)

1083
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,240
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1084
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,219
JERRY: It's like this--No, it's like the goth and then it's like the steampunk goth...

1085
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:38,459
RYAN: Yeah.   KRIS: Right.   AMY: Oh no... JERRY: It's like...

1086
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,679
JERRY: I can see it from here, right? But it's not my culture...

1087
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,619
KRIS: Is it like...is there like the...

1088
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,739
the decor like...like gothic?

1089
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:47,639
Or is it like a--sort of that beautiful...

1090
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:49,179
KRIS: like uh... AMY: Opulent.

1091
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,480
KRIS: androgynous kind of...

1092
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,719
like that...the sexual vampire from True Blood.

1093
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,159
AMY: Oh yeah. JERRY: Right now it's honestly a little try-hard.

1094
00:44:58,519 --> 00:44:59,940
PARTY: Oh...

1095
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,440
KATE: Really? JERRY: Yeah.

1096
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,220
RYAN: Hmm. KRIS: OK.

1097
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:04,279
KATE: So they over--it's ostentatiously gothic? JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

1098
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,000
JERRY: This is what gives it the "baked good" vibe.

1099
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:09,859
PARTY: Mmhmm.

1100
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,260
JERRY: It's a little too round... KRIS: Yeah.

1101
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,620
JERRY: at some of the edges.

1102
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,059
AMY: OK.   KATE: Too round... JERRY: Yeah...

1103
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:18,059
JERRY: It's a little too Safeway cake.

1104
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:20,380
KRIS: Right. Like Hostess Vampires. KATE: Ugh.   RYAN: Hmm.

1105
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,579
AMY: Whoa, whoa. whoa. Don't drag the good name of Hostess

1106
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:24,079
(laughter) AMY: into this vampire business.

1107
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,079
KRIS: Sorry.

1108
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:28,500
KATE: OK.   KRIS: OK. AMY: Well. Let's go on up.

1109
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,280
JERRY: Yeah exactly, it's vampire cake house

1110
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,940
as done by Little Debbie.

1111
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,500
KRIS: I'm excited on the approach,

1112
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,659
and as we get close to filling some of those details,

1113
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:37,779
I just (scoffs)

1114
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:39,359
JERRY: (laughs) Exactly!

1115
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,800
KATE: Excitement drains out of you? KRIS: "Great..."

1116
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,300
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: Yeah.

1117
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,600
JERRY: Each time you pass one of the torches, just a gout of green flame...

1118
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:48,960
just hungrily...leaps!

1119
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,840
KRIS: OK. RYAN: Ooo.

1120
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,400
KATE: I double-check the map -- RYAN: I say, "That's cool."

1121
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,400
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: but this definitely is the right Doomgate Inn?

1122
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,800
JERRY: (stutters)

1123
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,680
JERRY: It could be a franchise for all you know. KATE: Sure.

1124
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:03,739
JERRY: I mean this might be an experience they try to deliver all over Faerûn, for all you know.

1125
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:05,859
KRIS: I look at you and I go like this...

1126
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,480
which is the Drow jerk off motion.

1127
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,219
(laughter)

1128
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:10,079
AMY: This? JERRY: Which is this right here?

1129
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,159
KATE: Yeah, that makes sense to me. RYAN: I go,

1130
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,420
RYAN: "I'm full, no thank you."

1131
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,720
KATE: I'm full. Trying to quit. RYAN: Yeah.

1132
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:17,679
RYAN: "I...I already ate. I'm good."

1133
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:19,679
(laughter)

1134
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:21,219
RYAN: I don't know what you're offering. I'm just like "Neh."

1135
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,800
RYAN: "Pass."

1136
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,880
KRIS: You're not really listening either. RYAN: Yeah.

1137
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,320
KRIS: "Yeah OK, no." RYAN: "Nope."

1138
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,980
RYAN: "Look at these torches. These torches are cool."

1139
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,400
"Did you see what color they are?" KRIS: (sadly) "Yeah..."

1140
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,260
JERRY: You make a note of that at all? RYAN: Yeah!

1141
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,060
KRIS: (sadly) "Yeah..."

1142
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,699
JERRY: Absolutely. Well -- RYAN: "Look at the flame."

1143
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:37,239
JERRY: Indeed. So as you...

1144
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:43,900
as you approach the Doomgate Inn proper,

1145
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:59,640
a very pale, sort of disaffected entity of wholly ambiguous gender...

1146
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,940
AMY: Just the way I like them. JERRY: opens the door.

1147
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:04,099
KATE: Tight.

1148
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,980
JERRY: And then slowly ushers you in.

1149
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:10,599
KRIS: Hmm.

1150
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:15,360
AMY: As we're on our way in I say, "We are here to see the Vespertine Order."

1151
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:21,799
JERRY: The bellperson... AMY: Mmhmm?

1152
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,900
JERRY: closes their eyes and nods gently.

1153
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,000
AMY: Mmm. RYAN: Hmm

1154
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,639
JERRY: It's exhaustion. Mono. I mean you don't know.

1155
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:30,639
AMY: (laughs) Oh? Mono?

1156
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,619
AMY: I got, "Uh...could you take us...to..."

1157
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,460
and I hold up the missive.

1158
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:38,340
and I go, "We're here."

1159
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:42,400
"Obviously, you know who we're with. K?"

1160
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,079
JERRY: The brand speaks for itself. AMY: Yeah.

1161
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,500
- I'm pointing to the thing and I point to my own...

1162
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,739
AMY: my own little badge. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

1163
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,199
JERRY: Your Documancer's seal? AMY: My Documancer's seal.

1164
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,079
- And I say, "We need to be taken to...you know,"

1165
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,299
"whom we're here to help."

1166
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,560
JERRY: Right. AMY: "The Vespertine Order."

1167
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,579
- Eyes closed,

1168
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:00,079
deep nod...

1169
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,280
- "Away to me, pig."

1170
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,400
(laughter) RYAN: "Uh yeah. Hurry up there, Lurch."

1171
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,539
- The door is open and you can see that there are other people inside.

1172
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:13,639
- Mmm OK.

1173
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,400
- Also pale. Also exhausted.

1174
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,559
AMY &amp; RYAN: Hmm.

1175
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,539
AMY: Hungry for human blood... JERRY: Milling about...

1176
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:22,219
- Yeah! A dark thirst.

1177
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:23,799
JERRY: You have no idea about the thirst. AMY: OK.

1178
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,380
JERRY: You don't don't want to assume. AMY: They're thirsty but we don't know what kind.

1179
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,140
JERRY: (laughs) RYAN: Yeah.

1180
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:30,079
- You don't wanna--They're parched. They need electrolytes.

1181
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,840
KATE: Our boy's named... Surbin...Blood-Drinker?

1182
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,360
Is that correct? Is it Sermin--Sermin?

1183
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,860
JERRY: You're looking at the document itself? AMY: Yeah!

1184
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,740
JERRY: Sombar Blood-Drinker. AMY, KATE, &amp; RYAN: Sombar.

1185
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:43,859
KRIS: Hmm.

1186
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,820
RYAN: ♫ They call me Sombar! ♫"

1187
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,480
KATE: K.

1188
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,340
KRIS: You know, it is a vampire name.

1189
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:53,379
JERRY: (laughs) Actually you know, looking around... AMY: Now!

1190
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:55,159
AMY: Now. JERRY: Hey.

1191
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:57,719
KRIS: I know, but I mean, could be by marriage or something...

1192
00:48:57,719 --> 00:48:59,019
AMY: That's true. KRIS: It could be a vampire name.

1193
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,159
KATE: Like you're surrounded by all these like pale, hungry looking things;

1194
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:04,500
you're like, "You know what? Could be vampire." RYAN &amp; KRIS: Yeah.

1195
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,440
AMY: Huh. RYAN: "You know what? Second thought:

1196
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,539
should have bought that garlic."

1197
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:08,779
(laughter)

1198
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,980
JERRY: Lots of it. RYAN: Yeah.

1199
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,079
JERRY: Organic. You want those fragile oils.

1200
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,460
RYAN: (nervous noise) JERRY: You know what I mean?

1201
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,780
AMY: Alright so do we see anyone that looks likes they could be, you know, top pale...

1202
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,240
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. AMY: close-to-human person?

1203
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:24,539
JERRY: You see various modes of dress.

1204
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:27,699
And you can sort of find--you can find among them

1205
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:31,039
the person most likely to be a concierge...

1206
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,639
AMY: OK great. JERRY: class!

1207
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,739
JERRY: I've written up all the concierge class notes... RYAN: Hmm!

1208
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,579
JERRY: Obviously if you would like to create a concierge...

1209
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:38,679
KRIS: Your homebrew.

1210
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:42,219
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. I'm only up to level 20 on the abilities, but...

1211
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:43,759
AMY: Only? KATE: Why multiclass?

1212
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,880
JERRY: You can always take a level of concierge.

1213
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,420
You can take a level of concierge, sommelier... KATE: Yeah.   RYAN: Ooo.

1214
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,480
JERRY: Like, I'm expanding...the meaning! KRIS: That's nice.

1215
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,840
KRIS: That'd be worth it. JERRY: Right.   RYAN: Yeah.

1216
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,980
JERRY: But -- KATE: I'd be a "momcierge."

1217
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,119
JERRY: In any case... AMY: I go right up to them.

1218
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,139
JERRY: Inside to the right is clearly the main desk.

1219
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:05,400
To the left is an exhausted person

1220
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,880
who you think is prepared to assist you.

1221
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,820
AMY: So I go up to the... exhausted service person.

1222
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,280
I go--again, I go,

1223
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,920
"We got this missive. We're here to help --"

1224
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,340
JERRY: About halfway through, the eyes close and there's a nod.

1225
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,079
AMY: (deep breath) JERRY: (laughs)

1226
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:26,799
AMY: Walnut hates this SO much! RYAN: I'm already at 9!

1227
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,380
KATE: (laughs)   KRIS: This is the front door. RYAN: This is the goddamn inn all over again.

1228
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,180
JERRY: But it's OK.

1229
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:33,399
JERRY: They remove themselves --

1230
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,760
they sort of decouple themselves from their station

1231
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,820
and take you out through the main area which is a sort of lounge.

1232
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:46,400
There's a small bar over to the right. AMY: Mmhmm.   KRIS: Hmm.

1233
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:50,619
But you can see the interior structure of the venue is thus:

1234
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:54,519
there's a large sort of double stair that goes up in the front,

1235
00:50:54,519 --> 00:51:00,000
and then sort of behind you are two smaller staircases that go up.

1236
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,699
But they all attach to a single upper area.

1237
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:08,879
Off which is the rooms of the Doomgate Inn.

1238
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,500
And apparently there's some kind of event space...

1239
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,639
RYAN: Hmm. KRIS: Hmm. Kind of tasteful.

1240
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:16,319
- up the main section here in the beginning.

1241
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,620
- Hmm. OK.

1242
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,880
AMY: So he's taking us... JERRY: Yes, yes, yes. It takes a long time...

1243
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,960
- Oh. To get there.

1244
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,059
JERRY: But -- AMY: So we're up in the gallery.

1245
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:26,519
- Yeah, exactly. But...

1246
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:30,860
eventually this person is able to get you all the way to the landing.

1247
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:38,339
And you can see to the right of the double doors that lead into the next section,

1248
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,140
AMY: Mmhmm. JERRY: you can see...

1249
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,199
a statue of a man holding a goblet.

1250
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:46,519
- Sure.

1251
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:52,659
- But there is a constant flow of red wine...

1252
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:53,599
KRIS: Hmm.

1253
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,460
- flowing out of the cup

1254
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:58,539
AMY: Oh, yeah... JERRY: and then down into a...

1255
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,620
- a communal bowl, and then sort of cycling through...

1256
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,659
AMY: Sweet, it's like Bacchus's house. Awesome.

1257
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:09,839
KATE: Is there a glass? I'd like to sample the... JERRY: There is not a glass.

1258
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:13,119
JERRY: At this time. AMY: Like that's ever stopped Rosie before.

1259
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,940
JERRY: (scarfing food noises) KATE: Yeah that's true.   RYAN: Cup them hands.

1260
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,740
KATE: That's true. KRIS: Like is it for show? Or are we getting a little whiff?

1261
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:19,339
KRIS: Are we getting a little coppery whiff off of it?

1262
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,700
RYAN: Yeah, can I get -- KATE: I'm just gonna taste it.

1263
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:22,379
RYAN: I was gonna say, can I Perception?

1264
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,079
Alright. Tasting's probably more perceptive. KATE: Yeah, I don't care.

1265
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,639
JERRY: By mouth? RYAN: Yeah.

1266
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:28,339
AMY: You gotta eat a peck of dirt before you die.

1267
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,820
KATE: Yeah, yeah, that's right. (laughs)

1268
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,780
AMY: That's what my grandma used to say. KATE: People eat 27 spiders --

1269
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,980
KATE: adults, throughout their lives.

1270
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,980
KATE: So...may as well. AMY: True.

1271
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,159
JERRY: Spider wine. RYAN: A month!

1272
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:38,339
JERRY: So delicious. AMY: I hope to eat 27 TODAY.

1273
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,100
JERRY: No, a NIGHT. RYAN: Yeah.

1274
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:40,779
(laughter)

1275
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,860
JERRY: It's just a fucking -- AMY: Every one night.

1276
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,079
JERRY: It's just a train of spiders right in the mouth -- RYAN: A train of spiders and ants...

1277
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,480
KRIS: It's like an RDA thing, "Well good night everybody."

1278
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,019
(laughter)

1279
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:52,880
JERRY: Well no, if you want to get them all in you gotta start --

1280
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,680
KRIS: Oh yeah, yeah.

1281
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:55,719
JERRY: you gotta start at 11. KATE: Be proactive.

1282
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,699
RYAN: That's on average. Cuz some eat way more.

1283
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:59,719
AMY: Alright, so we make our way past this door.

1284
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,059
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: No, I'm gonna try the wine!

1285
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:02,619
AMY: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm building up to it! KATE: OK, OK.

1286
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:05,000
AMY: Walnut's holding this thing out like, "HELLO?"

1287
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,500
KATE: (laughs) AMY: "Someone in here. We're here to help!"

1288
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,840
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. So you're tasting wine? KATE: Yeah, yeah.

1289
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,579
JERRY: Give me... KATE: (slurps)

1290
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:13,939
JERRY: a Perception. RYAN: Alright.

1291
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,139
KATE: 21. JERRY: Just a Wisdom check.

1292
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:23,319
JERRY: Yeah, there is a note in it you can't place.

1293
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:23,940
KATE: Mmhmm.

1294
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,420
JERRY: You don't think that-- you don't think it's...human blood.

1295
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,460
KATE: OK. KRIS: (exhales in relief)

1296
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,280
KATE: (whew!) AMY: Dog blood.   RYAN: It's poison.

1297
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,620
RYAN: This is a cult. They're gonna -- (laughter)

1298
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:35,380
this is a Heaven's Gate thing. And you just drop dead!

1299
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,900
AMY: Oh Doomsgate! I get it. JERRY: And you just became a new member.

1300
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,360
KATE: Yeah, so here's the thing --

1301
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,099
JERRY: Already you begin to feel your thoughts are not your own.

1302
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:44,579
KATE: OK. Great. That's how I like to party.

1303
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:45,659
(laugher)

1304
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:49,379
KATE: I...so I don't taste human blood

1305
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,519
but the problem is, that doesn't reassure me at all,

1306
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,199
cuz none of us are human!

1307
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:54,539
KATE: So does it... AMY: That's true.   KRIS: Oh yeah...

1308
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:55,639
KATE: (laughs) KRIS: We don't know...

1309
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:57,519
KATE: Yea, it's just not--I'm not like (whew!)

1310
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:58,659
AMY: Does it taste like my blood?

1311
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:00,359
AMY: That I know from drinking a lot (laughs) RYAN: Yeah, should we all taste our own blood?

1312
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,000
(laughter)

1313
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,480
AMY: You should taste my blood! RYAN: Rosie! Drink our blood!

1314
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,519
RYAN: We're worried about vampires. Drink our blood.

1315
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:07,659
AMY: Could you do a double-blind taste test? It's like the Pepsi challenge.

1316
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:09,199
JERRY: But for blood. AMY: But for blood.

1317
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:11,279
KRIS: The other vampires are coming , "What's this?"

1318
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,580
(laughter)

1319
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:14,219
KATE: "A double-blind...!"

1320
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:16,399
JERRY: (accented vampire voice) "What is this new flavor?"

1321
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,679
JERRY: No.

1322
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:19,119
KATE: Alright. Cool.

1323
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,420
But does it get me fucked up?

1324
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,079
RYAN: Oh yeah.

1325
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,019
JERRY: You'd probably have to drink more to really keep it going.

1326
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:27,099
KATE: Alright. JERRY: It's up to you on how you wanna --

1327
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,860
JERRY: how you wanna present yourself. KATE: Alright, no. I'll come back to it.

1328
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,760
KATE: I'll come back to it.

1329
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,260
KATE: Let's do some work. RYAN: Drinking on the job?

1330
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,080
AMY: Yeah, we're on the job. RYAN: We're here to...do a thing.

1331
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,159
KRIS: Gauche. AMY: Yeah, we'll thieve on a job but not drink.

1332
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:38,859
JERRY: Your--Exactly, yeah, yeah. And rob! KATE: (laughs)

1333
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,880
AMY: Rob's a strong word.

1334
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,320
JERRY: And pirate! AMY: OK.

1335
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,180
JERRY: So -- KATE: Borrow indefinitely.

1336
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:46,939
JERRY: Your host pushes the doors open.

1337
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,480
Inside you can see...

1338
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,059
It's like a camurria type thing.

1339
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,480
Like it's vampire...

1340
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,019
it's vampire chic.

1341
00:54:58,159 --> 00:54:59,420
PARTY: Hmm.

1342
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,380
JERRY: Draperies. KRIS: Oh yeah.   KATE: (laughs)

1343
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,159
JERRY: Statues... AMY: Mmhmm.

1344
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:06,500
JERRY: of various kinds... KATE: Oh yeah!

1345
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:12,300
JERRY: that emphasized the primacy of the vampire over the living.

1346
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,680
JERRY: You know what I mean?

1347
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,679
KATE: Hmm.   KRIS: Got it. AMY: Hate this.

1348
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,419
JERRY: But there's also a performance...

1349
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,840
sort of a light stage in the rear corner.

1350
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:28,059
And you can see three people sort of preparing their instruments.

1351
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,820
JERRY: There's an aesthetic here.

1352
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:33,880
There's clearly an aesthetic!

1353
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,780
But...there's also a band?

1354
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,140
JERRY: And -- KRIS: Is there clearly anaesthetic?

1355
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:41,960
KRIS: If we don't wish to...

1356
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,599
KRIS: feel. KATE: I wish not to feel any of it.

1357
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,139
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

1358
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:46,480
KATE: Let's talk about these statues for a second.

1359
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,840
JERRY: You need some anaesthetic. KRIS: That's what I'm saying. (laughs)

1360
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:52,860
KATE: There's statues of vampires...performing bites?

1361
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,980
JERRY: Yeah, oh yeah. The bites--they're doing a bite.

1362
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,539
KATE: Doing bites. AMY: Don't do a bite.

1363
00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:58,779
KATE: Don't...do a bite. KRIS: Not yet...

1364
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:00,239
KATE: That's the name of this quest.

1365
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:01,539
JERRY: But here so--but in...

1366
00:56:01,539 --> 00:56:04,980
This is vitally important for defense specialists.

1367
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:07,079
JERRY: Like yourself. KATE: Sure.

1368
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:09,619
JERRY: Inside here to the left...

1369
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,119
there is a sequence of doors that go out on to a

1370
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,539
sort of veranda porch-type situation. KATE: OK.

1371
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:22,880
JERRY: Out there to the left and just inside here

1372
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,660
there are a few people milling about.

1373
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:33,420
So far you don't feel like the event has really reached critical mass yet.

1374
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,820
Also you didn't see these people come up through the gate.

1375
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,920
They did not come up with you. They were already here, apparently.

1376
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,659
KRIS: K.

1377
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:45,299
KATE: People are allowed to arrive before we get there. JERRY: Absolutely.

1378
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,220
JERRY: It's not Pink. You know what I mean? KATE: (laughs) That's right, yeah.

1379
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:49,839
KATE: Exactly. So --

1380
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,740
JERRY: The party can begin prior. KATE: That's right.   KRIS: Yeah.

1381
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,719
KATE: What are these--are these people also sort of pale and hungry looking?

1382
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,480
JERRY: No, they seem vigorous.

1383
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,599
KRIS: Oh?   RYAN: Ah. AMY: Ah the fangbangers themselves.

1384
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:03,099
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: The "fangbangers?"

1385
00:57:03,099 --> 00:57:04,480
AMY: No...?   KRIS: True Blood. AMY: True Blood? OK. (laughs)

1386
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,420
KATE: Oh sorry, sorry. Sorry.

1387
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,659
AMY: Adventures of Sookie Stackhouse?

1388
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,319
KATE: I should have done my research.

1389
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,580
JERRY: So as you come in...

1390
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:18,099
your host, the person who brought you up the stairs, says,

1391
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:19,059
"Sir."

1392
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:24,779
And in the centre of this coterie,

1393
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:29,660
a thoroughly, profoundly velveted man...

1394
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:37,940
wheels floatingly in your direction.

1395
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,380
He says,

1396
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,519
(slow vampire accent) "Ah yes." RYAN: (laughs)

1397
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,159
JERRY: "Acquisitions...Incorporated."

1398
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:48,039
KATE: (laughs) RYAN: "You have a funny voice."

1399
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:50,519
RYAN: I say, "You remind me the inside of my cart."

1400
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:52,019
KATE: (laughs)

1401
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:53,300
AMY: This immediately -- RYAN: "And I like it!"

1402
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,320
(laughter)

1403
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,240
AMY: I was gonna say this makes Walnut not like the cart.

1404
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,679
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: (laughs)

1405
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:59,980
RYAN: This makes me like him. I tell him that.

1406
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,559
JERRY: It gets expanded.

1407
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:08,460
He says, "I suspect you will want to make...preparations."

1408
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,360
"We may have...unwanted guests."

1409
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:16,360
AMY: "What kind of unwanted guests?" KRIS: "Grand. Absolutely."

1410
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:22,860
KRIS: "Whatever you can tell us about our duties. And where we might best..."

1411
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,420
RYAN: "Collect our reward?" JERRY: Exactly!

1412
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,940
KRIS: "Upon --" AMY: "That's gauche."

1413
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,960
RYAN: "We'll be getting it from you? I assume."

1414
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:35,379
JERRY: "There are those who find our...soirées...distasteful."

1415
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,880
AMY: "Well I can see why."

1416
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,039
JERRY: "And they constantly seek to interrupt..."

1417
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,020
"the natural order."

1418
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,739
KRIS: Mmmhmm. AMY: (restrained exhale)

1419
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,020
KRIS: "I know what that's like. And it's bad. No one likes that."

1420
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:52,440
RYAN: "I'm with you. I'm with whoever's paying."

1421
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,599
KATE: I come up to Walnut and I'm like,

1422
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:57,500
"We can go. We don't have to do this job." AMY: "No."

1423
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,559
KATE: "There's other jobs." AMY: "No, no! We'll do it."

1424
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:01,420
KATE: "OK." RYAN: "Yeah, this came from the home office."

1425
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,639
AMY: "Yup. It's fine." KATE: "OK. Alright."

1426
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:06,980
KRIS: "It's one night. What could happen"

1427
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,139
KRIS: "in a vampire house in one night?" RYAN: I'm liking these guys more and more.

1428
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:11,719
RYAN: I just like hanging out with them. KATE: (laughs)

1429
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:15,459
RYAN: I'm like, "I kinda like-- I'm picking up what he's putting down!"

1430
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,059
RYAN: It's the velvet. Draped in velvet is what won me over.

1431
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:22,079
KRIS: Tooth care. RYAN: Yeah, they got really pearly whites.

1432
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,279
RYAN. I'm like, "Me too."

1433
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,640
JERRY: So you're asking for directions.

1434
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,299
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: And he says,

1435
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,220
"I did not hire specialists..."

1436
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:36,799
"to give...step-by-step directions."

1437
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,239
KRIS: "Oh, of course not. We understand that."

1438
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:44,699
"But are you used to these interlopers approaching from a given --"

1439
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:46,179
JERRY: "Constantly."

1440
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:48,440
KRIS: "Oh just from all sides then."

1441
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,940
JERRY: "24 hours a day." KRIS: Hmm.

1442
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,960
AMY: "Well maybe they have a point." KATE:  "Quick question..."

1443
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,880
KATE: "What kind of interlopers?"

1444
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,300
"Is it human interlopers? Or maybe a different species...?"

1445
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:03,579
JERRY: "It's a mélange."

1446
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:06,440
KATE: "Of course it is. Of course it is." RYAN: (giggles)

1447
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,719
KATE: Alright.

1448
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,159
KRIS: "Have you tried anything in the past that didn't work out for you?"

1449
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:16,139
"That we might be apprised of."

1450
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,300
JERRY: "Other services..."

1451
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,400
"were not able to deliver the results."

1452
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,840
KATE: So our reputation's on the line.

1453
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,280
RYAN &amp; KRIS: Hmm. KATE: Great.

1454
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,040
JERRY: "Are you familiar with..."

1455
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:30,420
"Dran Enterprises?"

1456
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,820
AMY: "Oh!"   KRIS: "Vaguely." KATE: "Uh...it rings a bell."

1457
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,940
JERRY: "Dran Enterprises employees were paid..."

1458
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:46,019
"by the interlopers... to join them...in an assault..."

1459
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:48,400
KRIS: (tsk tsk sounds)

1460
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,000
AMY: I'm like so damn bored. JERRY: "on my foyer."

1461
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,760
AMY: "Well we're not like those fly-by-night Dran Enterprises."

1462
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,700
RYAN: "What about The Six? Have you heard of them? I hear they're cool."

1463
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,859
KRIS: Do you just come out with it? RYAN: Yeah!

1464
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,200
KATE: Here's a guy I know. RYAN: Yeah.

1465
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,980
JERRY: "It may be..."

1466
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,699
"that I will be hiring The Six..."

1467
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,619
"for my next event."

1468
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:12,799
RYAN: Hmm!

1469
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,119
RYAN: Info. AMY: "Do you have their number?"

1470
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,500
(laughter)

1471
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,039
KRIS: What are you going to subcontract? RYAN: Yeah!

1472
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:21,019
KRIS: No. We're going to do this.

1473
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,840
AMY: Alright. No I just meant for later. RYAN: You can just subcontract it out. (laughs)

1474
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,500
JERRY: You're waved away with some incredibly long fingers.

1475
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,000
KRIS: (impact sound) Ah.

1476
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,280
(laughter)

1477
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,120
AMY: (gags) KATE: OK.

1478
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:37,659
JERRY: As you turn back toward the doorway,

1479
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:42,759
two more revelers enter the space.

1480
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,980
KRIS: Mmhmm.

1481
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,340
KATE: On foot? JERRY: On foot.

1482
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,860
KATE: OK. JERRY: Yeah, not as bats.

1483
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,160
RYAN: Yeah. Or trapezes! (laughs)

1484
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,500
(laughter)

1485
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,880
JERRY: Cirque du Soleil. They'd swing in... AMY: A fine mist...   RYAN: Yeah.

1486
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,380
KRIS: How do we know they're not plain old bat? RYAN: Hut! Hi! Ho! Hut!

1487
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,760
KRIS: Because they have a party hat on.

1488
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,640
(laughter) AMY: Party bats.

1489
01:01:57,639 --> 01:01:59,679
KATE: Now -- JERRY: Party bats! That's it!

1490
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,079
KATE: Something about-- I love parties, I love...

1491
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:04,440
JERRY: Bats? KATE: Bats!

1492
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,380
KATE: So this is--that's all I had to say! (laughs)

1493
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,340
(laughter)

1494
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:12,480
KATE: No, I'd like to go enter parties and to kind of...

1495
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,480
fuck with the dynamic a little bit. So...

1496
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,719
JERRY: Oh sure. KATE: This is something I've done my entire life.

1497
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:19,439
I just love...I love being at parties and messing with things.

1498
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,659
AMY: Rosie?   KATE: Rosie. RYAN: Is this as Kate?

1499
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:21,960
RYAN: OK. AMY: Oh yeah, I'm like...

1500
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,119
KATE: There's--who's Kate?

1501
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,039
AMY: Right. RYAN: I thought we were breaking (stammer)

1502
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,639
RYAN: I thought this was just info.

1503
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,480
KATE: Here's a little bit about me! RYAN: Yeah here's all about me, guys!

1504
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,760
KRIS: You ruin parties. RYAN: I like fucking up parties!

1505
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,240
(laughter) AMY: So don't invite me to any!

1506
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,939
AMY: Or do. JERRY: Check this!

1507
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,400
KATE: And my motivation for messing with parties is just because

1508
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,500
I want people to have like the best possible time!

1509
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,980
JERRY: Yeah. You want to elevate the proceedings.

1510
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,619
KATE: Exactly. And I don't want to be seen.

1511
01:02:45,619 --> 01:02:47,519
So this is already a dark place,

1512
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:48,940
is just I'm comfortable in,

1513
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,800
I see parties happening.

1514
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,019
So I start to kinda like suss  out the social machinations

1515
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:55,840
that are going on between these people.

1516
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,700
When one person seems like they might be casting glances shyly at someone else,

1517
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:02,980
KATE: I'll make sure they like end up in a conversation. KRIS: Oh...

1518
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,460
- So I'm darting around the room, just like messing with stuff.

1519
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:09,900
Little puppet mastering because that's how I get my fucking rocks off.

1520
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,000
KATE: So that's what I'm doing. JERRY: Just pulling threads?

1521
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,679
- Yeah, yeah.

1522
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:14,199
- Dolly Levi. It's a "Hello Dolly!" reference.

1523
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:15,739
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KRIS: You should watch it. It's a great musical.

1524
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,960
AMY: (laughs) JERRY: Exactly.

1525
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,260
KATE: Will do. JERRY: So yeah...

1526
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:26,160
JERRY: So you tell me how you want to satisfy the demands of this job?

1527
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:27,119
KRIS: I want to know --

1528
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,380
JERRY: It sounds like you want to work on the inside. KATE: Yup.

1529
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,700
RYAN: Well yeah. I feel like we need to assess the room, right?

1530
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:34,579
So we need to take inventory of entrances and exits?

1531
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:35,340
KRIS: Right.

1532
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,039
KATE: Yeah we got the porch...the veranda...entrance. JERRY: Mmhmm.

1533
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:39,719
KATE: And then the entrance we came into.

1534
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:42,500
Are there any windows or doors other than that that we should know about?

1535
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,299
JERRY: Absolutely. Yeah, this --

1536
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,860
KRIS: All over the place! RYAN: It's one giant window!

1537
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,559
JERRY: The whole thing is all glass.

1538
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,799
It's like that cathedral in California.

1539
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:56,820
So yeah, there are windows but not windows with solid access...

1540
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,120
AMY: Mmm. KRIS: Mmm.

1541
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:03,400
JERRY: on the east wall. The west wall is the one that has direct access to the veranda.

1542
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:09,420
There is a sequence of 3 double doors that sort of go out there.

1543
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,760
JERRY: Right now they are closed. KATE: OK.   KRIS: Mmhmm.

1544
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:17,159
JERRY: You might have to explore a little bit more to figure out the rest of it.

1545
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:20,839
But like I say. The windows on the right side don't appear to have any access.

1546
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:29,680
The far wall here is completely solid except for a door that goes back to a kitchen.

1547
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:31,859
A service type door. KRIS: OK.

1548
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,800
KRIS: I want to know whether or not the properties of Alarm...

1549
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:39,960
if it can determine...

1550
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,659
I mean I suppose I could look that up too. JERRY: If it can it determine flavor?

1551
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:45,399
KRIS: Yeah, cuz I know I can sort by size.

1552
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,700
KRIS: And that's not really...there's gonna be people coming in.

1553
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:50,059
RYAN: Put an Alarm up and as soon as-- Yeah, there's vampires everywhere.

1554
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:51,820
RYAN: Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! (laughter)

1555
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:56,720
KRIS: No it's like I know I can filter by like humanoid or like small creature...

1556
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:59,139
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: If you come in as a bat, if you can...

1557
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:03,839
and if it's some dude coming in, then I'm assuming that's, "Keep an eye on him!"

1558
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,559
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: Yeah like...

1559
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:08,119
RYAN: how many people are we expecting...? KRIS: I don't know if Alarm can...yeah.

1560
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:10,239
RYAN: You set Event Planner on this now.

1561
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,359
JERRY: Well yeah. There's an event planning opportunity, right?

1562
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,079
JERRY: You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion.

1563
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,880
Choose a door, window, or area within range that is no larger than a 20 feet.

1564
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,160
KRIS: Mmhmm. JERRY: Yeah, as a cube.

1565
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:25,699
JERRY: Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature

1566
01:05:25,699 --> 01:05:27,419
touches or enters the warded area.

1567
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,139
KRIS: Right. JERRY: When you cast the spell,

1568
01:05:29,139 --> 01:05:32,000
you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm.

1569
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,980
KRIS: Yeah. AMY: Ta-da.

1570
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:35,380
JERRY: You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

1571
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,160
KRIS: Right.

1572
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:39,500
Jerry: It alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile.

1573
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,099
This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

1574
01:05:42,099 --> 01:05:43,339
KRIS: Nice.

1575
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:46,340
JERRY: The audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds.

1576
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:53,300
KRIS: OK. I mean from that it sounds like I could sort by like beast or whatever.

1577
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,840
RYAN: Mmm. KRIS: But...

1578
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,300
- I don't know if I can sort by intent.

1579
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,920
Or somebody who's...

1580
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:03,299
JERRY: No, no... KRIS: It's not like a metal detector.

1581
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,440
- No exactly. Well in some ways it is, I mean, you're basically... (stammers)

1582
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,460
JERRY: It's tiny or larger creatures. KRIS: Yeah.

1583
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,240
- And then you're also determining who WON'T set it off.

1584
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:13,739
JERRY: So those are the two rules you can establish... KRIS: Right. OK.

1585
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:17,279
- to determine that volume of Alarmed space.

1586
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,560
KRIS: Yeah. KATE: I think it's a good idea.

1587
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,179
- I'll do it but I don't want to get a headache, is what I'm saying (laughs)

1588
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:22,619
JERRY: (phone ringing sounds) KRIS: If there's a lot of people coming in...

1589
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:24,659
- and I gotta look at each one, I'm already...

1590
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:27,039
KRIS: I might as well just look at the door. RYAN: I mean someone's gonna have to post up

1591
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,579
RYAN: near a door, right? We can't just mingle.

1592
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:30,539
KATE: I think we could probably watch over the door,

1593
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:34,059
but maybe you can set that on the edge of the veranda

1594
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:37,239
in case anyone comes up over the porch. RYAN: Yeah.

1595
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:38,899
KATE: That make sense? KRIS: Yeah that makes sense, yeah.

1596
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,680
KRIS: Whatever looks like the most sneaky entrance. RYAN: Yeah.   KATE: Yeah.

1597
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:47,460
RYAN: I think if watching the veranda's good, I'll post up at the front door.

1598
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,760
KATE: Yeah, you're large.

1599
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,320
RYAN: So we are assessing this situation as:

1600
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,039
This is a vampire party and we're protecting them from vampire hunters?

1601
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:55,579
KATE: Maybe: RYAN: Yeah.

1602
01:06:55,579 --> 01:06:56,639
KATE &amp; KRIS: Yeah.

1603
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,759
AMY: Walnut doesn't want to look at this anymore, so...

1604
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,360
(laughter) AMY: She wants to...

1605
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,240
AMY: Just the idea of things that are cheating death

1606
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:06,719
and the natural cycle of things just sucks to her,

1607
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:08,259
and also all this opulence.

1608
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:14,460
So she wants to go back and see if there is a servant's entrance.

1609
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,559
RYAN: Well yeah, there's a kitchen entrance. AMY: Right there's a kitchen so I'm assuming,

1610
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:19,980
AMY: I mean, they don't have the people working...

1611
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,539
So...she wants to go.

1612
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:24,820
JERRY: Yeah you wanna examine that? AMY: Yeah I wanna go examine and see if there's a...

1613
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,400
JERRY: Absolutely. KATE: Is that back downstairs?

1614
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,119
JERRY: Well here. So the door for the service entrance is immediately at the back wall...

1615
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:33,759
AMY: Mmhmm., JERRY: of this.

1616
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,200
JERRY: I mean, as security, you have the run if you wanna...

1617
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,579
AMY: I do.  JERRY: take advantage of the situation, go right ahead.

1618
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:41,659
- Yes, I wanna go check it out.

1619
01:07:41,659 --> 01:07:43,099
- (clears throat) So you go through.

1620
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:46,420
Push--it's one of these swinging doors you could open with the tray, presumably.

1621
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:50,799
You can see a sort of simple...

1622
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,160
country kitchen, scaled up a bit.

1623
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:57,399
And there's also a staircase here, AMY: Mmhmm.

1624
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,700
JERRY: that goes downstairs. KRIS: Hmm.   AMY: OK.

1625
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:01,500
AMY: I'm gonna go down there. JERRY: K.

1626
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,579
AMY: And I just toss right over my shoulder,

1627
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,039
I'm like, "Uh you guys have out here."

1628
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,259
JERRY: (laughs) (gurgle sound)

1629
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,320
AMY: I hate it...I hate it. JERRY: Yeah.

1630
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,420
KRIS: I just love the, "I don't like (mutters)... I hate it. I hate it!"

1631
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,239
(laughter) KRIS: You can't keep it under anymore.

1632
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:19,460
JERRY: You have to say it, even if it's just to yourself.

1633
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,439
AMY: Oh, absolutely. JERRY: It just has to get said!

1634
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:27,039
JERRY: So you head around this backway, head down this set of stairs,

1635
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,399
and there is, in fact, an exit

1636
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:35,259
that goes out the back of the entire Doomgate Inn. AMY: Mmhmm.

1637
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:37,119
JERRY: And then there's another smallish kitchen here

1638
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:42,559
you think must serve the downstairs lounge area as well.

1639
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:48,700
JERRY: But there is an exit here that goes  directly outside through this low kitchen.

1640
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:51,779
AMY: Hmm OK well... KATE: Smart thinking.

1641
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,160
- Table talk: Are we ok posting out away from each other? Or is that...?

1642
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:01,239
RYAN: (sighs) Well that's the thing -- AMY: Do you just wanna do interiors at the doors?

1643
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:02,800
RYAN: Are we protecting the whole building

1644
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,860
RYAN: or just the room? KATE: Just the party.

1645
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:04,380
RYAN: Yeah.

1646
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,279
KATE: But I think you can probably still watch that entrance from the top of the stairs.

1647
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,859
AMY: Yeah, I'll do that. KATE: Just in case things pop up.

1648
01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:10,979
AMY: So I'll just be hanging out in the kitchen. JERRY: Mmhmm.

1649
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,979
JERRY: Backroom?   AMY: Mmhmm. JERRY: K.

1650
01:09:14,539 --> 01:09:15,600
JERRY: What are you looking at Donaar?

1651
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,660
RYAN: I'm thinking I'll watch the main entrance.

1652
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:19,720
AMY: You look like a bouncer. RYAN: As an imposing figure, yeah.

1653
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,680
KATE: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,119
RYAN: And -- KRIS: I'd like to--Oh sorry. Go ahead.

1655
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:24,199
RYAN: And then--well yeah cuz you'll be...

1656
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:26,599
JERRY: Basically by the... RYAN: mingling and mixing within the crowd.

1657
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,980
JERRY: by the wine statue.

1658
01:09:27,979 --> 01:09:30,779
RYAN: Yeah. And you're kinda watching the veranda-ish, right?

1659
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:34,399
KRIS: Yeah. Now another question for the DM. JERRY: Mmhmm.

1660
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:37,399
KRIS: This is a...and I let each of you know this part.

1661
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:39,979
Cuz this is a thing I haven't done yet.

1662
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:42,319
So I will Alarm the veranda.

1663
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,399
And I'll make it audible--do you all wanna hear it? KATE: Mmhmm.

1664
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:47,119
RYAN: Yeah I feel like we should.

1665
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,779
KRIS: But I also can do Unseen Servant.

1666
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:53,380
Amy: Mmm. KRIS: And it lasts for an hour.

1667
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,320
KRIS: If it lasts longer, ask your doctor.

1668
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:57,260
(laugher)

1669
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:01,140
And it lasts for an hour. It can't do much.

1670
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,480
It is not visible.

1671
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:07,339
But...I'm asking could it keep watch over some area and then it would come get me?

1672
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,560
KRIS: It has to stay within 60 feet of me, JERRY: Yeah basically they can do --

1673
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,520
KRIS: so it just covers a lot more area. JERRY: they can do light labor. Right?

1674
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,120
KRIS: Yeah, they're not super strong.

1675
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:16,199
Like it can fold napkins or whatever.

1676
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:18,539
KRIS: It's not a fighting creature. RYAN: Like, for someone to get into this room,

1677
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:20,079
RYAN: like they have to get into the building,

1678
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:21,899
and then be escorted into the room like we were, right?

1679
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:24,960
So like theoretically too, anyone who's going to come through the front door,

1680
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,300
like Jeeves is gonna catch first, right?

1681
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:31,440
KRIS: It's gonna be...maybe something for you to suss out.

1682
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:35,039
As opposed to, "let's break the doors down," and...yeah.

1683
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:38,699
JERRY: Unseen Servants do stuff and they more or less do stuff at your direction.

1684
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:42,579
AMY: There you go! Nice. JERRY: It basically uses up your bonus action

1685
01:10:42,579 --> 01:10:45,300
JERRYY: but they perform simple tasks that a human servant could do,

1686
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,500
such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes,

1687
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,039
lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine.

1688
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:53,019
JERRY: And then once you give the command -- RYAN: It's gonna give you a backrub.

1689
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:57,300
JERRY: Yeah. Once you give the command it performs the task to the best of its ability,

1690
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,100
and then waits for your next command.

1691
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,860
AMY: (laughs) That's what I was doing.

1692
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:01,880
KRIS: Exactly the joke.

1693
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,920
After it does that...

1694
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,880
I say... (laughter)

1695
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,180
So that you all can see it as well

1696
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:12,860
I'm gonna tastefully drape...a uh...

1697
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:14,899
JERRY: Some velvet? KRIS: a velvet cloth...

1698
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:17,420
KRIS: over it so that it's just this figure.

1699
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,220
AMY: (laughs) It just looks like -- RYAN: A ghost?

1700
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,800
KRIS: Yeah, a very soft ghost. AMY: a little ghost?

1701
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,039
RYAN: A velvet ghost? KRIS: Plush. Yeah.

1702
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:25,699
JERRY: That's an incredible band name.

1703
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:27,899
RYAN: Yes, that was my nickname in college. AMY: Soft Ghost?

1704
01:11:27,899 --> 01:11:29,879
JERRY: Soft Ghost! #softghost RYAN: Velvet Ghost?

1705
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,220
KATE: (laughs) KRIS: It's also a genre.

1706
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,320
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: Yeah.

1707
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,559
AMY: Alright. KRIS: (stammers) I will have it...

1708
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:39,439
I don't know. It could circle a perimeter.

1709
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:41,819
And then if there's anything...

1710
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:46,819
JERRY: It's sort of like a servant. So the best it could do would be to come back and talk to you.

1711
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:48,500
KRIS: That's all it could do, yeah. That's what I want.

1712
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,939
RYAN: Or laundry.   AMY: Or laundry. JERRY: Or, yeah, or laundry.

1713
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,919
RYAN: Or dry cleaning. KRIS: If it has time.

1714
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,100
(laughter)

1715
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,060
KRIS: Use your best judgment. Oh you have no judgment.

1716
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,180
JERRY: I know Thursdays are very busy for you. KATE: (laughs)

1717
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:01,880
KATE: OK. KRIS: Alright, so it's out and about.

1718
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,819
KATE: I would like to make some observations,

1719
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:08,179
if I could, about the party-going members.

1720
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:11,280
JERRY: Mmhmm. KATE: And you've told me that they were vigorous?

1721
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:17,439
And they are--I assume there are vampires mixed in with them that are conversing with them?

1722
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:18,859
Is that a safe assumption?

1723
01:12:18,859 --> 01:12:20,880
- Do you know a lot about vampires?

1724
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,940
- I mean, I have a History. I could do...

1725
01:12:24,939 --> 01:12:27,799
I'm sure I read about them. I spent a lot of time in libraries.

1726
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,260
So...they're not that obscure, are they?

1727
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:36,020
- Well generally, vampires-- seeing actual vampires is not...

1728
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:38,020
that's not normal. KATE: That's not common.

1729
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,120
JERRY: No. (laughs) KATE: Sure.

1730
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:42,840
- No, no. Generally speaking if you see a vampire, that's usually the last thing you see.

1731
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,300
KATE: Right. OK, so -- JERRY: They're incredibly powerful...

1732
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:49,000
subversions of life.

1733
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,100
KATE: OK. We'll say "vampires" in quotes then. JERRY:  Yeah.

1734
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,940
- Can I just do some kind of like studying the room...

1735
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,479
making notes of these people. JERRY: No, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, just...

1736
01:12:57,479 --> 01:13:00,139
JERRY: basically like extend your social awareness... KATE: Yes.

1737
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,020
JERRY: out into the room? Sure. KATE:  Correct. Yeah.

1738
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:07,000
- And I wanna make sure that if anything starts to disrupt

1739
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,140
what feels like a pretty jovial party,

1740
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,880
if I start to sense anything that's going on, I wanna be aware of it.

1741
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,840
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: I wanna be...

1742
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,900
KATE: making my way around that room and keeping an eye on everything that's going on.

1743
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:18,920
JERRY: Absolutely. KATE: OK.

1744
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,420
- There is a note...

1745
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:23,760
there is a note that you hear constantly.

1746
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,220
Even as you're observing just different conversations.

1747
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:29,800
You can tell they don't really wanna be surveilled in the classic sense.

1748
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,860
Like as you approach, it definitely gets quieter, but you know,

1749
01:13:33,859 --> 01:13:37,239
you've overheard a conversation or two...

1750
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:40,000
in your time. You know how to do this. KATE: Sure.

1751
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,980
JERRY: (clears throat)

1752
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:49,699
A lot of them are worried that Trevor will try to come back.

1753
01:13:49,699 --> 01:13:51,059
KRIS: (laughs)

1754
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,060
RYAN: God. Story of my life, am I right?

1755
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,480
KATE: They're worried about Trevor.

1756
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,220
AMY: Mmhmm. KATE: K.

1757
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,180
JERRY: And of course when I say Trevor, I mean

1758
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,320
(slow vampire accent) "Trevor."

1759
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,599
AMY: Mmm.

1760
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,020
KATE: OK. And is... JERRY: It's been a problem, I guess.

1761
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,080
KATE: OK. Is Sombar still in the room?

1762
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:07,260
JERRY: Absolutely. KATE: OK.

1763
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,860
JERRY: Absolutely, Sombar... he is in his element.

1764
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:12,839
KATE: OK. JERRY: He's just sort of...

1765
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,239
JERRY: flitting from tiny circle to tiny circle.

1766
01:14:17,239 --> 01:14:19,659
And they seem to bloom every time he arrives.

1767
01:14:19,659 --> 01:14:22,039
KATE: A butterfly. A vampire butterfly. AMY: Vamping it up.

1768
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:25,039
KATE: Can I grab his attention and just very casually...

1769
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:27,760
bring him to a part of the room where no can look? JERRY: Sure, sure, sure.

1770
01:14:28,939 --> 01:14:30,579
JERRY: "I can spare a moment."

1771
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:32,439
KATE: "OK, all I need's a moment."

1772
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:35,359
"Can you tell me something about...Trevor?"

1773
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,199
JERRY: His eyes narrow.

1774
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,840
"Is he here?"

1775
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,460
KATE: "I don't think so but it sounds like people are worried about him."

1776
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:46,480
"So I just wanted to get your take on what this guy might bring for us."

1777
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:50,179
JERRY: "You will know Trevor..."

1778
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:52,439
"when you see him."

1779
01:14:52,819 --> 01:14:57,420
KATE: "OK." JERRY: "He is not allowed in the party."

1780
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,440
KATE: "Aww he's a bummer, huh?"

1781
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:01,219
JERRY: "He's Trevor."

1782
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:03,319
KATE: (laughs) "Enough said."

1783
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:04,960
RYAN: Description? Anything?

1784
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,300
(laughter)

1785
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,699
KATE: You'll know him when you see him. RYAN: Yeah.

1786
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,780
RYAN: I need to start grabbing people.

1787
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:11,559
"Are you Trevor? Are you Trevor?"

1788
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,580
(laughter)

1789
01:15:12,579 --> 01:15:14,180
Start yelling into the crowd. "TREVOR!"

1790
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,940
KATE: Alright. I do tell you about it.

1791
01:15:15,939 --> 01:15:18,039
I'm like, "Hey. There's someone named Trevor,"

1792
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:20,399
"maybe like don't let anybody who LOOKS like a Trevor..."

1793
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:21,839
RYAN: And we'll "know"?  KATE: "into the party."

1794
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,800
KATE: (laughs) RYAN: Yeah, start asking--I gotta start carding.

1795
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,739
RYAN: That's the thing, right?

1796
01:15:25,739 --> 01:15:27,179
KRIS: Dude's a total Trevor. RYAN: Yeah.

1797
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:33,060
JERRY: (stammers) As you have extended your grandma-sense...

1798
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:33,880
KATE: Mmhmm.

1799
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:39,840
JERRY: to, you know, seize all social data from this room,

1800
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:45,659
they mostly--they seem--they just seem...young.

1801
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:47,960
Stunted in some way.

1802
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,279
Never truly...

1803
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:58,360
Never truly becoming the whole people, that you'd want, you know, in your own children.

1804
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:01,339
They seem to be sort of stuck at a certain point.

1805
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:05,260
That's your read of the room.

1806
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,239
KATE: OK, so they're immature emotionally? Or...?

1807
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:12,619
JERRY: Yeah. (stutters) It sorta seems like they're wearing their dad's coat or something.

1808
01:16:12,619 --> 01:16:13,960
KATE: I see. JERRY: You know what I mean?

1809
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,399
KRIS: Nouveau riche. RYAN: Yeah.   JERRY: Yeah.

1810
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:18,259
KATE: They're just sort of awkward? RYAN: Or once you get turned into a vampire,

1811
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,239
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: you're stuck at that age.

1812
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:22,219
KATE: Uncomfortable in their own skin? JERRY: Yeah, yeah exactly. Exactly.

1813
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,100
JERRY: So you can see...

1814
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:30,860
at your place at the top of the stairs, the double stairs,

1815
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:39,479
you can see a figure reach out and push the door in...

1816
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,740
and then sort of walk like --

1817
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:45,859
have you ever seen--it's like...

1818
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,820
the way a person walks when they're trying very hard

1819
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:52,399
to project the idea that they belong in a place?

1820
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:53,259
AMY: Mmm.

1821
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,800
- Like in the food court,

1822
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,760
you sort of (stammers) their presence extends beyond their tiny table,

1823
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,079
yea, you know, unto...the China Express...

1824
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:07,199
KRIS: Is it like somebody taking a loud business call somewhere?

1825
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,179
RYAN &amp; JERRY: Yeah.

1826
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:12,100
RYAN: It's like a Bluetooth thing. Buy low sell high!

1827
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,820
JERRY: And you can -- (laughs) That's the key, see!

1828
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:20,159
And so you can see that the servants...

1829
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:24,800
they sort of move in a half-hearted attempt to stop this person

1830
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,300
and then they sort of curve out into their own orbits.

1831
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:32,539
RYAN: Alright. KATE: Did you let Trevor in?

1832
01:17:32,539 --> 01:17:35,279
RYAN: Well...I see this so I approach him.

1833
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:40,400
JERRY: The closer this person gets, the more clear

1834
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:44,699
it is that it's not a person in the classic sense.

1835
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:48,359
But is, in fact, a 6 foot tall,

1836
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:50,659
bipedal wolf. RYAN: Hmm.

1837
01:17:50,659 --> 01:17:52,239
AMY: Now we're talkin'. RYAN: Yeah.

1838
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,699
RYAN: And I see a name tag. Trevor.

1839
01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:55,939
KATE: (laughs)

1840
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:58,819
KRIS: It's got a little accent above it. AMY: I wish I was there.   RYAN: Uh yeah.

1841
01:17:58,819 --> 01:18:00,960
RYAN: I go -- (laughs) (French accent) Trevôr.

1842
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,640
KRIS: (French accent) Trevôr.

1843
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,140
JERRY: (laughs) Yeah, there's like four R's.

1844
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:05,220
AMY: Trevorrrr.

1845
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,980
RYAN: So it's a bipedal wolf...in clothing...?

1846
01:18:08,979 --> 01:18:11,279
JERRY: No. RYAN: Oh, no? Just a big old naked wolf.

1847
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:13,359
JERRY: Just a big naked ass -- KATE: So you just literally, you let...

1848
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:15,739
KATE: a wolf just walk in. RYAN: I didn't LET anything in. He told me it happened!

1849
01:18:15,739 --> 01:18:17,659
RYAN: I didn't have a chance to stop it!

1850
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,300
I guess I could interrupt mid-sentence.

1851
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,820
JERRY: "Hey, hey! I don't know what the fuck you're doing here."

1852
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:22,659
RYAN: Yeah. Before you get to that period, wait a second.

1853
01:18:22,659 --> 01:18:24,739
Here's what I do, I punch it in the goddamn face!

1854
01:18:24,739 --> 01:18:25,760
(laughter)

1855
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,860
And I bark at the moon!

1856
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,560
I go, "Hey, Wolfy!"

1857
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:30,940
"Can I help you with something?"

1858
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:34,839
JERRY: (slurred Southern drawl in gentle voice) "Yeah. I'm just here to attend that there party."

1859
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,619
JERRY: "They got a party goin' on there, I just wanna --" RYAN: "I dunno...You got an invite, friend?"

1860
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:39,539
JERRY: "Well I..."

1861
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,920
"My cousin...my cousin duh...my cousin operates the Doomgate Inn..."

1862
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,960
RYAN: "I don't believe any of this."

1863
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,760
JERRY: "It's a...I understand there's a party going on?"

1864
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,980
RYAN: "No..." KATE: (laughs)

1865
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:52,600
RYAN: "Not for you, friend."

1866
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,180
AMY: (laughs) RYAN: I usher him out by the scruff of the neck.

1867
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:57,020
RYAN: Like, "I'm gonna have to see an invitation" JERRY: "But he's my cousin, I --"

1868
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,760
RYAN: "or you gotta go, buddy. JERRY: "No, he's my cousin, he's gonna --"

1869
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,900
RYAN: "No."

1870
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,760
JERRY: "I'll tell him--I'll tell him--!" RYAN: I push and, "No! Push!" and I keep pushing.

1871
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,159
JERRY: (fast slurred Southern drawl babbling) "Now Imma come back and Imma tell my cousin"

1872
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,880
"that a big goddamn dragonman...push me out."

1873
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,840
RYAN: "You're gonna have to keep your voice down, sir!"

1874
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,900
"Sir. You're gonna have to keep your voice down."

1875
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:18,719
JERRY: You can--you just see the relief on the servant's face, as you take him just by the scruff...

1876
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,480
KATE: (whispers) Oh my God. JERRY: and just push him straight out the door.

1877
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:24,419
JERRY: And is there a cap on the end of it?

1878
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,480
As you push him out into the night?

1879
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,359
RYAN: I just give him a little push, I close the doors, and I (clap hands) a little hand dust.

1880
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:32,279
KATE: Nice. RYAN: Turn around and go...

1881
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:34,319
(laughter)

1882
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:35,880
KRIS: On it! RYAN: On it!

1883
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,819
KRIS: No worries.

1884
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:39,340
AMY: Bounced the shit out of that wolf! KRIS: "Enjoy your party."

1885
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,880
RYAN: "I got rid of Trevor! Enjoy the party, everyone!"

1886
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,859
(laughter)

1887
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:46,279
RYAN: I killed Trevor.

1888
01:19:46,279 --> 01:19:48,359
AMY: You're just gonna stand there, "Trevor's dead, everyone."

1889
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:49,920
RYAN: Trevor's dead. I'm the best!

1890
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,619
Enjoy your night!

1891
01:19:51,619 --> 01:19:53,159
(laughter)

1892
01:19:53,699 --> 01:19:56,139
JERRY: Sponsored by Donaar Blit'zen!

1893
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,039
JERRY: So, you are...

1894
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,640
walking your way back up the stairs,

1895
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,420
and about halfway up you hear the door swing open again.

1896
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:12,639
RYAN: "Goddamn Trevor."

1897
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,279
JERRY: (stammers) Is that on your lips?

1898
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:17,979
RYAN: Yeah, oh yeah! I just go,

1899
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,859
"God, I told you, Wolfy."

1900
01:20:19,859 --> 01:20:22,039
JERRY: (clears throat) So you turn around,

1901
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:23,640
and it is not Trevor.

1902
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,640
RYAN: (gasps)

1903
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:25,940
JERRY: Yeah.

1904
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:27,479
DUN! DUN! DUN!!!

1905
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:28,500
KATE: (laughs) RYAN: Thanks for the stream, everyone!

1906
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,939
JERRY: Peace out!

1907
01:20:30,699 --> 01:20:31,739
JERRY: Yo it's J Real!

1908
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:33,559
(laughter)

1909
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,640
JERRY: You turn down...

1910
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,119
JERRY: and there are three -- RYAN: For what?

1911
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,780
(laughter)

1912
01:20:38,779 --> 01:20:41,199
AMY: Kill me. KRIS: Let the adventure begin.

1913
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,619
JERRY: Yeah.   KRIS: Please. AMY: Kill me.   KATE: Don't high five him.

1914
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:45,720
(laughter) JERRY: Whatever you do...!

1915
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,100
It's like feeding him after midnight.

1916
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,160
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Truly, don't high five him ever.

1917
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:52,099
JERRY: So, you see...

1918
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:57,180
a row of three figures enter in.

1919
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,240
Tall leather hats,

1920
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:01,039
short brims around the edge...

1921
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:03,000
KRIS: Mmhmm. RYAN: Oh. Pilgrims.

1922
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,060
KRIS: Ugh. KATE: Ugh gross.

1923
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,440
RYAN: Buckles...(laughs)

1924
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,820
JERRY: Rich brown leather coats.

1925
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,180
Stakes...

1926
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:14,420
AMY: Oh. KRIS: Aww.

1927
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,600
AMY: Wait... KATE: Meat? Or Wood?

1928
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,880
(laughter)

1929
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,480
RYAN: Medium rare. All the way to rare, very rare.

1930
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:22,079
JERRY: Wooden stakes. RYAN: Oh!   AMY: Oh.

1931
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:24,319
KATE: (laughs) A steak salesman... RYAN: Yeah.   JERRY: Yeah.

1932
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:27,359
JERRY: Beef. It's like USDA

1933
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,220
Angus!

1934
01:21:29,699 --> 01:21:31,460
You know what I mean? That's the choicest cut!

1935
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,480
KRIS: Woo! Look at them cuts.

1936
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:34,239
RYAN: Where from? Vermont?

1937
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,859
(party talking over each other)

1938
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,380
RYAN: OK.

1939
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,740
JERRY: They make their way --

1940
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:43,199
RYAN: I say, "What did you do with Trevor?"

1941
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:45,920
"My sweet beautiful boy!"

1942
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,319
(laughter)

1943
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:49,539
AMY: You're immediately worried?

1944
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:51,100
RYAN: Yeah, I'm immediately worried about Trevor."

1945
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,160
KRIS: No you're like,

1946
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,939
"If you guys are here for Trevor, don't worry I got rid of him."

1947
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:55,699
(laughter)

1948
01:21:55,699 --> 01:21:56,840
"I took care of it." RYAN: Ah...

1949
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,119
JERRY: They come in and immediately start making their way

1950
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:03,760
up the stairs that you were halfway up. RYAN: Well I stop them. I get in their way.

1951
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,039
RYAN: And I say, "What do you guys want?"

1952
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:08,920
KATE: Can we hear this? Can we hear him talking?

1953
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,819
JERRY: Right now you are assessing this...

1954
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:14,659
You are extending your grandma-sense... KATE: OK.

1955
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:17,019
JERRY: and harvesting data. KATE: Yeah.

1956
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:18,640
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b?

1957
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:21,739
KRIS: Am I--we...uh...is my Unseen Servant

1958
01:22:21,739 --> 01:22:24,840
is he like doing laundry or is he actually useful?

1959
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,239
JERRY: He's just doing a round. KRIS: OK.

1960
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:30,119
JERRY: You basically want him to sort of walk the perimeter,

1961
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:32,800
so in my mind that means going up the backstairs....

1962
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,199
KATE: This velvet ghost, just like... JERRY: around this...

1963
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,220
JERRY: Yeah, this velvet ghost just sort of trailing around.

1964
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:40,960
The party-goers are delighted by the velvet ghost.

1965
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,039
KATE: (laughs) Of course they are. RYAN: Hmm.

1966
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:43,539
RYAN: We're gonna get extra for this one.

1967
01:22:43,539 --> 01:22:46,199
JERRY: Yeah, this is definitely a value add.

1968
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:47,359
(laughter)

1969
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:49,899
KRIS: Oh a little delight! A little party trick!

1970
01:22:49,899 --> 01:22:51,399
JERRY: Yeah exactly.

1971
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:53,199
The band's not bad...

1972
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,659
The band is definitely executing a...

1973
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:01,180
you know, entirely endurable set. KATE: OK.   AMY: Oh! (whew)

1974
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:04,500
AMY: I was like, executing a...a human? RYAN: Yeah.

1975
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,939
JERRY: Yeah, a big pile of them. They're stacked up.

1976
01:23:06,939 --> 01:23:08,759
They're just working through them from the top to the bottom.

1977
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,320
KATE: Right. I can't hear Donaar confronting anyone?

1978
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,679
Am I too focused on the party?

1979
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,960
JERRY: Yeah, this is all sort of happening around the same time.

1980
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:15,840
KATE: OK. OK.

1981
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,819
JERRY: But yeah, if it gets too loud,

1982
01:23:18,819 --> 01:23:21,639
if any of these things get too loud here,

1983
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,619
we're gonna start bringing people in and communicating.

1984
01:23:24,619 --> 01:23:25,960
KATE: OK. JERRY: Right now you're still in the kitchen,

1985
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,039
AMY: Oh yeah, I'm actually talking to the servants JERRY: at the top of the stairs.

1986
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:31,019
AMY: about how they don't need to serve the bourgeois.

1987
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:32,239
KATE: Nice.

1988
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,639
RYAN: They need to seize the means of production. KATE: Seize the means of production, yeah!

1989
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,039
JERRY: They're all in here. AMY, RYAN, &amp; KATE: Yeah.

1990
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:38,199
JERRY: These knives...

1991
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:39,519
Right? Basically you're waiting and then,

1992
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,500
you know what, every couple of minutes you see this friendly, velvet ghost...

1993
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,960
cycling around.

1994
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,819
AMY: I'm just like, "Get me out of this --" KRIS: And you let him --

1995
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:49,439
KRIS: You let me know if he's not friendly.

1996
01:23:49,979 --> 01:23:51,359
Cuz I'll have a word with him.

1997
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,420
KATE: If he has an accident, I'll clean it up.

1998
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:54,739
KRIS: Yeah. He's trying. AMY: Sounds fine...

1999
01:23:54,739 --> 01:23:56,079
RYAN: I'll hit him in front of everyone.

2000
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:57,840
(laughter) AMY: (laughs) Jesus.

2001
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,619
KRIS: No, no, no, no, no.

2002
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,520
Not my sweet Velvet.

2003
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,700
(laughter)

2004
01:24:03,699 --> 01:24:05,960
JERRY: So there's three of them here on the stairs.

2005
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:06,899
RYAN: Yeah.

2006
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:11,500
RYAN: And I...I just try to stop them. JERRY: These stairs are wide enough...

2007
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,260
JERRY: for them all to stand... RYAN: Yeah.

2008
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,960
JERRY: Like larger than shoulder-to-shoulder.

2009
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,739
JERRY: Like this is an impressive entrance here. RYAN: Yeah.

2010
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:21,680
RYAN: And I stand at the top -- JERRY: I want to emphasize

2011
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,539
JERRY: that what they're doing is very cinematic.

2012
01:24:23,539 --> 01:24:27,359
RYAN: Yeah. And I WIDEN myself as much as possible!

2013
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,619
RYAN: And I say... JERRY: Just try to catch them like this?

2014
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:31,199
RYAN: And I just say,

2015
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,840
"You guys got invitations?"

2016
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:37,459
- The left-most figure,

2017
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,920
from underneath the hat,

2018
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,239
you just sort of see a smirk.

2019
01:24:43,899 --> 01:24:46,000
And they reach back and grab a bolt

2020
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,140
and load it into a crossbow

2021
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:50,220
from inside their coat. KRIS: They're all business.   RYAN: Yeah.

2022
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,199
- And the one in the middle says,

2023
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,720
"You understand..."

2024
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,400
"what's happening here, right?"

2025
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:00,479
"You understand that you are..."

2026
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:05,880
"protecting a coven of vampires in their revels."

2027
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,960
RYAN: "I don't know anything about that, buddy."

2028
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,140
"Look I'm here to do a job and I'm doing the job. You gotta beat feet. Alright?"

2029
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,520
JERRY: "Your job is in the service of evil." RYAN: "You have to beat --"

2030
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,380
RYAN: I start yelling louder, "You have to beat feet!"

2031
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:19,619
KATE: OK.

2032
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,520
I'm not gonna come join you, because I'm not imposing whatsoever,

2033
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,260
but I am gonna get very, very close to the door and start eavesdropping on this conversation,

2034
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,579
and start maybe getting some of my shit ready.

2035
01:25:31,579 --> 01:25:33,359
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. To get you dialled in?

2036
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:34,599
KATE: I'm doing some stretches.

2037
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,920
JERRY: Yeah. I love it. Just with the stick and just...

2038
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,380
KATE: Yeah exactly. Yeah, yeah. JERRY: Alright. Just hand on.

2039
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,440
KATE: I'm creeping closer to the door and I'm on the side

2040
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:44,219
where they can't see me but I can hear everything clearly now.

2041
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:47,400
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And this is about halfway down that stair.

2042
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:50,819
But he has raised his voice to the extent that you could pick it up.

2043
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:52,019
KATE: OK. RYAN: Yeah.

2044
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:55,000
RYAN: I'm trying to make my authority known.

2045
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,600
Uh...no? Not quite.

2046
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,039
(laughter)

2047
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:01,079
AMY: Like can I? Nope, not there yet.

2048
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:04,260
KATE: But you have regular Intimidation right? RYAN: Oh yeah. I got Intimidation and Persuasion.

2049
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:07,000
KATE: OK.   AMY: So try it. RYAN: I guess I should try now before things get...

2050
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,939
KATE: Yeah. I have good Intimidation too, I can help. RYAN: before they get to a head.

2051
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:14,000
RYAN: Yeah, I'll try...I'll keep along the line that I'm doing now.

2052
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,359
Like, and try to Intimidate them.

2053
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,300
AMY: Why be nice? KRIS: Yeah, it's your job, yeah.

2054
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,500
KATE: Yeah. All business. RYAN: I'm a bouncer.

2055
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,880
KRIS: They haven't been nice to you.   KATE: Ooo. RYAN: 20. 15 + 5.

2056
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,260
RYAN: My Intimidation is very high. KATE: Yeah.

2057
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,539
JERRY: It is.   AMY: High enough? KRIS: Nice.   KATE: Nice.

2058
01:26:29,779 --> 01:26:31,939
KRIS: (whispers) No. Last week. AMY: Oh sorry.

2059
01:26:31,939 --> 01:26:33,000
KRIS: That's not this time.

2060
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,500
JERRY: So you're continuing in your quest? KATE: Oh yeah. Bring that roleplay.

2061
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,300
RYAN: I'm just browbeating them and trying to tell them they're not welcome there.

2062
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,380
Invoking the authority...

2063
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,100
JERRY: Vested in you. RYAN: that is...

2064
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,640
RYAN: Donaar the Dragonborn. KATE: Yeah.

2065
01:26:48,739 --> 01:26:51,920
RYAN: More important than the three of them combined.

2066
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,140
How amazing I am. JERRY: Right.

2067
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:56,520
RYAN: And then I name drop AI.  JERRY: Yeah exactly.

2068
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,520
JERRY: The figure on the left

2069
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,300
reaches into the top part of their cloak

2070
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:06,480
and pulls out a holy symbol

2071
01:27:07,899 --> 01:27:12,479
and looks at your own holy symbol and says,

2072
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:15,179
"A paladin in the service of vampires?"

2073
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,980
RYAN: "I don't know anything about any vampires."

2074
01:27:17,979 --> 01:27:19,979
KRIS: (laughs) RYAN: "I haven't seen any vampires."

2075
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,980
"I just see a bunch of people having a good old time."

2076
01:27:22,979 --> 01:27:25,399
"And you're here to be a party pooper."

2077
01:27:25,399 --> 01:27:27,119
"And I don't like party poopers."

2078
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:29,000
KRIS: I see him... RYAN: "Sir."

2079
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,819
KRIS: up the stairs pull out that holy symbol and I just think,

2080
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:33,340
"Oh. Party foul."

2081
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,420
(laughter)

2082
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:36,779
JERRY: No...   RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: That simply isn't done.

2083
01:27:36,779 --> 01:27:38,359
AMY: But then you look in your cloak

2084
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:40,079
and you're like looking at your own icon, like,

2085
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:41,420
"It's nice, though."

2086
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,619
(laughter)

2087
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:44,460
JERRY: It'll do. It'll do in a pinch.

2088
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,660
AMY: "I wish I could show it off."

2089
01:27:45,659 --> 01:27:47,599
JERRY: Your Alarm blares.

2090
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,800
KRIS: Oh ok.

2091
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
KATE: So this 20 didn't do anything... KRIS: So all of you also hear it.

2092
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,860
KATE: to those vampire hunters? His intimidation.

2093
01:27:53,859 --> 01:27:56,279
JERRY: It might have affected one or more of them. KATE: I see.

2094
01:27:56,279 --> 01:27:58,500
JERRY: They certainly aren't trying to murder him. KATE: OK.

2095
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,319
JERRY: But it is at this moment that your veranda Alarm goes off.

2096
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:07,779
KRIS: You all also hear it, but I'm gonna go ahead and head over to the veranda.

2097
01:28:07,779 --> 01:28:10,319
KATE: OK. KRIS: Where it was set.

2098
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:15,859
KRIS: Is there any--like is it-- what's the entrance way look like?

2099
01:28:15,859 --> 01:28:18,139
KRIS: Are there curtains for me to throw open dramtically?

2100
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:21,140
JERRY: Abso--if you'd like to. I mean, right now they're sort of...

2101
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:24,940
right now they're sort of pulled a little bit around each of those three double doors.

2102
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:27,379
KRIS: Oh I see, I see. JERRY: Mostly in a decorative tie.

2103
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,600
KRIS: Sure yeah. Cleave right through that. JERRY: Golden...

2104
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,940
JERRY: Yeah exactly (growls) KRIS: That's not gonna do anything!

2105
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:32,539
KRIS: No wonder they had so much trouble here.

2106
01:28:32,539 --> 01:28:33,359
JERRY: Yeah exactly.

2107
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:36,139
But yeah, the Alarm has gone out

2108
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:38,619
and between those cracks you're not able to --

2109
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,239
it's not clear what's out there. (die clatters)

2110
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,500
KRIS: I tear open the curtains dramatically!

2111
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,979
JERRY: Yeah. (laughter)

2112
01:28:43,979 --> 01:28:45,479
KATE: The jig is up. RYAN: That was a 1!

2113
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,619
RYAN: I strangle myself with the rope. KRIS: I tie it a little tighter!

2114
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:50,680
KRIS: And then I try to look. JERRY: You don't see anything.

2115
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,600
KRIS: Oh? Uh oh.

2116
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,140
I don't like that.

2117
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,500
Shoot. Awakened Mind isn't gonna do anything cuz I can only speak to visible creatures. OK.

2118
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,539
- You're fucked!

2119
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:04,579
- "Me not like."

2120
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:06,699
KATE: OK. KRIS: I say to the...

2121
01:29:06,699 --> 01:29:09,260
(laughter) JERRY: To the rock?   KRIS: It's in my pocket.

2122
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:10,699
JERRY: It's common? KRIS: "Oh...me not like."

2123
01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:12,300
RYAN: Me no likey.

2124
01:29:14,859 --> 01:29:17,479
- Any movement of the other curtains?

2125
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:19,019
Or they're closed still?

2126
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,820
- All three of the doors are closed.

2127
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:23,639
RYAN: Reinforce them. (laughs)

2128
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,840
- Strange.

2129
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,260
RYAN: Was anyone out on the veranda?

2130
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:29,360
- Yeah, am I seeing even...

2131
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:33,319
RYAN: Like party goers? KRIS: anybody actually here other than this Alarm?

2132
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:36,939
JERRY: No, no. The party has not extended out to the veranda.

2133
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,460
RYAN: Alright. Lock the doors.

2134
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,400
KRIS: Hold on a second...

2135
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:44,380
Am I gonna get anything out of Perception or Arcana?

2136
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:46,239
Why my Alarm would have gone off.

2137
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,139
Can I do an Arcana on that?

2138
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:52,079
JERRY: You know exactly why because you literally created this spell.

2139
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:55,380
And then you know, ruby red spurs...

2140
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:58,500
launched from the sky and created a zone

2141
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,119
JERRY: Where... KRIS: Oh yeah.

2142
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:02,800
JERRY: You know exactly why. There's no need to roll.

2143
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,119
KRIS: But OK I told it to find -- JERRY: Something is --

2144
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:08,000
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: Exactly. You created a 20-foot cube volume...

2145
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,880
that ensconces this area. It has been tripped.

2146
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:14,159
KRIS: Let me see if I can perceive this person.

2147
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,840
It seems like there's nobody here right now.

2148
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,980
(die clatters) KRIS: (blows raspberry) That's not gonna work.

2149
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:21,119
Uh yeah it's garbage. It's 11.

2150
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:23,140
Oh sorry. It's less than that.

2151
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,660
AMY: Can I pop my head out at this point and be like,

2152
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:30,159
"Thriss. What's the deal? I heard the Alarm." JERRY: Ooo I like Thriss as a nickname.

2153
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:34,460
KRIS: I secretly also like it. But I don't (stammers)

2154
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:35,939
Back to business.

2155
01:30:35,939 --> 01:30:38,899
It's like when Kanye thinks of something funny. He's like, "Haha..."

2156
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:41,360
(laughter) And it's real hard.

2157
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,359
"The Alarm went off but I don't see anybody out here."

2158
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:48,659
"Even with my...low-light vision."

2159
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:52,100
KRIS: Try with yours. KATE: What do your Elf eyes see?

2160
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:54,360
KRIS: Maybe your Elven--oh I see. I like that very much!

2161
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:57,079
KATE: (laughs) AMY: Wow. You should write that down.

2162
01:30:57,079 --> 01:30:58,779
KRIS: You play me for right now.

2163
01:30:58,779 --> 01:31:00,079
KRIS: You'll do an even better job. AMY: So I'm assuming if I looked

2164
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:01,859
AMY: I wouldn't see anything either,

2165
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:04,019
But if I did Detect Magic...

2166
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:08,420
could I sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of me...

2167
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:13,560
I would see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears any magic.

2168
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,620
KRIS: Oh visible, though.

2169
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:16,380
KATE: Yeah, visible's the trick. JERRY: Yeah, visible's the key.

2170
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,840
KATE: Yeah. AMY: Hmm...

2171
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,539
JERRY: It doesn't give you X-Ray vision. AMY: Oh around any visible creature. I see.

2172
01:31:20,539 --> 01:31:23,420
KATE: Is there any flour we could sprinkle? AMY: But I'd still be able to sense

2173
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:25,920
if there was some magic going on, I would know the school of magic.

2174
01:31:26,859 --> 01:31:29,119
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'd know there was something out there.

2175
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:31,479
AMY: Is there anything out there? RYAN: Also the Alarm's going off. So that tells that...

2176
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:31,979
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2177
01:31:31,979 --> 01:31:33,019
JERRY: We know that something's out there. KRIS: Actually you know what...

2178
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:33,700
JERRY: That part's clear.

2179
01:31:33,699 --> 01:31:35,920
KRIS: Faerie Fire would help here. RYAN: Lock the door.

2180
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,020
KATE: What does Faerie Fire do? JERRY: Yeah!

2181
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,420
RYAN: (garbled line) JERRY: Hey!

2182
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:39,840
RYAN: "Would you lock the door?"

2183
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,260
I say--I go to the three guys.

2184
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:42,520
KRIS: "Oh I'm sorry what?"

2185
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,540
RYAN: I go to the three guys. I go, KRIS: You just threw me...

2186
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,740
"You three look like vampires to me."

2187
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:49,859
"And I don't want to let you in here to disrupt these nice people."

2188
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,359
"I'm gonna turn my head right now..."

2189
01:31:52,359 --> 01:31:55,739
"And if any of you fucking sucker punch me, I'm gonna be so pissed off."

2190
01:31:55,739 --> 01:31:57,439
And I turn to the ver--

2191
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:00,199
And I say, "Lock the door! I hear the Alarm in my head. Lock the door!"

2192
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:03,139
KRIS: OK. KATE: Yeah, can we push tables up against the doors?

2193
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,579
KATE: To barricade them maybe?

2194
01:32:05,579 --> 01:32:08,140
KRIS: I dunno, then we'd wanna alarm the guests.

2195
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:09,880
AMY: No, we don't wanna mess up the party. JERRY: Yeah, I was gonna say that's...

2196
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,180
KATE: Yeah, that's a party pooper move.

2197
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:14,360
KRIS: We're supposed to take care of this...yeah, quietly. So Faerie Fire...

2198
01:32:14,359 --> 01:32:16,079
JERRY: As quiet as possible. KRIS: Yeah.

2199
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:19,960
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light...

2200
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,260
My choice!

2201
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,260
KATE: Ooo. RYAN: Cool.

2202
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,400
KRIS: Any creature in the area when the spell is cast

2203
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:25,799
KRIS: is also outlined in light KATE: (gasps)

2204
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,579
KRIS: if it fails a Dex saving throw.

2205
01:32:27,579 --> 01:32:28,859
KATE: What? JERRY: I'm ready.

2206
01:32:28,859 --> 01:32:30,279
KRIS: Alright so...

2207
01:32:30,279 --> 01:32:32,599
KATE: That's tight! KRIS: So go ahead and fail that throw.

2208
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:33,780
(laughter)

2209
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:36,079
KRIS: I go ahead and I do cast Faerie Fire.

2210
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:38,820
JERRY: K.

2211
01:32:39,899 --> 01:32:43,379
KRIS: How we feeling about that? KATE: Is it--your spell DC's 13? Probably?

2212
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:45,199
KIRS: Yes...it is.

2213
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:49,619
JERRY: So...as you cast the spell,

2214
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:59,079
instantly you see a source of light above the...

2215
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:02,720
Here's the veranda here, and you see the glow of it

2216
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,940
cast down from a higher position.

2217
01:33:05,939 --> 01:33:07,239
KRIS: They're in the ducts.

2218
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,280
KATE: OK. RYAN: (quack quack)

2219
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:10,800
KATE: So they're hovering -- (laughter)

2220
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,860
KATE: they're flying above in the night sky somewhere?

2221
01:33:12,859 --> 01:33:14,880
JERRY: Basically they're not on the veranda,

2222
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,579
JERRY: but they are above it. KATE: OK.

2223
01:33:16,579 --> 01:33:17,600
KRIS: Maybe on the roof, KATE: On the roof?

2224
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,880
KRIS: or on the eaves or something.

2225
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,920
AMY: OK so do I see this? RYAN: On the rough.

2226
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,680
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you're looking out this window, you can see that this is against the...

2227
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,220
KATE: It's glowing. JERRY: This light is shining against the...

2228
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:33,860
AMY: Alright. So then I look at K'thriss

2229
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:36,239
and I start doing hand signals.

2230
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:37,340
I'm like...

2231
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:39,559
RYAN: (laughs) Yeah... (laughter)

2232
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,440
AMY: You.

2233
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:41,219
Here.

2234
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:42,240
Whatever.

2235
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:43,779
I don't care. (laughter)

2236
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:45,199
KRIS: (whispers) "Not now."

2237
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,039
KRIS: "Alright. Later." AMY: But basically --

2238
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:49,539
AMY: But basically I say like, "OK I'm gonna go up there."

2239
01:33:49,539 --> 01:33:52,140
And then at this point I would want to...

2240
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,500
AMY: Turn into my spider. JERRY: Transform into the beast?

2241

01:33:56,199 --> 01:33:57,859
AMY: Wild Shape into the spider. RYAN: (laughs) In the middle of the party.

2243
01:33:57,859 --> 01:33:59,519
AMY: No, no! I'm gonna take it on the veranda.

2244
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,580
JERRY: I love this! I like this.

2245
01:34:00,579 --> 01:34:03,559
AMY: And then I want to start -- RYAN: You don't want to alarm anyone (hisses)

2246
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,740
KATE: They would probably be way into it. Are you kidding me?

2247
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:06,619
If a spider starts walking around a vampire party?

2248
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:07,979
AMY: Yeah, like with a tray. KATE: Yeah.   RYAN: Yeah.

2249
01:34:08,859 --> 01:34:12,659
KRIS: If anybody's upset I'll just poke back in and I'm like, "Enjoy friends! Enjoy!"

2250
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:13,519
JERRY: It's their fault.

2251
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,420
AMY: You put a velvet thing on me. RYAN: Put velvet on it. Yeah and they'd love it!

2252
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:17,380
(laughter)

2253
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:19,840
AMY: So I wanna turn into a spider and I can just climb...

2254
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,699
JERRY: For you that's a bonus action. AMY: Right the hell up...Yeah.

2255
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:23,979
JERRY: So basically you walk out onto the...

2256
01:34:23,979 --> 01:34:25,739
AMY: Mmhmm. Veranda. JERRY: You walk out onto the veranda,

2257
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:27,399
JERRY: close the door behind you (click)

2258
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:28,659
JERRY: and then... AMY: (whispers) Transform into a spider.

2259
01:34:28,659 --> 01:34:30,460
JERRY: transform into a spider.

2260
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,340
JERRY: Bulbous. AMY: Mmm.   RYAN: Yeah.

01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,739
JERRY: Ready to work. KRIS: Everything you wanted.   KATE: Carapace...?

2262
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:38,179
JERRY: Exactly right. AMY: Just shining and glistening and excellent.

2263
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:41,760
JERRY: And those blue-green lights

2264
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,500
are just glinting off of your bulbous abdomen.

2265
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,000
KRIS: (whispers) Oh yeah!

2266
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,079
AMY: She's like a SENSUAL-looking spider.

2267
01:34:49,079 --> 01:34:50,340
RYAN: It's a thick spider.

2268
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:52,739
JERRY: It's the full meal deal. RYAN: Two C's. Thicc.

2269
01:34:52,739 --> 01:34:54,539
KRIS: I'm not a Lolth guy but...

2270
01:34:54,539 --> 01:34:55,939
(appreciative sound)

2271
01:34:55,939 --> 01:34:57,439
JERRY: You know? Hey!

2272
01:34:57,439 --> 01:34:59,719
KRIS: Yeah I get it. JERRY: You get it! You understand it.

2273
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,640
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: (laughs) You're not a Lolth guy.

2274
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:04,079
JERRY: But that's exactly what it is. So you go there, turn,

2275
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,819
and then immediately just skitter to face up.

2276
01:35:08,819 --> 01:35:12,179
And that is when she leaps.

2277
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:13,899
AMY: OK. KATE: (whispers) She leaps!

2278
01:35:13,899 --> 01:35:16,159
JERRY: So let's get some Initiative.

2279
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,779
Just in case we need it.

2280
01:35:17,779 --> 01:35:18,840
KATE: For everyone? JERRY: Mmhmm.

2281
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,020
AMY: Y'all like when I just aggro everything every game? Sorry about that.

2282
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,960
AMY: I'm like, "I'm gonna turn into an animal!" JERRY: I love it!

2283
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,500
KATE: Leeroy Jenkins this shit. AMY: 20!

2284
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:26,539
KRIS: Ooo. Lucky. AMY: Wait. 23.

2285
01:35:26,539 --> 01:35:28,880
JERRY: Goddamn, Walnut. KATE: (gasp) 21.   RYAN: 12.

2286
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,220
JERRY: Mmhmm. RYAN: That's better than my normal single digit.

2287
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:36,060
JERRY: Yeah! KRIS: I'm gonna just take in the scene with a 3.

2288
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:37,220
(laughter)

2289
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:38,500
KATE: How did you even do that? AMY: Jesus.

2290
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,460
KRIS: I don't know... KAT: What's your Initiative bonus?

2291
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:40,920
KRIS: +2. I rolled a 1, yeah. AMY: K'thriss takes a nap.

2292
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,380
RYAN: Oh God. KATE: That is very bad.

2293
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:43,819
RYAN: Enemies always go before me. KRIS: "Get her!"

2294
01:35:43,819 --> 01:35:46,259
JERRY: Just savor it. Just savor it.

2295
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,680
AMY: Well you did the Faerie Fire.

2296
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,820
KRIS: Yeah. That's true.

2297
01:35:48,819 --> 01:35:49,759
KATE: You're tuckered out. KRIS: I've done (laughs)

2298
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,600
KRIS: I've done my part.

2299
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,940
JERRY: Straight down from the roof.

2300
01:35:53,939 --> 01:35:56,460
Right--ugh. Goddamn it.

2301
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,600
AMY: Nice! Those are the kind of rolls that I like. KATE: She thought she was gonna do a sick bite...

2302
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:03,240
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Tried to do a bite. Was not capable of it.

2303
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:04,599
KATE: (laughs) How do you bite a spider?

2304
01:36:06,439 --> 01:36:08,779
RYAN: It starts jumping when you were in human form...

2305
01:36:08,779 --> 01:36:10,099
JERYR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just jumps down...

2306
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,039
Yeah it's like, "Oh I got this in the fucking bag!"

2307
01:36:12,039 --> 01:36:13,560
And then POOF! "The fuck?!"

2308
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,820
(laughter)

2309
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:18,680
So...coming down, knife is coming back...

2310
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,640
AMY: Mmhmm. JERRY: going down...

2311
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,320
JERRY: Four legs just, "No."

2312
01:36:21,319 --> 01:36:22,759
KATE: (laughs)   KRIS: Nice. AMY: Amazing.

2313
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,199
JERRY: "I don't think so."

2314
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:28,099
KRIS: You get Advantage because of Faerie Fire. JERRY: "Not this."   KATE: Four legs?

2315
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,320
KATE: Did you say four legs?   JERRY: Four legs. AMY: I do get Advantage, you're right.

2316
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:30,539
KATE: Oh, her four legs. JERRY: Yeah.

2317
01:36:30,539 --> 01:36:32,659
KATE: Oh OK. I thought you said the creature had four legs.

2318
01:36:32,659 --> 01:36:34,000
KATE: So I was like, "A centaur?" JERRY: Oh shit!

2319
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,600
JERRY: The fuck is this? RYAN: Oh (laughs)

2320
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,220
JERRY: That's some crazy as door!

2321
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,260
KRIS: Four four legs. AMY: Centaurs are hot, though.

2322
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:42,400
KATE: Yeah, I would pay to watch this. JERRY: Yeah, centaurs is hot, for real.

2323
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:46,839
JERRY: So exactly, so now this has immediately happened.

2324
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:54,560
Your assailant is now flat against the...veranda.

2325
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,780
And it is your turn.

2326
01:36:55,779 --> 01:36:58,519
AMY: Well I have absolutely no way to communicate with them,

2327
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,280
which would normally be my move.

2328
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:02,739
JERRY: As a spider? KATE: You could communicate with bites.

2329
01:37:02,739 --> 01:37:04,260
AMY: Yeah, I was gonna say I'm like...

2330
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:06,380
JERRY: Yeah, the immortal language.

2331
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,460
RYAN: Venom.   KATE: Universal. AMY: Here's something I can do. I'm gonna --

2332
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:11,199
RYAN: Venom. The ultimate language. JERRY: Communicate with their veins.

01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:12,599
KATE: Can you Web as a spider?

2334
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,720
AMY: Oh I can, but it has a recharge so I wanna hold it

2335
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,600
AMY: because I could AOE some little butts. KATE: Sure, sure. OK.

2336
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,200
KATE: OK. AMY: Little butts in the other room.

2337
01:37:20,199 --> 01:37:22,460
KATE: So, stupid question. She killed a horse with the Web.

2338
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:23,840
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: 'Course (laughs)

2339
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,360
AMY: Now...I slowed down a cart with a Web.

01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:27,619
That's what happened.,

2341
01:37:27,619 --> 01:37:29,059
KRIS: It's more, really. KATE: That's a spin.

2342
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:32,660
KRIS: After it's gone through the PR team, that's how it's written out.

2343
01:37:32,659 --> 01:37:35,099
(laughter) RYAN: Yeah, wag the dog--wag the spider?

2344
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,600
AMY: Thank you. OK so I'm going to... JERRY: It's a spinneret.

2345
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,920
go ahead and try to bite.

2346
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,659
AMY: And because I have Faerie Fire, I have Advantage. KRIS: Yes.

2347
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:45,359
KATE: Oh! That's awesome. JERRY: Yeah, they're chewy.

2348
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,960
AMY: Mmhmm. KATE: That's so cool.

2349
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,800
AMY: That is a 16 + 5 would be a 21.

2350
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,480
But let's just see--Oh! That is a...

2351
01:37:51,479 --> 01:37:53,099

2352
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,780
RYAN: Natural 20.   KATE: Ooo. JERRY: A natural 20, you say?

2353
01:37:54,779 --> 01:37:55,399
KATE: Isn't there something that happens --

01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:56,839
AMY: Didn't I just crit on an attack? RYAN: No. Next week.

2370
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:23,940
AMY: And then it's... KRIS: I hear a fang against the floorboard.

2371
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:27,859

KRIS: Oh my God. (laughter)

01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,500
JERRY: The fangs!

2379
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,819
The fangs just straight through.

2380
01:38:46,819 --> 01:38:51,019
There's just two pops as the leather armor is pierced.

2381
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:55,680
And then there's that rush as the venom pumps from the sacs.

2382
01:38:56,319 --> 01:38:58,139
AMY: More sexual though. JERRY: Yeah, exactly.   RYAN: Yes. Yeah.

AMY: OK.

01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,600
JERRY: Straight in and a few shudders

2385
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:05,440
and you withdraw the fangs.

2386
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,979
This person is completely gone.

2387
01:39:07,979 --> 01:39:09,539
AMY: I knock her off the veranda. JERRY: Yeah.

2388
01:39:09,539 --> 01:39:11,500
AMY: Just kidding! I don't do that. I don't do that.

2389
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,159
KRIS: I think I'm a thorax guy now. KATE: Gotta loot her first.

2390
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:16,500
JERRY: Yeah, you know what? KRIS: I think I might be a thorax guy...

2391
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:19,180
JERRY: You just need to meet the right spider? RYAN &amp; KRIS: Yeah.

2392
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,380
KRIS: I've seen that book lung...

2393
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:23,000

2394
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,180
"Oh my god!"

2395
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:25,200
KATE: Whoo! KRIS: "Interesting!"

2396
01:39:25,699 --> 01:39:27,000
JERRY: It's hot stuff. RYAN: Hubba hubba.

2397
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,739
AMY: Walnut turns around and just looks at you like...

2398
01:39:28,739 --> 01:39:29,960
(laughter)

2399
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,920
AMY: It's not for you. JERRY: (laughs) Yeah.

2400
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,920
JERRY: This is not your thorax. RYAN: Yeah.

2401
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,239
KATE: There's nothing else that's illuminated on the veranda?

2402
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,779
JERRY: Nothing you could see. KATE: That was the single threat?

2403
01:39:37,779 --> 01:39:38,960
JERRY: Mmhmm. KATE: OK.

2404
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:44,640
KATE: I assume that the bad--the vampire hunters have not engaged in combat yet?

2405
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,140
JERRY: Not out front. KATE: OK.

2406
01:39:46,739 --> 01:39:47,599
KATE: Not out front?

2407
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,860
JERRY: (stutters) the ones that are on the... KATE: Right.

2408
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:51,639
RYAN: Front door. JERRY: Basically that happened on the veranda,

2409
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,760
this is out the front door of the performance space.

2410
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,720
AMY: (laughs) Trying to trip him up on his words. KRIS: Oh right, right.

2411
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:56,980
KATE: Oh yeah? Not out the front, huh?

2412
01:39:56,979 --> 01:39:58,179
JERRY: Oh yeah? Four legs?

2413
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:00,500
KRIS: The ones who are engaged with... KATE: Killer centaurs!   JERRY: Exactly.

2414
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,579
AMY, RYAN &amp; KRIS: Donaar.

2415
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,500
RYAN: We're having a friendly chat.

2416
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:04,560
JERRY: Vampire centaurs!

2417
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,660
KATE: So my question is, we have --

2418
01:40:05,659 --> 01:40:08,420
we are in a fighting order... what are we fighting?

2419
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:12,199
JERRY: This is just in case we need -- KATE: Oh I see.

2420
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:13,539
KATE: Ok so we're back to free actions?

2421
01:40:13,539 --> 01:40:15,519
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. You can do what you need.

2422
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,500
JERRY: For me, for my purpose, I need to know how this is gonna go.

2423
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:21,180
KRIS: And I'm...obviously the Alarm went off...

2424
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:24,240
and then I Awakened Mind to each of you, like,

2425
01:40:25,899 --> 01:40:27,539
"Walnut just killed a guy out here."

2426
01:40:27,539 --> 01:40:29,300
KRIS: "Killed an interloper." KATE: "Tight."

2427
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,579
KATE: "Good job, Walnut. Nice." KRIS: "It was on the roof."

2428
01:40:30,579 --> 01:40:32,840
RYAN: I yell, "You killed a person on the veranda?!"

2429
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,260
(laughter) RYAN: Like in front of the three guys.

2430
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:36,280
KRIS: "And don't yell it." RYAN: "Awesome!"

2431
01:40:36,279 --> 01:40:37,539
(laughter)

2432
01:40:37,539 --> 01:40:39,560
RYAN: "That's so cool!"

2433
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:42,780
KRIS: "I can hear your mind but I can hear you yelling from out here."

2434
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:44,559
(laughter) "Don't yell about a murder."

2435
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,000
KATE: "I can't hear anything going out of your mind. It's like there's nothing there."

2436
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,739
KATE: "It's like it's just empty." AMY: And then in your mind...

2437
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,180
AMY: you hear...(wet squelching sounds)

2438
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,420
JERRY: Just playing? RYAN: (chittering sounds)

2439
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:55,480
KATE: (laughs) AMY: (squelching sounds)

2440
01:40:55,539 --> 01:40:59,239
KRIS: Yeah, we were never clear about whether or not Awakened Mind was two-way.

2441
01:40:59,239 --> 01:41:00,219
And I've been playing it one-way.

2442
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,820
KATE: We clarified it. KRIS: Oh was it clarified?

2443
01:41:01,819 --> 01:41:03,159
KATE: With Chris Perkins. KRIS: It's one-way, OK.

2444
01:41:03,159 --> 01:41:04,319
KATE: No, he said two-way.

2445
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:06,099
KRIS: Is it really? KATE: Yeah. He said two-way. I was there.

2446
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:07,360
RYAN: TV's Chris Perkins. AMY: It goes both ways.

2447
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:09,000
KATE: Yeah. It goes both ways. JERRY: Yeah, he would know.

2448
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,119
KRIS: One and a half-ways. RYAN: Hehe. Nice.

2449
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:11,199
KATE: OK. JERRY: Thanks, Chris Perkins.

2450
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:16,179
KATE: I'm going to...I slowly sidle my way out of the room.

2451
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:17,140
JERRY: Mmhmm. KATE: And...

2452
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:21,680
KATE: in the most menacing way possible for someone who's three foot two,

2453
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:27,220
I come up behind Donaar, and I say, leaning on my quarterstaff, and I'm like,

2454
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,880
"Is there a problem here?"

2455
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:31,880
RYAN: "No, our friends are just leaving, as a matter of fact."

2456
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,020
KATE: "That's good. I'm really happy to hear that." RYAN: "Yeah."

2457
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:37,039
RYAN: The end.

2458
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:39,859
(laughtr) RYAN: And I say, "Meh..."

2459
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:41,759
KATE: Can I --   KRIS: I like... RYAN: "Beat feet!"

2460
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,820
KRIS: And they can't take action cuz it's not their turn.

2461
01:41:43,819 --> 01:41:46,799
RYAN: Yeah.   JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: So they're like, "I got to wait for..."

2462
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,079
KATE: They're like, "Mmm I'm gonna have a really good response to that."

2463
01:41:49,079 --> 01:41:54,659
Can I do an Intimidation against them to try to drive them back down the stairs, in addition to his 20?

2464
01:41:54,659 --> 01:41:56,279
KRIS: Mmm. JERRY: You can try to...

2465
01:41:56,279 --> 01:41:58,719
These guys are pretty cranked up but let's see what happens.

2466
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:01,079
KATE: OK. (die clatters) That's a 9.

2467
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:02,260
JERRY &amp; KRIS: Mmm.

2468
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,680
JERRY: No. KATE: My voice cracks in the middle of it.

2469
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,800
KATE: I'm like, "You better (voice cracks) get out of this party."

2470
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,000
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. "You know well (voice cracks) you're not wanted here."

2471
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,659
KATE: "(voice cracks) This isn't a party for you."

2472
01:42:10,659 --> 01:42:14,059
JERRY: No, you think it's entirely possible that before you came out,

2473
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:16,800
Donnar had the effect on them that he has on most people.

2474
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,720
KATE: Infuriating. Great.

2475
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,400
KATE: Cool. RYAN: Intimidating.

2476
01:42:21,399 --> 01:42:23,859
AMY &amp; KATE: Well... RYAN: I've established the pecking order (laughs)

2477
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,100
KATE: Well, not yet.

2478
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,620
JERRY: But... AMY: Well...

2479
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,980
JERRY: So when it comes down to them

2480
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:33,439
He puts his...

2481
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:38,340
The figure on the left puts their holy symbol back in

2482
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:41,500
to their...back underneath their leather cloak.

2483
01:42:41,899 --> 01:42:42,939
And says,

2484
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,279
"I'll extend you the same offer."

2485
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,280
"You can leave now."

2486
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:54,000
RYAN: To me? To both of us.

2487
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,300
JERRY: "You can leave now and remain whole."

2488
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:57,140
KATE: OK.

2489
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,800
RYAN: "Uh...quick moment."

2490
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,600
RYAN: And huddle up. KATE: Yeah.

2491
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,620
RYAN: I say, "That's a great offer. That is a good offer."

2492
01:43:05,619 --> 01:43:08,059
KATE: "We'll talk. Give us just a minute." RYAN: "Just one second."

2493
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:09,240
RYAN: Huddle up. KATE: Yeah.

2494
01:43:09,239 --> 01:43:12,619
KRIS: Can I add people to the call? RYAN: And I go like, "Kris!"

2495
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:13,779
JERRY: Yeah exactly. Yeah, yeah. RYAN: "Kris, get over here!"

2496
01:43:13,779 --> 01:43:15,039
JERRY: Add-in.   KATE: Conference call. RYAN: "Kris, get in."

2497
01:43:15,039 --> 01:43:16,739
KATE: Kris, can you hear us? JERRY: Add friend!

2498
01:43:16,739 --> 01:43:18,199
KATE: Oh great. RYAN: "K'thriss!"   KRIS: Yeah.

2499
01:43:18,199 --> 01:43:19,979
KRIS: No, I get great signal. I got -- RYAN: Yeah.

2500
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:22,500
KATE: (laughs)   JERRY: Five bars! RYAN: "Bring the velvet ghost."

2501
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,119
RYAN: "Maybe that'll scare 'em."

2502
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:25,599
KRIS: I don't know about that.

2503
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,060
AMY: And then "(squelching sounds)" RYAN: Yeah. (chittering sounds)

2504
01:43:28,199 --> 01:43:32,399
KRIS: OK let's...I still have Alarm active.

2505
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:34,960
So I'm gonna jet in there.

2506
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,500
How far can I make it?

2507
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,619
At my regular speed.

2508
01:43:38,819 --> 01:43:40,840
KRIS: Or we not even in there at the moment? JERRY: It's 30 feet.

2509
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:44,239
JERRY: You can get to the top of the doors and look down.

2510
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:46,840
JERRY: From where you were by the interior doors. KRIS: OK.

2511
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,260
KRIS: Yeah, let me go ahead and do that. I'm ready to... RYAN: Alright.

2512
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,500
RYAN: So you're over there with us too?

2513
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,699
AMY: Can I crawl around... JERRY: Yeah, he's at the top,

2514
01:43:52,699 --> 01:43:54,679
JERRY: you guys are at the middle of the stairs. KRIS: OK.

2515
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:57,400
JERRY: You can do as you like. AMY: I was gonna say, "Can I crawl around the outside?"

2516
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:58,899
AMY: And then -- JERRY: And wide look in?

2517
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:00,279
AMY: block their exit?

2518
01:44:00,279 --> 01:44:03,960
AMY: I don't want to alarm the party-goers. JERRY: That is so gross!   KRIS: Yeah.

2519
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,159
AMY: Yeah so they just look back

2520
01:44:05,159 --> 01:44:06,119
AMY: and all they just see eyes. KATE: You nasty!

2521
01:44:06,119 --> 01:44:07,180
JERRY: I hate this!

2522
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:08,920
AMY: I just stay awake at night and think,

2523
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:10,880
"How can I scare people with my spider?"

2524
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,239
JERRY: Dude, I hate this so much.

2525
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:15,859
So basically you're just gonna go straight off the veranda,

2526
01:44:15,859 --> 01:44:17,960
AMY: Mmm.  KRIS: Ooo yeah.  JERRY: straight around the side,

2527
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,560
JERRY: climb right down the front

2528
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:20,940
and just wait at the front door?

2529
01:44:20,939 --> 01:44:24,699
AMY: Yeah... (squelching sounds) KATE: I have goosebumps from how nasty you are.

2530
01:44:24,699 --> 01:44:27,380
KRIS: "That's a great move." RYAN: I was gonna suggest, yeah, a flanking maneuver.

2531
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:29,079
AMY: Just clicking my little palps. RYAN: OK. Alright,

2532
01:44:29,079 --> 01:44:31,079
RYAN: so I turn to the guys and I say,

2533
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:32,420
"It was a good offer..."

2534
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:35,699
"And I will offer you the same thing I offered Trevor."

2535
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:37,779
"And that you can leave right now..."

2536
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:40,139
"or I'll bash your head in."

2537
01:44:41,619 --> 01:44:42,739
KATE: Nice.

2538
01:44:42,739 --> 01:44:44,639
KATE: I like that, "He will!" RYAN: Yeah.

2539
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,619
KATE: I back him up. I'm like,

2540
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:47,519
KATE: "He'll totally do it. I've seen him do it." RYAN: "Yeah, I'm crazy."

2541
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,520
KATE: "Yeah."

2542
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,560
RYAN: "You don't want to fuck with me, man. I'm crazy." KATE: "Yeah."

2543
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:51,920
KRIS: OK uh... KATE: "He's insane."

2544
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:55,180
RYAN: "And I'm desperate for money." KATE: "I will let him off the leash."

2545
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:57,020
KRIS: Have I...? KATE: "I got him on a short leash right now,"

2546
01:44:57,020 --> 01:44:58,480
KATE: "but I will let him go."

2547
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:00,500
KRIS: This is a long shot...

2548
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,159
You'll recognize it.

2549
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:06,859
But I Awakened Mind to the attacker --

2550
01:45:06,859 --> 01:45:09,059
KRIS: the potential attacker that he's addressing. JERRY: Yeah.

2551
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:12,180
KRIS: And I just think at him very quietly,

2552
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,000
"Oh shit. This guy's serious."

2553
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,720
(laughter)

2554
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:20,820
RYAN: He's not playing around. KRIS: Yeah, so maybe he'll think it's his subconscious.

2555
01:45:20,819 --> 01:45:22,639
AMY: (laughs) KATE: Yeah, his Jiminy Cricket.

2556
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,140
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: Uh oh.

2557
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:26,380
JERRY: That's... KRIS: "I'm really scared."

2558
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:31,300
JERRY: That does not have... That does not have the effect...

2559
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,520
KRIS: Dangit. JERRY: that you're looking for.

2560
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,440
KATE: It was a beautiful try.

2561
01:45:34,439 --> 01:45:38,279
KRIS: "I feel really dumb standing up here right now. I should go home."

2562
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:42,399
KATE: I'm hungry. JERRY: Yeah, yeah. It's a single movement

2563
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:43,460
RYAN: Oh...

2564
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:48,779
JERRY: At the second sentence, the second psychic manipulation attempt,

2565
01:45:48,779 --> 01:45:51,219
AMY: Goddamn it. JERRY: it's a single movement

2566
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:55,420
of the hand underneath the cloak.

2567
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:59,140
The sword comes out and strikes at the same time.

2568
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:01,520
KATE: Whoa.   RYAN: Hmm. AMY: Fuck you, buddy.

2569
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,460
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Yeah, we're just talking here.

2570
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:05,560
RYAN: Jeez. It's a party. KATE: I guess we did threaten him.

2571
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,300
KATE: To bash his head in. RYAN: He threatened first!

2572
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:08,840
JERRY: Oh no! AMY: They're breaking and entering!

2573
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,319
KRIS: Uh oh. What do you got? RYAN: Dammit. Why do I get all the bad hits?

2574
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:12,219
AMY: You're the big boy!

2575
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:13,780
KATE: You're a very big boy. AMY: You're a big, big boy.

2576
01:46:13,779 --> 01:46:17,380
JERRY: Why do--Because you piss people off 24/7! KATE: I'm glad you do all the...

2577
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:19,100
JERRY: And tell them you're going to kill them. RYAN: That's what I'm supposed to do!

2578
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:20,880
(laughter)

2579
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,199
JERRY: Anyway, that's why.

2580
01:46:22,199 --> 01:46:23,559
Is your...

2581
01:46:23,979 --> 01:46:24,819
AMY: Oh no...

2582
01:46:24,819 --> 01:46:26,439
JERRY: Tell me about this.

2583
01:46:26,439 --> 01:46:28,859
Is your Armor Class 24?

2584
01:46:28,859 --> 01:46:31,159
RYAN: No. 18. KATE: Very close, though.

2585
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:34,319
KRIS: The Armor Class of this house isn't even... AMY: Yeah. Right?

2586
01:46:34,579 --> 01:46:36,159
JERRY: Alright. AMY: Aw jeez.

2587
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:38,059
KATE: Is that your AC with your new goodies? KRIS: Yes.

2588
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,520
KATE: Cool. KRIS: See I outlined it...

2589
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:41,560
JERRY: 5... KRIS: So it's like (deet deet deet)

2590
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,700
KATE: I love it.

2591
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:45,179
JERRY: Hang on. I have a LOT of dice I have to roll.

2592
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:47,980
RYAN: God, are you serious? JERRY: Yeah. I'm totally serious.

2593
01:46:49,239 --> 01:46:50,699
You take 5 points.

2594
01:46:50,699 --> 01:46:51,880
RYAN: Alright.

2595
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:56,739
JERRY: And then...you know the second half of this, all to well.

2596
01:46:56,739 --> 01:46:58,559
- Oh God. Oh...

2597
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,520
- At the moment the sword strikes...

2598
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,820
You don't know if it's the blade cutting the air

2599
01:47:06,819 --> 01:47:10,000
or a whisper from your assailant's mouth,

2600
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,739
but you feel the divine presence...

2601
01:47:13,739 --> 01:47:14,880
AMY: Whoa. RYAN: Oh...

2602
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,460
- of the god he serves.

2603
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:20,359
KRIS: Ah... JERRY: Basically slam you back against the stairs.

2604
01:47:20,359 --> 01:47:22,059
And that's an additional 10.

2605
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:24,240
RYAN: 10?!? AMY: Whoa! He just got smote!

2606
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,159
RYAN: Ugh. Fuck this guy. KRIS: Dang.

2607
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,819
KATE: Time to...Lay on Hands.

2608
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:29,579
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: If you know what I mean.

2609
01:47:29,579 --> 01:47:31,859
JERRY: So you guys see a flash of light.

2610
01:47:31,859 --> 01:47:33,819
There's the cut. AMY: (scree sound)

2611
01:47:33,819 --> 01:47:37,319
JERRY: There's the cut and then just this pillar of light

2612
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:40,579
emanates and just smashes Donaar into the stair.

2613
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:42,640
KATE: Whoof! KRIS: But has the party noticed?

2614
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,400
KRIS: The party-goers...are they...? RYAN: Yeah.

2615
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:46,099
KRIS: Do they hear that? Or...? RYAN: We'll see how it goes.

2616
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:47,740
KATE: Oh boy. JERRY: Donaar.

2617
01:47:47,739 --> 01:47:49,599
RYAN: Uh... (blows raspberry)

2618
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,039
KATE: Is he prone?

2619
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:54,899
RYAN: So...yeah. So I--maybe I misunderstand this layout of this room.

2620
01:47:54,899 --> 01:47:57,159
So I thought we went upstairs into the room.

2621
01:47:57,159 --> 01:47:58,599
We take stairs down into the room?

2622
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,820
KATE: We are... JERRY: No, no. You take stairs. Right now...

2623
01:48:00,819 --> 01:48:02,819
JERRY: you are halfway up the stairs.

2624
01:48:02,819 --> 01:48:03,979
RYAN: Up the stairs. OK. JERRY &amp; KATE: Yeah.

2625
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:06,759
KATE: The room's behind us. RYAN: Yeah. OK. So we were walking down the stairs

2626
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,000
KATE: Right.   KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: towards them. OK.

2627
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,439
RYAN: Alright. So, I'm not prone?

2628
01:48:10,439 --> 01:48:12,699
JERRY: It would be very easy to get back up. RYAN: Alright.

2629
01:48:12,699 --> 01:48:14,439
JERRY: It's just a heavy shock.

2630
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:17,720
RYAN: Uh...OK.

2631
01:48:20,739 --> 01:48:22,519
13's pretty low. (laughs)

2632
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,140
And I'm the only one who could heal.

2633
01:48:24,619 --> 01:48:26,380
KATE: Oh, you have 13 hit points left?

2634
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:28,340
RYAN: Yes.   KATE: Got it. KRIS: No, no, no. You gotta take that.

2635
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:30,000
KRIS: I'm glad you don't have the egg with you.

2636
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,140
RYAN: Yeah... JERRY: Yeah!

2637
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:33,640
RYAN: Well I'm saying, do I heal or do I strike back?

2638
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,600
JERRY: These are the choices... RYAN: Yeah.

2639
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,500
JERRY: that excite me as a Dungeon Master!

2640
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,560
KATE: Do you dungeon? Or do you dragon?

2641
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,780
JERRY: Those are the two choices. JERRY: Oh...I fucking dragon.

2642
01:48:41,779 --> 01:48:43,759
RYAN: So I look at the dude who swung at me,

2643
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,140
and I use Command.

2644
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,900
And I say, "Betray."

2645
01:48:46,899 --> 01:48:49,839
KATE: Nice! This is what I'm talking about! KRIS: Oh!

2646
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:51,320
KATE: (exhales)

2647
01:48:52,699 --> 01:48:54,720
RYAN: So he must make a Wisdom saving throw

2648
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,800
or follow the Command...on his next turn.

2649
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:57,940
KATE: What's your Spell DC?

2650
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,640
JERRY: (sings) ♫ Spell DC! ♫

2651
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,180
♫ Whoa! ♫

2652
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:04,119
KRIS: God, can I give him Guidance on that, or I can't do that can I?

2653
01:49:04,119 --> 01:49:06,699
JERRY: ♫ Oh! Spell DC! ♫ KATE: What is Guidance?

2654
01:49:06,699 --> 01:49:08,559
KATE: That just like makes it super good? KRIS: That's the one I should have...yeah.

2655
01:49:08,939 --> 01:49:11,079
KRIS: Yeah, it'd just let him add a d4 to the roll.

2656
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:13,119
KATE: Oh nice. To a melee check? OK.

2657
01:49:13,399 --> 01:49:19,859
JERRY: He...you think that it might have...penetrated...

2658
01:49:19,859 --> 01:49:21,039
RYAN: OK.

2659
01:49:21,039 --> 01:49:23,100
JERRY: the scalp. Like Selsun's Blue.

2660
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,640
AMY: Not... KRIS: (blows air)

2661
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,180
AMY &amp; KATE: Hmm.   RYAN: OK. AMY: Been there.

2662
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,619
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: This has got less sexy as it were.

2663
01:49:27,619 --> 01:49:28,760
JERRY: (laughs) RYAN: Yeah.

2664
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:31,220
AMY: Selsun Blue can be sexy. JERRY: We're aging it up. Aging it up.

2665
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:32,260
KRIS: Oh. Flake free?

2666
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:33,699
KRIS: Are you kidding me? JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b.

2667
01:49:33,699 --> 01:49:37,199
JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b. You are right now at the top of the stairs.

2668
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:39,859
KRIS: OK. KERRY: And then behind you, you can hear...

2669
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:44,560
the door...the handle to the door opening.

2670
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,840
KRIS: Oh wait. Is--who's--is this the...uh... KATE: Veranda door?

2671
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:50,940
JERRY: Yes exactly. So you are at the top,

2672
01:49:50,939 --> 01:49:54,059
and you can hear someone trying to come out from the party.

2673
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:57,500
KRIS: Oh I see, I see. Right. KATE: Oh! From within the party room. OK.

2674
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:59,199
KRIS: To enter the Alarm zone.

2675
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:00,600
JERRY: No, no.

2676
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:04,800
Cuz right now you had come out to observe the rest of this...

2677
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,280
conflict right? KATE: You're at the top of the stairs.

2678
01:50:06,279 --> 01:50:07,519
RYAN: Yeah, you're all watching me get beat up.

2679
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,760
JERRY: You're at the top of the stairs... KRIS: Right.

2680
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,220
JERRY: And there are people from the party

2681
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:12,699
who you think are trying to leave the party and look... KATE: You closed the door behind you.

2682
01:50:12,699 --> 01:50:14,599
JERRY: And see what's happening out here. KRIS: Oh I see.

2683
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:17,200
KATE: So we're making a rucket. A ruckus. JERRY: This is the situation.

2684
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:18,239
KRIS: Hmmm...

2685
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:22,659
JERRY: Not connected with parents...or vacations...at all.

2686
01:50:22,659 --> 01:50:23,960
KRIS: I was gonna say, yeah... JERRY: (laughs)

2687
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,159
KRIS: So my choices are...

2688
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,059
Help my friend...

2689
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:33,320
Or tastefully let the person know

2690
01:50:33,319 --> 01:50:35,840
that this exit is not available...

2691
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,319
RYAN: Yeah. (laughs) KRIS: at this time...

2692
01:50:37,319 --> 01:50:39,340
KATE: Can you Awakened Mind them? RYAN: Both valid choices.

2693
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:41,360
RYAN: One...lot more valid than the other.

2694
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:42,699
KATE: Just like let them, they're like,

2695
01:50:42,699 --> 01:50:45,500
"You know what? This party's nice. I'm gonna stay here."

2696
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,159
KRIS: I'm gonna...

2697
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,820
JERRY: Dissonant Whispers.

2698
01:50:48,819 --> 01:50:49,939
KRIS: It didn't...(laughs) RYAN: Then me.

2699
01:50:49,939 --> 01:50:51,479
KRIS: It would kill that party goer.

2700
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:53,500
JERRY: (laughs) KRIS: He can't warn anybody if he's dead.

2701
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:56,159
KRIS: I will...

2702
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,739
I'm gonna not pay attention to that.

2703
01:50:58,739 --> 01:51:01,340
Because I think it's better if

2704
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:03,680
they are alive than if they're...

2705
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:05,699
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: relaxed.

2706
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:06,559
KATE: That's right. OK. JERRY: Yeah.

2707
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,100
KRIS: So let me go ahead and...

2708
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:09,980
JERRY: Get clever.

2709
01:51:09,979 --> 01:51:11,319
KRIS: Yum, yum, yum.

2710
01:51:11,319 --> 01:51:13,039
(whispers) What's the best use?

2711
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:14,920
RYAN: (whispers) Mend! KRIS: What kind of flavor!

2712
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,680
JERRY: (laughs) KRIS: What? That's not going to do anything.

2713
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18,000
RYAN: I'm getting beat up.

2714
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,619
KRIS: Oh, I had a question. JERRY: Yeah.

2715
01:51:19,619 --> 01:51:22,800
KRIS: So in the intervening--you can tell me no if this is the case but like,

2716
01:51:22,899 --> 01:51:25,259
the cloak that I was given

2717
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:28,860
JERRY: Yes. Indeed. KRIS: or that I retrieved from the goblin's cart...

2718
01:51:28,859 --> 01:51:32,000
KRIS: In that time in between, had I taken time

2719
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,899
to understand what the nature of these stars were?

2720
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,980
JERRY: You can. KRIS: Because I outside of...

2721
01:51:38,979 --> 01:51:41,419
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well yeah. KRIS: character think I know what it is.

2722
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:44,579
JERRY: Think about how much time you've had rolling around in this cart.

2723
01:51:44,579 --> 01:51:46,059
KRIS: Yeah I wanted to know.

2724
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,360
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. KRIS: Cuz the thing is...

2725
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:49,359
RYAN: It's funny if you just like note: you waited til now...

2726
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:51,579
mid-combat, you're like History check?

2727
01:51:51,579 --> 01:51:53,859
KRIS: Aw dangit. JERRY: Yea exactly. No, hang on.

2728
01:51:53,859 --> 01:51:55,819
RYAN: Let me do an Arcane check on this.

2729
01:51:55,819 --> 01:51:56,920
KRIS: That's how I use my turn.

2730
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:59,539
JERRY: Exactly. KRIS: It's two full actions...

2731
01:51:59,539 --> 01:52:01,840
KRIS: I use one action on opening the book.

2732
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,460
The next action would be finding the right page.

2733
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:05,380
KATE: But here's the question. What would K'thriss do?

2734
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,579
WWKD?

2735
01:52:06,579 --> 01:52:08,239
KRIS: Oh he'd 100% would have been trying to figure out --

2736
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:09,800
KATE: No, I mean right now in this moment.

2737
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,779
KRIS: Oh right now... KATE: Would he like get distracted, would he like,

2738
01:52:11,779 --> 01:52:13,279
"Oh yeah! This cloak."

2739
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:14,880
KRIS: No...No...!

2740
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,940
JERRY: No, no. But you do know what it does.

2741
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:19,179
KATE: OK. KRIS: Would you inform the viewing audience?

2742
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:21,940
JERRY: Yeah, absolutely. So like I say,

2743
01:52:21,939 --> 01:52:24,019
the cloak is enough like your old cloak

2744
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:25,780
that you don't have to change your character art.

2745
01:52:25,779 --> 01:52:27,800
RYAN &amp; KRIS: (whew)   KATE: Thank God. KRIS: That's all I cared about.

2746
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:35,779
JERRY: But suspended in its deep blue texture is...pinprick stars,

2747
01:52:35,779 --> 01:52:36,920
KRIS: Right.

2748
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:42,060
JERRY: that to a casual observer would simply be shine.

2749
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:44,100
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: But there's a depth,

2750
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:46,079
JERRY: a strange depth, to them.

2751
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:51,819
And these crystals, who feel familiar to you,

2752
01:52:51,819 --> 01:52:55,739
can be plucked from that night sky

2753
01:52:55,739 --> 01:52:58,300
and hurled as missiles.

2754
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,100
- Right. And that would count --

2755
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:04,240
what I read was that is Magic Missile at 5th level.

2756
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:06,159
Is that not the case for this garment? JERRY: Not for you.

2757
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:07,699
- Is it just at my level?

2758
01:53:07,699 --> 01:53:10,460
JERRY: Not for you. It is... AMY: 6th level.   RYAN: Yeah.

2759
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,500
RYAN: 10th level. JERRY: 20th level.

2760
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:13,699
KRIS: Yeah, when you're a god! KATE: Remember when you were level 9?

2761
01:53:13,699 --> 01:53:16,819
RYAN: Yeah.   AMY: No. RYAN: You cast Wish every time.

2762
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,480
JERRY: This right here is a...

2763
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:23,060
There' a lot that's gonna happen with it... KRIS: Sure.

2764
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:29,300
JERRY: What it does at this point, is 3d4 damage.

2765
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:33,060
KATE: Holy fucking hell... KRIS: That's what I wanted to discern.

2766
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:34,740
JERRY: Yeah. KRIS: So I didn't--Yeah OK.

2767
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:37,659
JERRY: You tested it out on bottles. KRIS: Yeah.

2768
01:53:37,659 --> 01:53:39,539
KRIS: That feels like a 3d4, I think.

2769
01:53:39,539 --> 01:53:41,239
KRIS: Yeah...Alright. RYAN: (laughs)

2770
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,020
KRIS: OK. And I got how many of those a day do I have? How many are around there?

2771
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:47,020
JERRY: There's six around there. KRIS: There's six of them, OK.

2772
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:49,880
KRIS: Let me...throw those.

2773
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:54,480
First of all I'm gonna Hex this guy who just lashed out at him.

2774
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:58,240
So he's gonna have a big frown on his face.

2775
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:01,640
And then I'm gonna throw one of my stars at him.

2776
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:03,060
RYAN: Well...

2777
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:06,120
AMY: Wait, not the guy that he... RYAN: The guy--I got Command on him right now.

2778
01:54:06,119 --> 01:54:08,220
KRIS: I'm sorry. I forgot about that. RYAN: So he's gonna swing on his buddies.

2779
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:09,560
KRIS: That's an excellent point. RYAN: Yeah.

2780
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:12,520
KRIS: I'm not going to hurt him.   RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: He's our friend. I'm going to --

2781
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:15,520
RYAN: For one turn. KRIS: Let me select one of his compatriots.

2782
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,420
JERRY: Mmhmm. KRIS: And do what I just said. (laughs)

2783
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:20,239
JERRY: Yeah...all different stuff?

2784
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:21,479
KRIS: Hmm? KATE: Same with the Hex?

2785
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:22,719
KATE: Do you wanna read what Hex does?

2786
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,780
KRIS: Sure. It's just gonna make him sad?

2787
01:54:24,779 --> 01:54:26,219
JERRY: (laughs) RYAN: Oh, OK.

2788
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,940
JERRY: They're gonna catch a sad? KATE: Bummed out.

2789
01:54:27,939 --> 01:54:29,939
KRIS: Yeah. He's gonna have teh sadz.

2790
01:54:29,939 --> 01:54:31,279
JERRY: (laughs) AMY: God...

2791
01:54:31,279 --> 01:54:32,699
KRIS: Which I can't stand. KATE: Why did you say that?

2792
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:34,800
KRIS: Sorry. It's rancid. AMY: Rawr.

2793
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,960
KRIS: So I'm gonna be able to deal an extra 1d6 necrotic on that one.

2794
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,460
And I can choose Disadvantage on an ability check of theirs.

2795
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:47,680
So I'm gonna...So let me sour their Strength.

2796
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,880
JERRY: OK.   KRIS: OK. RYAN: Target the one with the bolt.

2797
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:50,980
RYAN: I think it was the one on the left.

2798
01:54:50,979 --> 01:54:53,319
JERRY: Mmhmm.   KATE: Yeah, I think so too. KRIS: That's fine with me.   AMY: Bolt boy.

2799
01:54:53,319 --> 01:54:54,099
JERRY: Yeah.

2800
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:56,360
KRIS: And now...to throw...

2801
01:54:56,380 --> 01:54:58,460
this little star. (die clatters)

2802
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:00,279
Oh...but it's Magic Missile. JERRY: Mmhmm.

2803
01:55:00,279 --> 01:55:01,599
KRIS: Does that have... JERRY: Yeah you don't roll to strike.

2804
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,500
KRIS: Yeah, OK. JERRY: You just get a handful of d4's and...

2805
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:04,920
AMY: It's auto-hit. JERRY: get sick with it.

2806
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:07,380
KRIS: Yum, yum, yum. You're gonna love it. AMY: You ain't even gotta AIM on that bad boy.

2807
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:08,480
KRIS: Oh I got them. No worries. KATE: You got them?

2808
01:55:08,479 --> 01:55:11,459
KRIS: And then I'm gonna add that d6 that I've applied with Hex.

2809
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:12,980
KRIS: (dice clatters) Let's see what we got. KATE: Holy shit!

2810
01:55:12,979 --> 01:55:14,099
RYAN: Hmm. KRIS: We got...

2811
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:15,820
KRIS: Whoops, sorry. This was a 2.

2812
01:55:15,819 --> 01:55:18,000
Uhh 8. That's 9

2813
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:20,319
(pweh) of damage

2814
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:22,739
AMY: (clears throat) KRIS: to this robed fellow.

2815
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:24,119
JERRY: Absolutely...

2816
01:55:24,119 --> 01:55:26,279
You reach up to the clasp

2817
01:55:26,979 --> 01:55:29,079
and then fling it out

2818
01:55:29,079 --> 01:55:32,479
and then almost, as if in slow motion,

2819
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:35,279
you see it burst almost like a seed...

2820
01:55:35,899 --> 01:55:41,259
in midair and trace arcs around your companions.

2821
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,560
KRIS: Ooo.

2822
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:45,420
JERRY: They don't become discrete missiles.

2823
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:50,380
It's almost like a solid arc of force. KRIS: Hmm.

2824
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:54,579
JERRY: That starts here and then traces paths around your allies,

2825
01:55:54,579 --> 01:56:00,559
keeping them safe, and then all of it projects itself into the foe.

2826
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,060
AMY: That's awesome. JERRY: So how much damage?

2827
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:04,780
KATE: 9... KRIS: It was 9, yeah..

2828
01:56:04,779 --> 01:56:07,000
JERRY: K. RYAN: All from your K'thlasp.

2829
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,060
KATE: He K'threw it.

2830
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:10,880
RYAN: He K'threw it. I like that too.

2831
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,940
KRIS: That was better.   Kate: Thanks. JERRY: Alright, I love it.   RYAN: No.

2832
01:56:12,939 --> 01:56:15,099
(laughter)

2833
01:56:15,899 --> 01:56:19,960
JERRY: Alright. You see him whisper something.

2834
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:27,180
As it connects, he's able to maintain his grip on the edge,

2835
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:30,300
and not get thrown all the way down the stairs. KRIS: Oh I see, I see.

2836
01:56:32,039 --> 01:56:34,060
JERRY: Walnut.   KRIS: Would have been nice. RYAN: To Newt Spiderton.

2837
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:35,280
JERRY: Walnut Dankgrass...

2838
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:36,500
Yeah, exactly! AMY: Hungry!

2839
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:38,520
JERRY: There's new locations opening up all the time.

2840
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,000
AMY: I'm hungry.

2841
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:43,260
JERRY: Out front there is a... AMY: Well...

2842
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:46,900
JERRY: There is a--you can see a large stone off the path.

2843
01:56:46,899 --> 01:56:51,059
I mean you can see--your vision encompasses a gigantic dome.

2844
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,440
AMY: Mmhmm.

2845
01:56:52,439 --> 01:56:57,279
JERRY: What's happening in here is just one part of your awareness, right?

2846
01:56:57,279 --> 01:56:58,739
AMY: What else do I perceive?

2847
01:56:58,739 --> 01:57:03,880
JERRY: On a...there's sort of a decorative, tasteful boulder

2848
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:06,699
up near the end of the path that comes from the Long Road.

2849
01:57:06,699 --> 01:57:08,300
AMY: Well I like that boulder... JERRY: And you can see...

2850
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:11,400
AMY: It's a nice boulder. JERRY: You can see a werewolf

2851
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:15,100
JERRY: sitting cross-legged on it.

2852
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:18,500
Looking down the path and he seems sad.

2853
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:20,619
(laughter)

2854
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:24,880
AMY: That would require me to get out of spider-form. Ryan: Yeah.

2855
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,119
KRIS: No...   RYAN: We got more pressing matters... JERRY: Yeah.   AMY: OK.

2856
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,260
JERRY: He seems...(stammers) I'm just sayin' -- RYAN: than cheering up a werewolf (laughs).

2857
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:31,340
JERRY: I'm sayin' he seems bummed out. KRIS: He's so sad, though.

2858
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:33,640
KATE: There's a sad werewolf. What do you do? RYAN: (sighs) But he's like, REALLY sad, though.

2859
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,500
RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Let me ask you this.

2860
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:36,960
JERRY: Yeah.   KATE: (laughs) RYAN: Super sad.

2861
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,460
AMY: Could I just wave to him as a bonus action?

2862
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,340
Just one little spider -- JERRY: Just one little pedipalp?

2863
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:41,480
AMY: Yeah, just like a little...

2864
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:43,520
AMY: (bweep) JERRY: Yeah.

2865
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,960
AMY: And then I wanna turn...

2866
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,520
JERRY: You give him the wave and he's just like...

2867
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:48,539
(laughter)

2868
01:57:48,539 --> 01:57:51,680
AMY: That's fine. This is good. KRIS: Poor Trevor.

2869
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,640
AMY: But so... RYAN: Fucking Trevor.

2870
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:54,840
KATE: Oh Trevor.

2871
01:57:55,039 --> 01:57:57,600
- I can see the stairs

2872
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:00,440
that these guys are having this altercation on, right?

2873
01:58:00,439 --> 01:58:02,399
- From one of the windows in the front there, yeah.

2874
01:58:02,399 --> 01:58:05,879
I mean basically your, like I say, your awareness extends in these windows;

2875
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:09,779
you can see the entire affair, and out here.

2876
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:10,940
- OK.

2877
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:13,859
I want to...

2878
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:15,159
I wanna --

2879
01:58:15,159 --> 01:58:17,139
- Live as a spider. I want to BE a spider.

2880
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:19,760
- Yeah so basically it's just like...

2881
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,440
it's just me living out my fantasy.

2882
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:23,919
I want to know if I can...

2883
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,960
shoot a Web through...

2884
01:58:27,739 --> 01:58:29,039
- The glass?

2885
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:31,519
- I mean could I--I guess I don't want to bust the glass...

2886
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:34,280
And I can't like spider-open it and be like ('peh' spitting sound)

2887
01:58:34,279 --> 01:58:35,719
KATE: (laughs)   KRIS: Maybe. AMY: A little spitball.

2888
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:37,860
KATE: You never know.   KRIS: Is it opened? KATE: It's Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

2889
01:58:37,859 --> 01:58:40,380
AMY: Can I try? I can do a lot of cool stuff. JERRY: Do you wanna try?

2890
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:43,640
JERRY: (stammers) Think about their sticky little feet. RYAN: Break the glass. Who cares?

2891
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:46,340
KRIS: Yeah you may be able to like, take the pane out... KATE: You got sticky feet. Yeah, oh yeah.

2892
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:48,239
KRIS: with that sticky foot. AMY: That's true.

2893
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:51,340
AMY: I can do a lot of cool things. JERRY: And just shove your spinnerets in there.

2894
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:53,680
KRIS: Yeah. Just fit it in, and then (spit sound)

2895
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:55,640
KRIS: Yeah. That's cool. KATE: Maybe you bite the window.

2896
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,960
JERRY: Get stuck (laughs)

2897
01:58:57,239 --> 01:58:58,639
Like Winnie the Pooh!

2898
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,220
KRIS: And the party's so tasteful beneath

2899
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:02,699
and just this arc of web!

2900
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:06,000
JERRY: (stammers) Yeah, so do you wanna try to make a...

2901
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,159
AMY: Yes.

2902
01:59:07,159 --> 01:59:08,720
JERRY: make a hole there? AMY: Yeah.

2903
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:11,220
JERRY: So you've waved over here; sort of your bonus thing.

2904
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:12,300
AMY: Yeah. Sort of.

2905
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:15,500
JERRY: Manipulating this is probably gonna be your turn, but it's ok.

2906
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:16,939
AMY: Right, OK. KRIS: It'll be worth it.

2907
01:59:16,939 --> 01:59:18,519
JERRY: Absolutely. Let's see...

2908
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:19,960
So you have all your stats and everything here, right?

2909
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:21,579
AMY: Yes. What do you want me to roll?

2910
01:59:21,579 --> 01:59:24,559
JERRY: I would like to see some Dexterity here.

2911
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,840
AMY: Oh. JERRY: But I'll...

2912
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:29,420
account for the fact that you're like a spider...

2913
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:31,300
sticky...feet.

2914
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:33,340
AMY: Don't worry. My Dex is good. JERRY: You know what I mean?

2915
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,660
(die clatters)

2916
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:37,079
AMY: (snaps fingers) Not...

2917
01:59:37,079 --> 01:59:37,939
good...

2918
01:59:37,939 --> 01:59:38,799
enough.

2919
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:39,760
JERRY: OK. AMY: It would have been a 9.

2920
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:40,960
JERRY: Yeah. You...

2921
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:42,760
You reach your...

2922
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:45,460
You reach one of your most clever feet...

2923
01:59:45,859 --> 01:59:47,199
down to the pane.

2924
01:59:47,859 --> 01:59:50,699
AMY: Mmm. JERRY: You can feel it stick.

2925
01:59:50,699 --> 01:59:53,679
AMY: Mmhmm. JERRY: And then it goes, all the way through.

2926
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:57,039
JERRY: And pieces of glass fall inside. KRIS: Oh.

2927
01:59:57,039 --> 01:59:58,140
AMY: Oops.

2928
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:01,060
JERRY: And you can see that some a little bit of glass

2929
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:03,740
has fallen on one of the servants.

2930
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:06,460
And they go... AMY: Oops.   KRIS: Oh no.

2931
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:07,840
JERRY: (exhausted) "Uh."

2932
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,619
KRIS: (laughs) AMY: And I go (squelching sounds)

2933
02:00:09,619 --> 02:00:11,340
AMY: Which means, "Seize the means of production."

2934
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,940
JERRY: Yeah, exactly!   KATE: (laughs) AMY: They know what it means.

2935
02:00:13,939 --> 02:00:15,699
JERRY: There's another life for you! KRIS: Yeah.

2936
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,720
AMY: OK. Well I guess that's my turn.

2937
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:20,000
JERRY: It is. Rosie.

2938
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,180
KATE: OK. JERRY: So they have...

2939
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:24,680
JERRY: They have brought the fight.

2940
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:27,240
KATE: OK. And we have...

2941
02:00:27,239 --> 02:00:29,579
one of the mean boys is betraying,

2942
02:00:29,579 --> 02:00:32,600
potentially, his comrades.

2943
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:34,380
We're crossing our fingers on that. RYAN: Yeah.

2944
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:36,180
KATE: And you've attacked bolt guy.

2945
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:37,940
Tell me about the third...

2946
02:00:38,359 --> 02:00:39,899
JERRY: In the middle? KATE: hunter?

2947
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:41,739
KATE: I suppose so, yeah. JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

2948
02:00:41,739 --> 02:00:44,779
JERRY: So you just wanna know...how they're armed? KATE: Yeah, I just want a description.

2949
02:00:44,779 --> 02:00:48,679
KATE: I'm taking some notes. JERRY: Absolutely. This figure...

2950
02:00:49,079 --> 02:00:51,340
JERRY: Much about them is indeterminate.

2951
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:53,619
They're all in sort of their uniform.

2952
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,619
But you can see that they have --

2953
02:00:57,619 --> 02:01:01,079
that their hands are reaching in on both sides underneath the cloak.

2954
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:06,619
And when they act, it would almost certainly be with two weapons.

2955
02:01:06,619 --> 02:01:08,279
KRIS: It's gonna be the Macarena.

2956
02:01:08,279 --> 02:01:10,880
(laughter) KATE: OK.

2957
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:13,039
JERRY: I don't think it is. KRIS: Alright.

2958
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:15,600
JERRY: (old aristocrat voice) That won't be invented for a thousand years!

2959
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:19,699
KRIS: Monocle pops off. What the...! JERRY: (harrumphs)

2960
02:01:19,699 --> 02:01:21,739
(laughter) KRIS: Scandalous!

2961
02:01:21,739 --> 02:01:23,439
(laughter) JERRY: Macarena!

2962
02:01:23,439 --> 02:01:25,299
(laughter)

2963
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:32,920
KATE: OK. I have a quality as a Halfling called Nimbleness.

2964
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:36,880
Which allows me to move through the space of any larger creature.

2965
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:41,640
Can I use that ability to get behind them without...

2966
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:43,640
JERRY: Yeah. KATE: them even noticing.

2967
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:45,780
KATE: OK. JERRY: Well I don't know about noticing.

2968
02:01:45,779 --> 02:01:47,979
KATE: But without them stopping me. JERRY: But with ease.

2969
02:01:47,979 --> 02:01:49,099
- OK. OK.

2970
02:01:49,579 --> 02:01:54,079
Then I'm going to--I would like to dart behind the dagger friend,

2971
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:55,100
- Mmhmm.

2972
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:58,800
- and spin around and attack him from behind.

2973
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,760
Hopefully before he has a chance to react.

2974
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:02,220
Maybe... JERRY: It's your turn, yeah.

2975
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:07,199
- Maybe even get an Advantage on that for attacking from behind.

2976
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:09,939
Could that possibly be something that I do?

2977
02:02:09,939 --> 02:02:12,159
- Here, if you give me a little bit of Acrobatics.

2978
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:13,599
KATE: Oh God.   RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Sure.

2979
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:15,460
- What that will communicate to me is

2980
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:16,720
that you done this perfectly.

2981
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,579
- OK so you want me to do an Acrobatics roll?

2982
02:02:18,579 --> 02:02:19,880
JERRY: I do. KATE: OK (die clatters)

2983
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,460
- It's a 23.

2984
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:22,960
- Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2985
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,720
(stammers) Basically just right between them.

2986
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:25,740
- OK.

2987
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:29,519
- (stammers) It's like one of the Japanese game shows.

2988
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:30,900
- Yeah. You make the shapes.

2989
02:02:30,899 --> 02:02:33,079
- You make exactly the shape needed

2990
02:02:33,079 --> 02:02:35,559
to pirouette around, and then that --

2991
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:37,920
the strike is actually part of that motion.

2992
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:38,600
- OK.

2993
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:39,800
JERRY: So let's hear it. KATE: OK.

2994
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:42,199
- And you gonna give me Advantage on that?

2995
02:02:42,199 --> 02:02:43,239
JERRY: Oh yeah. KATE: Oh hell yeah!

2996
02:02:43,239 --> 02:02:46,000
JERRY: Yeah, I think it's super cool. KATE: I learned this from Pat Rothfuss, by the way.

2997
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,920
JERRY: This is what I want. It's not 100%.

2998
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:49,319
KATE: Oh my God. That's a 19.

2999
02:02:49,319 --> 02:02:50,859
KRIS: These are hot rolls! KATE: Let's just see what happens.

3000
02:02:50,859 --> 02:02:52,519
KATE: Oh another 19. Oops.

3001
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,840
OK. So that's a 24 with the quarterstaff.

3002
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,079
JERRY: Mmhmm. KRIS: It's fated.

3003
02:02:56,079 --> 02:03:00,100
KATE: And that's gonna be 6 points of damage.

3004
02:03:00,100 --> 02:03:02,260
I will also take a...

3005
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:05,860
an unarmed strike which is another 4 points of damage.

3006
02:03:05,859 --> 02:03:08,079
And spend a ki point... JERRY: (snorts)

3007
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:10,960
KATE: and just get him right up their little butts,

3008
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,119
(die clatters) KRIS: Ooo yeah.   RYAN: Nice.

3009
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:13,699
KATE: for another 7 points of damage. RYAN: Nice.

3010
02:03:13,699 --> 02:03:15,439
KRIS: That was the worst one yet. KATE: Yeah.

3011
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:16,979
JERRY: Good Lord!

3012
02:03:16,979 --> 02:03:19,859
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: Yeah, it's just--it is a flurry of attacks.

3013
02:03:19,859 --> 02:03:21,859
KATE: Right in the ankles. JERRY: Well no, no. It's a flurry of attacks,

3014
02:03:21,859 --> 02:03:25,359
and every one of them is striking some nerve cluster.

3015
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:28,059
KATE: Yeah. JERRY: You see them just bend like a...

3016
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:30,480
like those poseable... those wooden poseable...

3017
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:31,619
KRIS: Yeah. They just go ('meah" sound)

3018
02:03:31,619 --> 02:03:34,260
JERRY: Yeah. The figure goes in, and they go the (collapse sound)

3019
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:37,039
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: (stammers) Just...hunched.

3020
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:38,720
Creaked over.

3021
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:40,340
A parody of life!

3022
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:42,760
KATE: Perfect. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

3023
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:44,659
JERRY: Just barely hanging on.

3024
02:03:44,659 --> 02:03:45,760
KATE: This is my design. JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

3025
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:47,640
JERRY: Just barely hanging on here.

3026
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:51,560
JERRY: Now it is their turn.

3027
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:54,500
So he turns...

3028
02:03:54,979 --> 02:03:58,759
He wheels himself toward you on the stairs,

3029
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:01,360
tries to solve some of his serious

3030
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:04,819
chiropractic issues that you developed.

3031
02:04:05,699 --> 02:04:06,720
(die clatters)

3032
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:08,260
Oh shit!

3033
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:12,800
When the...

3034
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:17,020
the paladin who had initiated this fight to begin with,

3035
02:04:18,079 --> 02:04:21,260
brings this rapier...

3036
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:24,779
straight through the midsection...

3037
02:04:24,779 --> 02:04:26,259
AMY: Hmm. KATE: Hmm.

3038
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:29,000
JERRY: of this--of your opponent.

3039
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,380
KATE: Uh huh. KRIS: Oh...!

3040
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:32,220
RYAN: He's a bad friend. (laughter)

3041
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:34,619
KATE: This is the betray boy.    RYAN: Yeah. Yup. KATE: Got it, got it. OK.

3042
02:04:35,659 --> 02:04:38,500
JERRY: And then after that happens,

3043
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:41,979
basically the top half of this entity,

3044
02:04:41,979 --> 02:04:44,579
deeply surprised by this chain of events,

3045
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:47,840
falls ON you.

3046
02:04:48,319 --> 02:04:49,199
KATE: Ooo.

3047
02:04:50,039 --> 02:04:54,600
JERRY: And the paladin cries out to his fellow,

3048
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:56,760
says, "Run! Run, brother!"

3049
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:59,020
RYAN: Hmm!   KRIS: Oh... AMY: Nice.

3050
02:04:59,020 --> 02:05:00,740
JERRY: But his brother does not run. (die clatters)

3051
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:05,060
His brother, instead, tries to kill Rosie Beestringer.

3052
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:06,780
KATE: What?   JERRY: It's true. AMY: He's a bad boy.

3053
02:05:06,779 --> 02:05:08,439
JERRY: What is your...

3054
02:05:08,439 --> 02:05:10,159
Is your Armor Class...

3055
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:12,180
RYAN: Hey, he killed his buddy. Not us. JERRY: Yeah.

3056
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:14,140
KRIS: No, no, no. He's gotta live with that.

3057
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:15,180
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: 17?

3058
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:17,720
KATE: No.   KRIS: He might not. RYAN: He's probably not going to...   JERRY: K.

3059
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,039
(die clatters) JERRY: Oh! D8...

3060
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:22,159
(die clatters)

3061
02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:23,840
7 points. KATE: K.

3062
02:05:29,859 --> 02:05:34,159
JERRY: And then as a bonus action,

3063
02:05:34,619 --> 02:05:38,059
he reaches into one of the many pockets

3064
02:05:38,539 --> 02:05:42,960
of this leather jacket, grabs a red vial

3065
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,939
and crushes it in his hand.

3066
02:05:44,939 --> 02:05:47,099
RYAN: Hmm. KATE: Hmm.

3067
02:05:48,619 --> 02:05:49,920
RYAN: Cyanide pill? KRIS: Got a Dr Pepper or something?

3068
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:50,920
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: Yeah.

3069
02:05:51,539 --> 02:05:52,979
KATE: Mmhmm. JERRY: Exactly.

3070
02:05:52,979 --> 02:05:55,799
JERRY: It is at this point, K'thrss,

3071
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:00,940
that the door opens at the top of the stair.

3072
02:06:00,939 --> 02:06:03,199
Right now there is a total of one person...

3073
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:07,599
KRIS: Mmhmm. JERRY: looking out and assessing this...

3074
02:06:08,579 --> 02:06:11,840
this destruction derby...

3075
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:15,239
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: you have enacted in the lobby.

3076
02:06:15,239 --> 02:06:16,800
JERRY: Donaar Blit'zen.

3077
02:06:17,239 --> 02:06:18,519
RYAN: So one's dead...

3078
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:20,060
JERRY: One's dead. RYAN: I made the one betray the other one.

3079
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:21,440
JERRY: Indeed. RYAN: What about the one you targeted?

3080
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:23,239
RYAN: He's...? KATE: He's hurtin'.

3081
02:06:23,239 --> 02:06:24,159
RYAN: He's hurtin' but he's not...

3082
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:25,439
JERRY: He's hurtin', KRIS: He's hurt but he's...

3083
02:06:25,439 --> 02:06:26,719
RYAN: OK. JERRY: but he's in the fight.

3084
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:27,640
RYAN: OK.

3085
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:31,980
KRIS: He's the one who struck Rosie.

3086
02:06:31,979 --> 02:06:32,899
KATE: Mmhmm. KRIS: Just now.

3087
02:06:32,899 --> 02:06:34,659
RYAN: Oh the hurt one is the one that struck Rosie?

3088
02:06:34,659 --> 02:06:36,819
KATE: No, no, no. That was-- was that Daggers or Bolts?

3089
02:06:36,819 --> 02:06:39,679
JERRY: Yeah Daggers is...is in two pieces. RYAN: Daggers' dead.   KATE: Daggers' dead.

3090
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:42,180
KRIS: He just got cut in half. KATE: Right. Sword is the one who just hit me.

3091
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:43,860
RYAN: Yeah. He's the one who hit me. KRIS: Oh OK, OK.

3092
02:06:43,859 --> 02:06:45,659
KATE: Yeah. Bolt's the one you hit. RYAN: That's right. OK so the...

3093
02:06:45,659 --> 02:06:46,659
KRIS: I see.

3094
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:49,500
JERRY: So two opponents.

3095
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:51,180
RYAN: OK. JERRY: The paladin you commanded.

3096
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:52,260
RYAN: Yup. JERRY: And then the other one.

3097
02:06:53,859 --> 02:06:55,500
RYAN: Should I go for the easy clean up?

3098
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:57,060
Or should I go after the big baddie?

3099
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:59,620
KRIS: Oh no, why do we just -- KATE: What would Driebus do?

3100
02:06:59,619 --> 02:07:01,019
KATE: Sorry. RYAN: What would Driebus do?

3101
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:03,220
AMY: Thinking about your son? KATE: Sorry, I'm thinking about my son right now.

3102
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:04,760
JERRY: You're thinking about your boy? It's like now...

3103
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:06,300
RYAN: I don't know. Yeah. What would Waelvur do?

3104
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:09,260
KRIS: Probably he'd just ruin the entire building. RYAN: Yeah, he would do a...

3105
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:10,579
(laughter) AMY: Should have brought Driebus.

3106
02:07:10,579 --> 02:07:12,059
RYAN: He would Shatter every window.

3107
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:13,920
KATE: Yeah, we should have brought Driebus. RYAN: I know he would have loved these vampires.

3108
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:15,720
RYAN: Faux-goth. AMY: He would have LOVED this!

3109
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:18,079
JERRY: There's so much glass here. He would have a great time.

3110
02:07:18,079 --> 02:07:19,140
AMY: Amazing.

3111
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:21,900
KRIS: Wait. What was I gonna say? Shoot. Agh. No, keep going, keep going.

3112
02:07:21,899 --> 02:07:23,279
RYAN: Yeah.   KRIS: Forgot already. AMY: Do what Donaar would do.

3113
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:25,260
RYAN: Donaar would think about Donaar,

3114
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,440
and heal himself.

3115
02:07:26,439 --> 02:07:27,819
AMY: That's fine. KATE: Alright, Donaar.

3116
02:07:27,819 --> 02:07:29,380
JERRY: Do your thing. RYAN: So I'm gonna Lay on Hands.

3117
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:31,000
KRIS: Oh yeah, I was gonna say wreck the guy who...

3118
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,359
I mean go ahead and do that but

3119
02:07:32,359 --> 02:07:34,579
wreck the guy who's not our friend right now.

3120
02:07:34,579 --> 02:07:38,359
KATE: But the guy who was betraying attacked me.

3121
02:07:38,359 --> 02:07:39,559
KRIS: Right. RYAN: Yeah.

3122
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:41,240
KATE: So he's not anybody's friend.

3123
02:07:41,239 --> 02:07:44,539
KRIS: Oh he's not your friend, but he may yet attack his pal.

3124
02:07:44,539 --> 02:07:45,380
KATE: Oh I see, I see. KRIS: Yeah.

3125
02:07:45,380 --> 02:07:47,960
KATE: The only one he's NOT going to attack is you? Is that how Betray works?

3126
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:50,800
JERRY: (stammers) No, no. Betray. It's one turn. AMY: It's only one turn.   RYAN: Betray is only one turn.

3127
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,539
KATE: Got it. OK.   KRIS: Oh I see. JERRY: One turn. Command.

3128
02:07:52,539 --> 02:07:56,140
KATE: Betray is done. RYAN: So...I can do a 15.

3129
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:57,660
I can bring myself back to normal.

3130
02:07:57,659 --> 02:08:00,260
JERRY: Mmhmm. RYAN: Which I do. I just go, "Mmm...!"

3131
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:02,239
JERRY: Just...Shiatsu? RYAN: "Mmm...!"

3132
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:03,559
RYAN: Just laying there on the stairs,

3133
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:05,380
"Ah...! Oh yeah!"

3134
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:07,579
RYAN: "Ah. Just keep fightin'." JERRY: Right there. This is the spot. You just --

3135
02:08:07,579 --> 02:08:09,819
RYAN: "I needed this. I. Needed. This."

3136
02:08:09,819 --> 02:08:11,099
"Whoo!"

3137
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:13,060
KRIS: Feels better. RYAN &amp; KATE: Treat yo' self!

3138
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:16,520
JERRY: Yeah, right. K'thriss Drow'b. RYAN: "I made a guy murder his friend. I deserve this!"

3139
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:17,480
(laughter)

3140
02:08:17,479 --> 02:08:18,859
(laughter) JERRY: K'thriss Drow'b!

3141
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:22,140
KRIS: How much as a bonus action am I allowed to

3142
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:26,360
turn to this party-goer who's just peering out?

3143
02:08:26,359 --> 02:08:28,119
JERRY: It depends on what you're trying to do.

3144
02:08:28,119 --> 02:08:31,619
KRIS: And just say, "The meals are almost ready."

3145
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:34,420
Like, "We're preparing them stair-side."

3146
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:37,220
(laughter)

3147
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:39,000
Is that permissible?

3148
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:42,040
Before I turn my attention back?

3149
02:08:42,039 --> 02:08:43,500
RYAN: Oh! I got an Entitlement.

3150
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:44,779
JERRY: So you want... AMY: Nice.

3151
02:08:44,779 --> 02:08:45,759
JERRY: You get excited?

3152
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:47,520
KRIS: I just want to send him back in. JERRY: Your bar just fills up.

3153
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:48,640
RYAN: Well now it's like...

3154
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,940
AMY: Now I can do anything.

3155
02:08:49,939 --> 02:08:52,019
JERRY: So basically they're there. KRIS: Mmhmm.

3156
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:55,060
JERRY: They have come out and they're...and you see it, it's like,

3157
02:08:56,539 --> 02:08:57,699
"But..."

3158
02:08:57,939 --> 02:09:00,599
KRIS:  Right. Yeah. And I'm assuming that there's...

3159
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,460
that this one who's been cleaved is just...

3160
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:06,680
splayed blood all over everything.

3161
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:08,900
JERRY: It's like this katamari. It's just like rolling down.

3162
02:09:08,899 --> 02:09:11,259
KATE: Well for some of these party-goers though, that is the meal.

3163
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:12,600
KRIS: That's what I'm saying. KATE: Right. Yeah.

3164
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:14,940
KRIS: That's what I'm saying, "Go ahead and wait back inside."

3165
02:09:14,939 --> 02:09:16,279
"We're going to finish this."

3166
02:09:16,279 --> 02:09:18,139
RYAN: We're gonna kill these guys so you can eat them. KRIS: "Get it all ready and nice for you."

3167
02:09:18,140 --> 02:09:19,760
KATE: Yeah, yeah. RYAN: We're the worst people.

3168
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,539
KRIS: "And then we're gonna come on in and yeah..." KATE: (laughs) We definitely are!

3169
02:09:22,539 --> 02:09:24,460
(laughter) KRIS: "It's not quite ready yet."

3170
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:27,020
KATE: Aww. JERRY: Let's see -- Do you have Performance?

3171
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:29,039
KRIS: I do, actually.

3172
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:30,979
KRIS: I have a bizarrely

3173
02:09:30,979 --> 02:09:32,339
high amount of Performance. JERRY: Let's see it!

3174
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:34,000
KRIS: OK let's try. (die clatters)

3175
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:37,439
KRIS: It's gonna be a 15.

3176
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:38,879
JERRY: (laughs) Alright.

3177
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,880
KRIS: Does that get it done? JERRY: He's like,

3178
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:45,039
JERRY: "So it's taken care of?"

3179
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:47,359
KRIS: "Oh, frie--it'll be just a moment."

3180
02:09:47,359 --> 02:09:48,579
"No worries."

3181
02:09:48,579 --> 02:09:50,180
(laughter) JERRY: "It's fine?"

3182
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:52,900
KRIS: "We'll wheel it in as soon as it's ready."

3183
02:09:52,899 --> 02:09:55,719
JERRY: (whispers) "Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum." Closes the door.

3184
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:57,840
KATE: (laughs) RYAN: Tip the hat.

3185
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,920
KRIS: Yeah. OK, so that's...?

3186
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,720
JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Go ahead and do some stuff.

3187
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:03,100
KRIS: Spin around...

3188
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:04,440
KATE: (laughs)

3189
02:10:04,439 --> 02:10:08,079
KRIS: and on the...ooo was he a...

3190
02:10:08,079 --> 02:10:11,420
I think the Hexed person, they're gone. Is that right?

3191
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:13,880
I don't remember who I cast it on, actually.

3192
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:14,800
JERRY: Dead.

3193
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:17,779
RYAN: No, no. I thought you cast it on the other guy. The guy who's hurting.

3194
02:10:17,779 --> 02:10:20,399
There's guy who's hurting, guy who's dead, and the main guy.

3195
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:23,799
KRIS: Yeah, I didn't touch the main guy. KATE: I think it's Bolts that you casted on.

3196
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:25,960
RYAN: Yeah you casted -- JERRY: It was Mr. Bolts.   KATE: Yeah.

3197
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:28,159
RYAN: You casted on Bolts. And Bolts is still alive. KRIS: That's right, that's right.   KATE: Right.

3198
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:29,699
AMY: Daggers is -- RYAN: Daggers is dead.   KATE: Daggers is dead.

3199
02:10:29,699 --> 02:10:30,979
KRIS: OK. KATE: Sword and Bolts are still alive.

3200
02:10:30,979 --> 02:10:32,259
RYAN: Mmhmm. KRIS: Alright well--Oh no, you're right.

3201
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:34,000
OK that's where I got the Hex. Yeah, he's dead.

3202
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,619
OK so I'm gonna go ahead and do

3203
02:10:35,619 --> 02:10:38,140
Dissonant Whispers on... JERRY: Jeez!

3204
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:43,460
KATE: (whispers) KRIS: Uh...the um...(lip smacking &amp; chomping sounds)

3205
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:45,460
RYAN: Take out the weak guy. JERRY: The paladin or the fighter?

3206
02:10:45,460 --> 02:10:46,880
KRIS: Should I murder the weak guy? RYAN: Just take out the weak guy,

3207
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,920
RYAN: so it's like we can all focus on one.

3208
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,980
KRIS: Good idea, OK. So I'm gonna go after that weakened one.

3209
02:10:50,979 --> 02:10:52,819
So let's see here... RYAN: Kill the adds.

3210
02:10:52,819 --> 02:10:55,340
♫ Num, num, num, nah! Wisdom saving throw! ♫

3211
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:56,260
JERRY: Mmhmm.

3212
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:58,820
AMY: Meanwhile, Jerry's looking around the book. Which I love.

3213
02:10:58,819 --> 02:11:00,139
RYAN: Yeah, JERRY: OK that is...

3214
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:01,880
KATE: Not a great sign. JERRY: not a great saving throw.

3215
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:03,400
KRIS: OK. I'm gonna enjoy that.

3216
02:11:03,399 --> 02:11:04,939
Oh I'm gonna leave that one on the table.

3217
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:09,420
AMY: Good thing you did. KRIS: That's gonna be 8 psychic damage.

3218
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:12,119
JERRY: K. KRIS: And he's gotta run away if he can.

3219
02:11:12,119 --> 02:11:13,439
AMY: And he pees his pants. RYAN: Yeah.

3220
02:11:13,439 --> 02:11:14,779
KRIS: And that little urine...

3221
02:11:14,779 --> 02:11:16,739
RYAN: Runs past the werewolf.

3222
02:11:16,739 --> 02:11:19,239
AMY: Pee drops. JERRY: So what is the nature of these whispers?

3223
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:21,039
KATE: (whispers) Whisper, whisper, whisper. RYAN: Dissident.

3224
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:22,100
KRIS: I whisper...

3225
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:24,220
JERRY: Dissident Whispers is a different spell.

3226
02:11:24,220 --> 02:11:27,800
KRIS: I whisper like, "You knew that this was fucked the second you set foot in here."

3227
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,119
KATE: OH! (laughter)

3228
02:11:29,119 --> 02:11:30,979
KRIS: "You knew you weren't gonna get anything done."

3229
02:11:31,319 --> 02:11:32,779
KATE: That's Dissonant as shit!

3230
02:11:32,779 --> 02:11:34,340
KRIS: "You'd be lucky to get out of here."

3231
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:36,220
JERRY: Yeah.   KATE: (whispers) Wow! KRIS: "You'd be lucky to be able to run away."

3232
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:38,460
JERRY: Yeah. So he takes a few...

3233
02:11:38,460 --> 02:11:40,039
Immediately...

3234
02:11:40,039 --> 02:11:43,039
eyes widen. He sweeps the hat...

3235
02:11:43,859 --> 02:11:45,500
off the back of his head.

3236
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:48,460
Tries to take a couple steps back down the stairs,

3237
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:50,760
slips on blood.

3238
02:11:51,399 --> 02:11:52,579
KATE: Nice. RYAN: Again not your fault.

3239
02:11:52,579 --> 02:11:54,319
RYAN:  We didn't really technically killed anyone yet.

3240
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,800
AMY: Well... JERRY: And his head connects --

3241
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,920
JERRY: with the stairs. RYAN: Well you did one.

3242
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:59,739
RYAN: That was nature taking its course. JERRY: And that's --

3243
02:11:59,739 --> 02:12:00,859
RYAN: That was a spider.

3244
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:03,140
AMY: It's fine. JERRY: Yeah.

3245
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:06,740
JERRY: (stammers) You're pretty sure you're not gonna have to deal with that much.

3246
02:12:06,739 --> 02:12:09,019
Unless he's transformed into a vampire.

3247
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:11,220
Then you have to deal with that. KRIS: I don't know. Yeah. We'll see.

3248
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:12,460
RYAN: Well then they'll pay us.

3249
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:14,060
JERRY: Alright.   KRIS: Alright, then I'll just go... RYAN: Like the rest of them.

3250
02:12:14,979 --> 02:12:16,339
JERRY: (laughs) Behold!

3251
02:12:18,119 --> 02:12:20,199
KATE: Ok. Bolts is out. KRIS: Chuck wagon is comin'!

3252
02:12:20,199 --> 02:12:22,279
RYAN: Yeah. KATE: Bolts is out. So it's just Sword.

3253
02:12:22,279 --> 02:12:23,399
KRIS: Just sword guy.   KATE: Cool. JERRY: Mmhmm.

3254
02:12:23,399 --> 02:12:24,379
RYAN: Web up Swordy.

3255
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:26,940
AMY: So... JERRY: Alright. So that is K'thriss Drow'b.

3256
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:28,299
Now it's the Nut.

3257
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:30,119
AMY: I look in there, and I'm like,

3258
02:12:30,939 --> 02:12:32,259
"They have it under control."

3259
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:33,199
(laughter)

3260
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:35,139
And so I am going to...

3261
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:38,520
It's just 3 on 1 at that point, I'm like, "Oof. OK..."

3262
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,780
"What would I really be adding to it at this point?"

3263
02:12:40,779 --> 02:12:44,899
I love the idea of the spider, (bored) "Just checking that it's OK. Whatever."

3264
02:12:44,899 --> 02:12:46,799
RYAN: Break a window and then walk away.

3265
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,520
(laughter)

3266
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:53,280
AMY: So Walnut's gonna use my movement

3267
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:57,739
to skitter down and then turn back into Walnut,

3268
02:12:57,739 --> 02:13:01,719
and use my action to talk to Trevor real quick.

3269
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:05,698
JERRY: You're just gonna go out and sit on this rock? AMY: That's what --

3270
02:13:05,698 --> 02:13:08,440
You looked at me during the last turn. You were... RYAN: Hey, what up, buddy?

3271
02:13:08,439 --> 02:13:09,339
AMY: like, "What's wrong with you?" KRIS: What were you doing? Yeah.

3272
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:10,619
AMY: And I was thinking like,

3273
02:13:10,619 --> 02:13:12,199
I've been that werewolf at a party.

3274
02:13:12,199 --> 02:13:13,639
(laughter) RYAN: Oh my God.

3275
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,780
How you doing, champ?

3276
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,980
KRIS: I love the trust. RYAN: How's it goin'?

3277
02:13:16,979 --> 02:13:18,419
KRIS: Where you're like, "They got it."

3278
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:19,420
"I'm gonna go deal with this."

3279
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:21,079
RYAN: I love that you trust the werewolf too. Like...

3280
02:13:21,079 --> 02:13:23,039
AMY: I don't trust the werewolf. RYAN: he's friendly.

3281
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:24,380
AMY &amp; KATE: He's sad. KRIS: He's just...yeah.

3282
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:27,980
AMY: OK and so Walnut will just go up to him

3283
02:13:27,979 --> 02:13:30,219
and then say...

3284
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:33,420
I'll say, "Hey friend."

3285
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:35,880
"Is there any reason why --" RYAN: You have to call him Champ.

3286
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:36,980
(laughter)

3287
02:13:36,979 --> 02:13:39,659
KATE: Sport. Little Buddy. AMY: "Hey. Hey, bud."

3288
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:41,800
KRIS: Why the (howls) loooooong face?

3289
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:44,699
(laughter) - "Why aren't you at the party?"

3290
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:49,039
- (slurred Southern drawl in gentle voice) "I mean I should be able to go in that there pardy."

3291
02:13:49,039 --> 02:13:52,560
"My cousin owns the Doomgate Inn."

3292
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:56,240
"He get into all kinds of vampire..."

3293
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:58,800
"mess and whatnot."

3294
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,840
AMY: Mmhmm. KATE: (stifles laughter)

3295
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:03,220
JERRY: "Can't come to them parties no more."

3296
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:05,980
AMY: "Ah...so..." JERRY: "We was like brothers!"

3297
02:14:05,979 --> 02:14:07,699
KRIS: Mmm. AMY: Mmm.

3298
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:11,380
AMY: "Was he like you?" JERRY: "Now he's drinking the blood of the livin'."

3299
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:13,840
AMY: Mmm JERRY: "Whatever."

3300
02:14:14,539 --> 02:14:17,460
AMY: Hmm JERRY: "What have you."

3301
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:19,780
KATE: So forth. AMY: "Well..."

3302
02:14:19,779 --> 02:14:21,420
KATE: (laughs) RYAN: Et cetera...

3303
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:23,520
JERRY: "And so on and so forth."

3304
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,040
AMY: Well so Walnut will be like,

3305
02:14:26,039 --> 02:14:28,119
"Well I know what's like to --"

3306
02:14:28,119 --> 02:14:30,099
JERRY: "I've tried to go into them parties."

3307
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:32,100
"I come into the party. Got a cloak on."

3308
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:34,480
AMY: "I know --" JERRY: "Say, 'I'm a vampire, y'all!'"

3309
02:14:34,479 --> 02:14:38,299
AMY: "I know what it's like to be a outsider." JERRY: "I didn't get no good goddamn!"

3310
02:14:38,939 --> 02:14:40,599
AMY: OK, and then at this point

3311
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:42,120
Walnut's gonna say, "Well..."

3312
02:14:42,119 --> 02:14:43,519
KATE: (sobbing laughter)

3313
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:46,000
AMY: "I surely know --" JERRY: "I'm just trying to do..."

3314
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,680
AMY: "what would impress your cousin."

3315
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:49,700
KATE: (laughing) You can't get a word in edgewise. AMY: No! That's why --

3316
02:14:49,699 --> 02:14:50,519
KATE: He's just troll-- AMY: I'm just gonna try --

3317
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:52,520
AMY: I'm gonna try. He might not bite. But he might bite.

3318
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:53,760
I'm gonna go,

3319
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:57,440
"Well right now on the stairs of your cousin's inn,"

3320
02:14:57,439 --> 02:14:59,419
"is a vampire hunter."

3321
02:14:59,819 --> 02:15:02,739
"Which I'm sure he doesn't like very much." JERRY: "Get. Out. Of. Town!"

3322
02:15:02,739 --> 02:15:04,300
AMY: "And I'm willing to bet..."

3323
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:06,560
JERRY: "Them's was vampire hunters. I wonderin' why they had them...

3324
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:07,840
toothpicks."

3325
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:10,800
KATE: (giggles) AMY: "I'm willing to bet if someone..."

3326
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,659
AMY: "were to dispose of them..."

3327
02:15:12,659 --> 02:15:13,779
KATE: (whispers) Fuck.

3328
02:15:13,779 --> 02:15:16,519
AMY: "maybe...they can get into the party." JERRY: "They had...must have been five..."

3329
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:19,200
JERRY: "Must have been five or six of them toothpicks!"

3330
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:21,679
KATE: (laughs) AMY: "They're lousy with toothpicks, my friend."

3331
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:23,440
AMY: "You are not wrong."

3332
02:15:23,439 --> 02:15:26,879
"I'm just saying, if you wanted to help out,"

3333
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:29,560
"they might be more inclined to let you into the party."

3334
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:30,800
KATE: (whispers) Oh my God.

3335
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:33,260
AMY: "Something to think about." JERRY: "You make an..."

3336
02:15:33,699 --> 02:15:35,579
JERRY: "You talk a lot of sense."

3337
02:15:35,579 --> 02:15:37,659
KRIS: (chortles) AMY: "I'm just looking out for you."

3338
02:15:37,659 --> 02:15:39,500
"I've been in your shoes."

3339
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:42,359
JERRY: "You talk a lot of sense. Now the problem..."

3340
02:15:42,359 --> 02:15:43,960
"as I see it is that..."

3341
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:46,819
JERRY: "once I get to tastin'..." AMY: Mmm.

3342
02:15:46,819 --> 02:15:48,359
JERRY: "the blood, I get..."

3343
02:15:48,359 --> 02:15:50,739
"I get very excited about it."

3344
02:15:50,739 --> 02:15:52,179
AMY: Hmm... RYAN: (sighs)

3345
02:15:52,579 --> 02:15:54,939
AMY: "I see." JERRY: "I'm an ENTHUSIAST!"

3346
02:15:54,939 --> 02:15:56,779
AMY: "Well, so are vampires."

3347
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:00,000
JERRY: "Maybe that's somethin' he and I have in common!"

3348
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,579
AMY: "Yeah you could talk about that."

3349
02:16:01,939 --> 02:16:03,899
"Maybe you just got to talk about it."

3350
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:05,480
JERRY: "Yeah..."

3351
02:16:05,899 --> 02:16:09,000
"You know, I think you might be right!"

3352
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,960
KATE &amp; KRIS: (whispering to each other) AMY: "Yeah. I am right."

3353
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:13,460
And then I say it a little bit louder,

3354
02:16:13,460 --> 02:16:15,100
and I look back even though I know they can't hear me, and I'm gonna go,

3355
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:17,660
"I am right!" (laughter)

3356
02:16:18,359 --> 02:16:20,460
JERRY: "Well, I feel like..."

3357
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:22,340
"I feel like we learned a lot."

3358
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:24,020
RYAN: (snorts and laughs)

3359
02:16:24,020 --> 02:16:26,680
JERRY: "I feel like this was a very special time."

3360
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:28,539
AMY: "Yeah." I'm like -- JERRY: "For both of us!"

3361
02:16:28,539 --> 02:16:30,079
AMY: "Oh, definitely."

3362
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:31,500
"I mean, me too."

3363
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:32,979
KATE: I think you could like...

3364
02:16:33,559 --> 02:16:35,279
KRIS: Lean in? KATE: Get him. Yeah, get it.

3365
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:36,780
AMY: (uncomfortable) Uh... (laughter)

3366
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:38,500
AMY: Yeah, when he starts going like that,

3367
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:39,979
Walnut's like, "Yup!"

3368
02:16:39,979 --> 02:16:41,039
JERRY: Yeah exactly. KATE: (laughs)

3369
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,680
AMY: Shut it down. KRIS: Yeah.

3370
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:44,220
JERRY: Prom's coming up.

3371
02:16:44,219 --> 02:16:45,019
(laughter)

3372
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:46,500
AMY: Yeah, no. Walnut's immediately like,

3373
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:48,840
"(clears throat) OK. Well...umm..."

3374
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:51,479
"Glad you're feeling a little bit better. And, you know..."

3375
02:16:51,479 --> 02:16:52,840
"door's right there if you wanna..."

3376
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:54,059
"help your cousin out."

3377
02:16:54,059 --> 02:16:57,219
JERRY: "Here I'll be back in just a couple of minutes."

3378
02:16:57,219 --> 02:17:01,779
"They won't...I...these is tools of DESTRUCTION!"

3379
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:04,819
AMY: Obviously. And then Walnut goes,

3380
02:17:05,399 --> 02:17:07,799
"I know. I know."

3381
02:17:07,799 --> 02:17:09,519
"I know a little a little more than--I get it."

3382
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:11,399
KRIS: Oh! Oh...

3383
02:17:11,399 --> 02:17:12,699
KRIS: Wow. KATE: Do you wanna show him?

3384
02:17:12,700 --> 02:17:13,700
KRIS: Oh my God. AMY: I can't.

3385
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:15,280
AMY: I did--I already did it.

3386
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:16,280
JERRY: I just did it. I already did it.

3387
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:18,640
KRIS: Dang. I love it!   RYAN: Yeah. AMY: Well...no I can't.

3388
02:17:18,639 --> 02:17:20,199
JERRY: Refractory period. AMY: Wait...it's a bonus.

3389
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:22,000
AMY: But I can't do it. No, that was a long turn.

3390
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,200
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. KATE: Fuck it.

3391
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,200
JERRY: No listen, that was not a long turn,

3392
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:27,000
that turn was the right fucking length!

3393
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
AMY: Yeah, OK. KATE: What if you...

3394
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,840
AMY: It's OK. KATE: (whispers) What if you could talk Jerry into it.

3395
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:31,940
AMY: It's OK.   KRIS: No, no, no. JERRY: You're trying...   AMY: I'm like, "Trevor --"

3396
02:17:31,940 --> 02:17:33,360
KRIS: Don't, don't... AMY: There's not enough guys.

3397
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:35,000
RYAN: Don't muddy the waters. KRIS: You gotta leave him wanting more, yeah.

3398
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:36,460
JERRY: Alright now.

3399
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,840
Donaar.

3400
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:40,020
(stammers) That was Walnut.

3401
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:41,940
Now we're back to Rosie Beestinger. KRIS: And I heard the whole thing, and it's just been like,

3402
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:42,620
KRIS: "Oh my god." KATE: OK.

3403
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:43,620
JERRY: It's you...

3404
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:45,220
and a combatant. RYAN: It's like, I can't wait for the next combatant

3405
02:17:45,219 --> 02:17:46,459
RYAN: to come in here. KATE: Yeah.

3406
02:17:46,459 --> 02:17:48,699
KATE: And I'm st--am I still standing behind him?

3407
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:51,300
JERRY: You are lower on the staircase than he is.

3408
02:17:51,299 --> 02:17:53,099
He is between you and Donaar.

3409
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:54,260
KATE: And which way is he facing?

3410
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:57,659
JERRY: Right now he can easily contend with both of you.

3411
02:17:57,659 --> 02:18:00,280
This is a professional combatant. RYAN: Hmm.   KATE: OK.

3412
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:03,380
JERRY: He kills people, basically, as a job. Literally monsters.

3413
02:18:03,379 --> 02:18:04,639
KRIS: (laughs) KATE: OK.

3414
02:18:06,819 --> 02:18:09,260
KATE: I want to Yoda the shit out of this.

3415
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:11,559
JERRY: He's like the Gobot version of the Witcher.

3416
02:18:11,559 --> 02:18:14,559
Right? He's like not the Witcher, but he's like Witcher-adjacent.

3417
02:18:14,559 --> 02:18:15,920
KATE: The Gobot version...

3418
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:17,799
JERRY: He's like Rock Lords. KRIS: The Witchmen.

3419
02:18:17,799 --> 02:18:19,719
JERRY: (laughs)   KATE: Yeah. AMY: How dare you!

3420
02:18:19,719 --> 02:18:21,899
AMY: It's a rich franchise!

3421
02:18:21,899 --> 02:18:23,079
JERRY: The Witchster!

3422
02:18:23,079 --> 02:18:24,440
(laughter)

3423
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:26,159
JERRY: It's alright. Look, please continue.

3424
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:29,399
KATE: I'm gonna--I'd like to...

3425
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:34,060
take the opportunity to-- I love staircase bannisters;

3426
02:18:34,059 --> 02:18:35,639
I'm going to...

3427
02:18:35,639 --> 02:18:36,699
JERRY: Go ham.

3428
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:38,100
KATE: Yeah, gonna go ham on the bannister... JERRY: John Hamm.

3429
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:39,319
KATE: John Hamm, obviously.

3430
02:18:39,319 --> 02:18:41,639
I'm gonna jump on the bannister that's closest to the wall

3431
02:18:41,639 --> 02:18:44,920
and try to parkour my way off of the wall

3432
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:48,120
into a--just any angle that he might not expect.

3433
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:49,540
KRIS: Hmm. KATE: And with both feet.

3434
02:18:49,540 --> 02:18:51,620
KATE: Just unarmed attacks...

3435
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:53,460
with my feet. JERRY: Just...just...?

3436
02:18:53,459 --> 02:18:56,139
JERRY: Like some WWE dropkick type stuff? KATE: Definitely yeah.

3437
02:18:56,139 --> 02:18:59,000
- I'm gonna try to get my nasty little Hobbit feet right in his...

3438
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,319
[JERRY] Right in his zone? [KATE] Yeah.

3439
02:19:00,319 --> 02:19:01,760
KRIS: Oh yes.   KATE: Right in the mouth. RYAN: Aim for the haunch.

3440
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:04,200
KATE: Right in his face haunch. RYAN: Yeah.

3441
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,200
KATE: As much as I can. JERRY: OK.

3442
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:07,320
- Acrobatics?

3443
02:19:07,319 --> 02:19:08,680
KRIS: Blast the haunch.   RYAN: (laughs) JERRY: (stammers) Hold on.

3444
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:10,420
JERRY: Is this about you getting Advantage? KRIS: Blast the haunch.

3445
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:11,659
- Eh. I didn't ask for it.

3446
02:19:11,659 --> 02:19:14,819
But of course I'll take it. I'd be delighted! KRIS: Wow.

3447
02:19:14,819 --> 02:19:16,840
KATE: (laughs) JERRY: This is going to be a regular attack with...

3448
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:18,840
KATE: That's fine. That's fine. JERRY: In fact it's actually going to

3449
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:20,040
KATE: Aww! JERRY: be with Disadvantage.

3450
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:21,620
- Aww...beans!

3451
02:19:21,620 --> 02:19:22,720
JERRY: Bam! RYAN: Aww!

3452
02:19:22,719 --> 02:19:24,679
- Just because I brought Pat's name into it.

3453
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:27,280
- Yeah, exactly. I'll punish the entire lineage.

3454
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:28,920
RYAN: I'll punish the IDEA of Pat.

3455
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:30,299
(laughter)

3456
02:19:30,299 --> 02:19:33,119
KATE: Jeez. Fucking Pat Rothfuss. JERRY: He's on here ONE time...

3457
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,520
KATE: OK. JERRY: thinks he runs the fucking place.

3458
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:36,440
KATE: Now Acrobatics first?

3459
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:38,739
Do you want me to take the Disadvantage on my Acrobatics roll?

3460
02:19:38,739 --> 02:19:40,600
Or just like, take that for granted? JERRY: Just the attack. Do the attack.

3461
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:42,180
(die clatters)   KATE: Alright. JERRY: It's fine. This is not going to be super hard.

3462
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:43,860
KATE: That was an 18. (die clatters) KRIS: OK.

3463
02:19:43,860 --> 02:19:45,340
KATE: And that was a 20!

3464
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:47,180
JERRY: Oh! What? KRIS: Wha...!   RYAN: Wah wah!

3465
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:48,739
KATE: Looks like somebody might have wasted

3466
02:19:48,739 --> 02:19:49,739
KATE: his Disadvantage! JERRY: QQ.

3467
02:19:49,739 --> 02:19:50,979
JERRY: Do you have the air horn?

3468
02:19:52,299 --> 02:19:52,979
QQ: (faintly) Yup.

3469
02:19:52,979 --> 02:19:54,920
JERRY: Thank you. KATE: (meekly) Thank you.

3470
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:55,719
JERRY: I appreciate it. (air horn sound)

3471
02:19:55,719 --> 02:19:57,199
(air horn sound)

3472
02:19:57,200 --> 02:20:00,180
(everyone talking over one another)

3473
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:01,899
JERRY: So go ahead and roll the damage dice.

3474
02:20:01,899 --> 02:20:04,219
The bonus to stay, but roll the damage dice twice.

3475
02:20:04,219 --> 02:20:05,579
That's great news. KATE: OK. Great.

3476
02:20:05,579 --> 02:20:07,000
(die clatters) KATE: So that's a 7.

3477
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,959
(die clatters) And a 4.

3478
02:20:08,959 --> 02:20:11,119
And that's--I did not attack with my quarterstaff.

3479
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:12,820
I just attacked with both feet.

3480
02:20:12,819 --> 02:20:15,059
KRIS: Bleugh bleugh. RYAN: Kyaa kyaa!

3481
02:20:15,059 --> 02:20:16,379
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. KRIS: Yeah.

3482
02:20:16,379 --> 02:20:17,819
KATE: Uh so... JERRY: You just booted him.

3483
02:20:17,819 --> 02:20:19,360
RYAN: Bicycle kick in midair. KATE: Yeah so that's...

3484
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:22,100
KATE: 7 and 4 is a total of 11. JERRY: Liu Kang.   RYAN: Yeah, Liu Kang.

3485
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:24,680
KATE: 11 damage right to his tee--teeth and nose.

3486
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:25,899
AMY: Right to his teat?!?

3487
02:20:25,899 --> 02:20:27,479
KATE: Yeah.   RYAN: Right to his teats. JERRY: Right to his teat!   KATE: Teats.

3488
02:20:27,479 --> 02:20:29,059
RYAN: Teats.   AMY: (laughs) JERRY: Right to his ample teat!

3489
02:20:29,059 --> 02:20:30,239
(laughter)

3490
02:20:30,239 --> 02:20:32,340
AMY: Right in my teats! (laughter)

3491
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:34,420
JERRY: The T-Zone. AMY: My teat!

3492
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:35,739
JERRY: Absolutely. RYAN: Where he nurses.

3493
02:20:35,739 --> 02:20:37,699
JERRY: Exact-- (laughs)   KRIS: No longer. KATE: If a tooth...

3494
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:39,760
KATE: If a tooth flies out... KRIS: Never again.

3495
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:41,760
JERRY: You're fine with it. You catch it! KATE: I'm going to catch it.

3496
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:45,380
JERRY: If a tooth flies out, that counts as a ranged attack.

3497
02:20:45,379 --> 02:20:47,979
KATE: And I can use my Deflect Missile. Yeah. RYAN: You catch it and throw it, yeah.

3498
02:20:47,979 --> 02:20:49,639
KATE: And throw it right back in his fucking eyeball. RYAN: Right in his eye.

3499
02:20:49,639 --> 02:20:51,039
KRIS: You throw it back in his socket! KATE: Teeth?

3500
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:53,660
JERRY: No, no, no teeth. You catch him straight in the chest.

3501
02:20:53,659 --> 02:20:54,899
KATE: This game sucks!

3502
02:20:54,899 --> 02:20:56,079
(laughter)

3503
02:20:56,079 --> 02:20:59,860
JERRY: And you push him back up against the bannister.

3504
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:02,280
KATE: K. JERRY: And it is at this point that he

3505
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:04,079
turns his full fury on you instead.

3506
02:21:04,079 --> 02:21:05,000
KATE: Fine.

3507
02:21:06,059 --> 02:21:07,519
KRIS: And he dives at you. RYAN: I catch his bicuspid.

3508
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:09,120
(laughter) RYAN: Throw it right in his pee-hole.

3509
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:10,040
(laughter)

3510
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:11,860
JERRY: No, no. Like a cork! RYAN: Yeah.

3511
02:21:11,860 --> 02:21:12,720
(laughter)

3512
02:21:12,719 --> 02:21:13,739
JERRY: And then it's like... KRIS: He looks urinating.

3513
02:21:13,739 --> 02:21:15,819
JERRY: No, no, no. I meant it's like a...

3514
02:21:15,819 --> 02:21:19,579
like a...clown balloon animal. RYAN: Guh!

3515
02:21:19,579 --> 02:21:21,239
JERRY: It's just infla--It starts here!

3516
02:21:21,239 --> 02:21:22,940
And then it goes out and then... KRIS: (deflating balloon sound)

3517
02:21:23,659 --> 02:21:24,739
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: It's gone.

3518
02:21:24,739 --> 02:21:27,020
JERRY: That doesn't happen. RYAN: It only t--it does 1d8.

3519
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:28,880
KATE: It's just 1d8.  JERRY: Aww...sh--! (laughs) RYAN: It's not even that much.

3520
02:21:28,879 --> 02:21:30,399
KATE: Yeah? What'd you roll? KRIS: No, I like your..

3521
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:31,559
KATE: What'd you roll, Jerr-Bear?

3522
02:21:31,559 --> 02:21:33,239
JERRY: 2. KATE: Ah yes. I like it!

3523
02:21:33,239 --> 02:21:35,539
JERRY: Gooddamn it. KATE: My Armor Class is higher than 2.

3524
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,820
AMY: (kissing fingers sounds) JERRY: His damage is so...

3525
02:21:36,819 --> 02:21:38,879
JERRY: Oh. His damage is so... RYAN Yeah. It's everyone else.

3526
02:21:38,879 --> 02:21:41,159
JERRY: His damage is so high. RYAN: For me it's like, "Oh nat 20's."

3527
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:43,100
JERRY: His damage is so high. Donaar Blit'zen.

3528
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:44,600
AMY: What? Alright.

3529
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:46,800
RYAN: OK, so he swings and missies.

3530
02:21:46,799 --> 02:21:49,179
So, she knocked him off balance into the bannister.

3531
02:21:49,180 --> 02:21:52,159
JERRY: Yeah. RYAN: He then swings so comically poorly,

3532
02:21:52,159 --> 02:21:54,059
is he off-balance with his back to me? JERRY: No...

3533
02:21:54,059 --> 02:21:55,779
RYAN: Do I have any sort of Advantage here? JERRY: Duh, do I win?

3534
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:56,940
RYAN: It feels like he's flailing around.

3535
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:59,079
KATE: See? See what I taught them how to do? JERRY: Yeah.

3536
02:21:59,079 --> 02:22:00,979
JERRY: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. RYAN: I don't know...

3537
02:22:00,979 --> 02:22:04,159
RYAN: In the picture--the beautiful picture you painted with your words, might I add.

3538
02:22:04,159 --> 02:22:05,520
RYAN: Just marvelous. KATE: Gorgeous!

3539
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:08,440
RYAN: Uh...gor--yeah. I feel like in my mind,

3540
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:11,079
what has been described, he's like half over the bannister...

3541
02:22:11,079 --> 02:22:13,420
KATE: Yeah. Maybe almost about to fall... RYAN: on one leg, swinging wild!

3542
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:15,299
KRIS: Suicidal! Probably jumping off. KATE: Right, right. Yeah.   RYAN: Yeah.

3543
02:22:15,299 --> 02:22:17,439
KRIS: He can't stand it. RYAN: He's lost all will to fight...

3544
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:20,040
RYAN: This is what I'm getting. KRIS: He's got a tooth in his urethra.

3545
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:22,160
(laughter)   KRIS: He doesn't want to live. RYAN: He's got a pee-tooth!

3546
02:22:22,159 --> 02:22:23,659
RYAN: No one wants a pee-tooth.

3547
02:22:23,659 --> 02:22:25,299
RYAN: Alright. Fine. JERRY: Alright so.  So what's next?

3548
02:22:25,299 --> 02:22:27,420
RYAN: Daddy gonna bring out...

3549
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:28,639
RYAN: Toothbrush. JERRY: The Toothbrush?

3550
02:22:28,639 --> 02:22:29,719
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: Let's hear it.

3551
02:22:30,159 --> 02:22:32,479
RYAN: So...Toothbrush the sword.

3552
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:33,959
KRIS: Right.   JERRY: Yeah I know. KATE: We know.   RYAN: OK.

3553
02:22:33,959 --> 02:22:34,979
JERRY: Percival is the...(laughs)

3554
02:22:34,979 --> 02:22:36,579
(Jerry, Ryan, and Kris talking over one another) JERRY: Percival is the toothbrush.

3555
02:22:36,579 --> 02:22:38,360
AMY: The audience might have forgotten. RYAN: Yeah.   KRIS: Good practice.

3556
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:40,079
JERRY: Listen, we know the brand. RYAN: Alright.

3557
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:44,239
RYAN: And...I'm goin' for...

3558
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,819
Big Daddy swing.

3559
02:22:45,819 --> 02:22:48,159
KRIS: Mmhmm. RYAN: I think of my egg back at home.

3560
02:22:48,159 --> 02:22:49,940
RYAN: Say, "This is for you."

3561
02:22:49,940 --> 02:22:51,980
Brings--gives me strength. KATE: Eggo.

3562
02:22:51,979 --> 02:22:53,859
RYAN: I go...(hums) AMY: Cats in the Cradle starts playing.

3563
02:22:53,860 --> 02:22:56,840
RYAN: (grunts/grumbles "Cats in the Cradle") ♫ And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon ♫

3564
02:22:56,840 --> 02:22:59,739
KATE: I mean maybe before we go Harry Chapin you wanna make that roll.

3565
02:22:59,739 --> 02:23:00,879
(laughter) RYAN: Yeah.

3566
02:23:00,879 --> 02:23:03,039
KRIS: You can't RP that roll. RYAN: But I'm so...

3567
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:04,820
RYAN: like... filled with...

3568
02:23:04,819 --> 02:23:06,860
like...like love for the egg...

3569
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:08,400
that I probably get Advantage, right?

3570
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:10,299
(laughter)

3571
02:23:10,299 --> 02:23:11,739
KRIS: But I do roll... RYAN: No...?

3572
02:23:11,739 --> 02:23:13,440
RYAN: Alright. Can't get Disadvantage...

3573
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:15,159
JERRY: You are playing-- you are fucking with powers

3574
02:23:15,159 --> 02:23:17,159
you can't even POSSIBLY comprehend. RYAN: Yeah.

3575
02:23:17,159 --> 02:23:19,459
RYAN: I know. KRIS: I roll a 15 or higher, I roll a 20.

3576
02:23:19,459 --> 02:23:21,439
KRIS: I RP the high roll.

3577
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:22,780
RYAN: Alright. (die clatters)

3578
02:23:22,780 --> 02:23:23,880
AMY: Whoop.

3579
02:23:23,879 --> 02:23:25,239
RYAN: It's a 2!

3580
02:23:25,239 --> 02:23:27,360
Plus 5. It's a 7.

3581
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:29,540
JERRY: That's too low. KRIS: ♫ And the cat's in the cradle ♫

3582
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:30,820
(laughter) JERRY: It's too low.

3583
02:23:30,819 --> 02:23:32,139
KRIS: It's all wrong it's like,

3584
02:23:32,139 --> 02:23:34,439
♫ And the dog's in there in my house ♫

3585
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:35,500
(laughter)

3586
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:37,879
RYAN: I swing and miss and there's just like a record scratch.

3587
02:23:37,879 --> 02:23:39,279
It's like on my face. It's like,

3588
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:41,480
Yeah It's me, Donaar. You're probably wondering how I got here.

3589
02:23:41,479 --> 02:23:44,180
(laughter)

3590
02:23:44,180 --> 02:23:45,300
RYAN: (record scratch sound)

3591
02:23:45,299 --> 02:23:46,340
JERRY: So.

3592
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:47,880
You...

3593
02:23:47,879 --> 02:23:50,420
You swing just straight over the top.

3594
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:53,059
Like around the bannister. Gets kinda stuck in the wood.

3595
02:23:53,059 --> 02:23:54,279
RYAN: It's cuz he's so off-balance.

3596
02:23:54,280 --> 02:23:55,860
It throws me off-balance. JERRY: Exactly. Yeah, you got fucked up

3597
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:57,140
KATE: You blame him? JERRY: As a result.   RYAN: Yeah.

3598
02:23:57,139 --> 02:23:58,659
KATE: You coulda just stood still! (laughs)

3599
02:23:58,659 --> 02:24:00,319
KATE: (laughs) JERRY: Why couldn't ya?

3600
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:02,799
JERRY: It is at this moment, Donaar,

3601
02:24:02,799 --> 02:24:05,359
AMY: Uh oh. JERRY: that a mighty foot

3602
02:24:05,639 --> 02:24:07,840
JERRY: kicks the front door in.

3603
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,380
AMY: There's my T-Bone!

3604
02:24:09,379 --> 02:24:10,500
(laughter) JERRY: To...

3605
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,420
KATE: T-Bone! AMY: (howls) Ha-wooo!

3606
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:14,040
JERRY: No, exactly. There is...

3607
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:16,700
There is a howl. And it is not a comical howl.

3608
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:18,159
KRIS: Oh...   AMY: Uh oh. RYAN: Oh God.

3609
02:24:18,159 --> 02:24:19,979
JERRY: It is -- AMY: Think he could do me one better?

3610
02:24:19,979 --> 02:24:21,739
JERRY: It is a musical...

3611
02:24:21,739 --> 02:24:22,860
AMY: Oh. RYAN: ♫ Oh... ♫

3612
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:24,780
JERRY: Yeah. It is a musical howl.

3613
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:28,480
RYAN: "I said, Trevor, I said get the goddamn F out of here!"

3614
02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:30,439
(laughter) "Not gonna repeat myself!"

3615
02:24:31,379 --> 02:24:35,459
JERRY: (stammers) He covers the space from the door

3616
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:38,899
to the stairs, on all fours.

3617
02:24:38,899 --> 02:24:40,539
RYAN: Hmm. JERRY: Just loping...

3618
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:42,900
JERRY: Just--you don't know how it's happening.

3619
02:24:42,899 --> 02:24:45,279
He seems to be rolling there, almost.

3620
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:47,400
RYAN: You're gonna make me fight this...thing.

3621
02:24:47,399 --> 02:24:48,799
AMY: Naw. RYAN: He's gonna get --

3622
02:24:48,799 --> 02:24:50,459
KATE: He's on our side, but you don't know that.

3623
02:24:50,459 --> 02:24:53,119
RYAN: He's gonna get bloodlust the second he murders this thing.

3624
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,940
AMY: It's fine. I've...I'll plan.

3625
02:24:56,379 --> 02:24:58,519
KATE: (whispers) If he asks you to prom, you have to say yes.

3626
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:00,140
RYAN: Yeah. JERRY: Yeah, I'm...sorry.

3627
02:25:00,139 --> 02:25:02,000
JERRY: We don't make the rules. KATE: (laughs)

3628
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,639
RYAN: I'm gonna Command...

3629
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:06,620
KATE: I asked Chris Perkins about it when we were at Wizards.

3630
02:25:06,620 --> 02:25:09,300
I was like, "Does she have to say yes if he asks her to prom?" And he said yes.

3631
02:25:09,299 --> 02:25:10,859
RYAN: Well if Chris said it. KATE: It's just...

3632
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:12,040
AMY: Well... JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

3633
02:25:12,479 --> 02:25:13,799
JERRY: (clears throat) Umm he...

3634
02:25:13,799 --> 02:25:14,579
he...

3635
02:25:15,659 --> 02:25:18,360
lopes up the bottom of the stairs...

3636
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:19,680
and then...

3637
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,139
like just pushes you aside.

3638
02:25:22,139 --> 02:25:23,399
KATE: Gently? JERRY: Gently.

3639
02:25:23,399 --> 02:25:24,959
KATE: That's so sweet. OK. JERRY: He's not mean. He's not mean.

3640
02:25:24,959 --> 02:25:27,000
RYAN: He caresses... JERRY: He just barrels into him

3641
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,340
JERRY: and is just on his chest like this.

3642
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:33,579
He deals damage. You can see his claws flexing in his fingers.

3643
02:25:33,579 --> 02:25:35,959
But he does not kill the foe.

3644
02:25:35,959 --> 02:25:37,199
K'thriss Drow'b.

3645
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,680
AMY: But now he's knocked prone.

3646
02:25:39,180 --> 02:25:41,200
KRIS: Umm... RYAN: I can get two for one on that...

3647
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:43,040
JERRY: (laughs)

3648
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:45,860
Just this--it's like on top of a club sandwich. Just like the --

3649
02:25:46,579 --> 02:25:48,319
KRIS: Is this guy--how's this guy looking?

3650
02:25:48,319 --> 02:25:49,579
RYAN: I warned him to get the hell out of...

3651
02:25:49,579 --> 02:25:50,840
KRIS: Pretty sour? JERRY: He's not...

3652
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:52,979
JERRY: He's not ready for...He's not ready.

3653
02:25:52,979 --> 02:25:54,059
He's having a bad day.

3654
02:25:54,059 --> 02:25:55,019
KATE: Not ready for his close up?

3655
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:57,040
KRIS: OK. Umm... (smacks lips)

3656
02:25:57,459 --> 02:25:59,839
KRIS: I'm just gonna...reach up...

3657
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:02,399
and grab another one of these stars. JERRY: Yeah. Fling it?

3658
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:03,180
KRIS: And fling it.

3659
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:04,079
KRIS: Yeah. KATE: Yum yum.

3660
02:26:04,079 --> 02:26:06,659
KRIS: Toss it. Umm...Mmm (smacks lips)

3661
02:26:06,659 --> 02:26:08,879
RYAN: From your K'thlasp. KRIS: Let me grab these.

3662
02:26:08,879 --> 02:26:10,019
(die clatters)

3663
02:26:10,340 --> 02:26:12,880
AMY: Ooo.   KRIS: That's going to be 10. KATE: Oh my God.   AMY: Big money.

3664
02:26:12,879 --> 02:26:14,219
JERRY: Jesus! KRIS: That's going to be 10.

3665
02:26:14,219 --> 02:26:15,679
JERRY: That's not why I gave it to you.

3666
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:18,880
I gave it to you so you can do real da-- you can deal 3 or 4 damage...

3667
02:26:18,879 --> 02:26:21,420
RYAN: Mmhmm.   JERRY: Tops. KRIS: That's what my actual attack does.

3668
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:23,000
(laughter)   KRIS: It's 1d10. JERRY: Exactly.

3669
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,200
KRIS: It's not great.

3670
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:26,620
JERRY: (stammers) This time you seen how it works.

3671
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:27,960
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: You experiment with it.

3672
02:26:27,959 --> 02:26:29,379
JERRY: You throw it even higher

3673
02:26:29,379 --> 02:26:31,759
and it seeks the target of your choice.

3674
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:35,520
So wherever you throw it, it can find targets.

3675
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:39,200
And it seeks them out with these structures it creates.

3676
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:40,220
KRIS: Yeah.

3677
02:26:40,219 --> 02:26:44,619
JERRY: That...yeah. Those pierce him through.

3678
02:26:45,579 --> 02:26:47,559
KRIS: I'm gonna -- JERRY: He collapses on the stairs.

3679
02:26:47,559 --> 02:26:49,399
KRIS: As a little flavor, I'm gonna pierce--

3680
02:26:49,399 --> 02:26:52,600
let's do it right at his claw points.

3681
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:54,159
(whispers) So he thinks he did it!

3682
02:26:54,159 --> 02:26:56,139
AMY &amp; KATE: Awww... RYAN: Ugh.

3683
02:26:56,139 --> 02:26:57,680
KATE: That's so sweet!

3684
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,680
KRIS: "Cuz I heard you guys talking." JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

3685
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:04,380
AMY: He did.   KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: Yeah, he--Trevor stands up

3686
02:27:04,379 --> 02:27:07,939
over the top of his foe and he looks at

3687
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:11,340
his massive paws that -- RYAN: You made him think he's a murderer.

3688
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:15,340
JERRY: that apparently have a power he never knew.

3689
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:18,200
Almost certainly connected with

3690
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:21,880
the incredible pep talk

3691
02:27:21,879 --> 02:27:24,519
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: received in the moonlight

3692
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:26,520
KRIS: Mmhmm.   AMY: Mmhmm. JERRY: outside.

3693
02:27:28,860 --> 02:27:30,319
JERRY: Maybe there's a new life for him.

3694
02:27:30,319 --> 02:27:31,639
KATE: (whispers) Oh my God.

3695
02:27:31,639 --> 02:27:32,519
KRIS: My man!

3696
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:35,720
JERRY: So, how are we dealing with this down here? KRIS: So exciting.

3697
02:27:35,719 --> 02:27:38,279
JERRY: You can hear the great clock...

3698
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:41,260
bong, down below.

3699
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:42,780
KATE: Yeah. That clock bong.

3700
02:27:42,780 --> 02:27:44,320
JERRY: It's that clock bong, nah'mean?

3701
02:27:44,319 --> 02:27:46,299
KATE: (laughs) KRIS: We can hear the clock bong.

3702
02:27:46,299 --> 02:27:47,399
KRIS: What sound does it make?

3703
02:27:47,399 --> 02:27:49,059
(laughter) JERRY: Shut up.

3704
02:27:49,059 --> 02:27:52,119
(laughter) JERRY: So...

3705
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:54,300
JERRY: How are you going to manage this stair issue?

3706
02:27:54,299 --> 02:27:55,619
AMY: Anybody got any illusions?

3707
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:57,040
KATE: I do! JERRY: There's some corpses...

3708
02:27:57,479 --> 02:27:59,059
RYAN: I loot the bodies!

3709
02:27:59,059 --> 02:28:00,819
KATE: Yes. Great. KRIS: Good idea.

3710
02:28:00,819 --> 02:28:02,779
KATE: Get all the toothpicks. RYAN: Yeah.

3711
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:05,340
KATE: What should I illuzshe? What are you thinking?

3712
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:09,780
AMY: Well I come running inside and I'm just like,

3713
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:11,440
"TREVOR!"

3714
02:28:12,420 --> 02:28:14,079
JERRY: (stammers) Are you looking for the wolf high five?

3715
02:28:14,079 --> 02:28:15,719
AMY: Oh yeah.

3716
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:17,340
JERRY: You take 20 damage.

3717
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:18,399
(laughter) JERRY: No.

3718
02:28:18,399 --> 02:28:19,579
RYAN: The high paw?

3719
02:28:19,940 --> 02:28:21,060
KRIS: The arm comes off.

3720
02:28:21,059 --> 02:28:23,239
JERRY: It's real, though. It happens.

3721
02:28:23,239 --> 02:28:24,760
AMY: It reverberates. JERRY: It's a lot.

3722
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:26,620
RYAN: I want to loot the main guy. JERRY: You set your feet.

3723
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:29,000
AMY: Let's loot real quick and then... RYAN: Yeah, I loot the main guy.

3724
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,059
KATE: Let's loot them all. AMY: let's hide.

3725
02:28:30,059 --> 02:28:31,699
RYAN: Everyone can loot their own -- KRIS: While you guys are looting...

3726
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:34,700
RYAN: Yeah. KRIS: I instruct Velvet to...

3727
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:39,079
KRIS: "Clean this up. Do your best. It's a lot to ask." KATE: Oh my God.

3728
02:28:39,079 --> 02:28:40,959
KATE: Sweet little Velvet. JERRY: So, so...

3729
02:28:40,959 --> 02:28:43,779
JERRY: Couple tugs...of the velvet,

3730
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:46,260
and then it's completely invisible.

3731
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:49,800
KRIS: Right. JERRY: And then it begins sweeping...

3732
02:28:49,799 --> 02:28:52,299
JERRY: the ichor and blood...

3733
02:28:52,299 --> 02:28:56,000
off of the increasingly dark red

3734
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,760
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: velvet.

3735
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:00,559
KRIS: It won't know. It's not the first time. JERRY: Yeah, exactly.

3736
02:29:00,559 --> 02:29:03,920
JERRY: (stammers) And then you can see just like the hand...

3737
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,239
Now the hand and the leg are being dragged down.

3738
02:29:07,239 --> 02:29:10,520
RYAN: We did this in front of, like...servants, right? JERRY: Yeah.

3739
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:12,079
RYAN: You knocked that glass pane. KRIS: Yeah.

3740
02:29:12,079 --> 02:29:13,440
RYAN: They watched this whole thing happen. JERRY: Yeah.

3741
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:15,460
AMY: They don't care. RYAN: So we like, "Hey! Little help?"

3742
02:29:15,459 --> 02:29:16,899
JERRY: With intense lethargy.

3743
02:29:16,899 --> 02:29:17,959
RYAN: Yeah.   KATE: How... JERRY: Now --

3744
02:29:17,959 --> 02:29:19,859
KATE: How happy would the vampires be if we did

3745
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:22,120
offer them these dead bodies, as like a yum yum?

3746
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:24,400
AMY: No, they like live. They need live ones. RYAN: Don't they need living? Yeah.

3747
02:29:24,399 --> 02:29:25,260
KATE: They're almost alive. KRIS: Yeah.

3748
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:26,280
RYAN: Haven't you ever seen Interview with the Vampire?

3749
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:28,659
JERRY: Yeah, I mean, with America's Tom Cruise. KATE: OK.

3750
02:29:28,659 --> 02:29:31,180
KRIS: It's a good thought.   KATE: Yeah. RYAN: Brad Pitt's greatest role!

3751
02:29:31,180 --> 02:29:32,620
KATE: I'm trying to be sweet. AMY: Louis du Pointe du Lac.

3752
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:33,920
RYAN: Aww sweet Louis.

3753
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:35,360
KATE: I'm trying to do nice things. JERRY: Alright, so...

3754
02:29:36,399 --> 02:29:38,239
JERRY: You keep track of stuff.

3755
02:29:38,239 --> 02:29:41,180
KRIS: Oh. Yes! Let me write these down now... RYAN: Oh yeah, what do I get out of that body?

3756
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:42,559
JERRY: Exactly.

3757
02:29:42,559 --> 02:29:45,760
Total from the three, there is:

3758
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:48,139
27 gold, KRIS: Mmhmm.   AMY: Take it.

3759
02:29:48,139 --> 02:29:50,159
JERRY: and two scrolls.

3760
02:29:50,159 --> 02:29:52,659
AMY: Two box of Omaha steaks. (laughs) RYAN: Ooo.

3761
02:29:52,659 --> 02:29:54,299
KRIS: Yeah, get those.

3762
02:29:54,299 --> 02:29:55,579
RYAN: Put those with the Percival wands

3763
02:29:55,579 --> 02:29:57,120
RYAN: that we never looked into. KATE: They're just a good deal.

3764
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:58,960
KRIS: Yeah. JERRY: You have them.

3765
02:29:58,959 --> 02:30:02,099
JERRY: Anytime you bring them up I can work them in. KRIS: Yeah. I tried to look at the crystal ball earlier.

3766
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:04,760
JERRY: Yeah. You've been trying to look at the crystal ball for fucking three weeks!

3767
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:05,800
KRIS: It's like a month! RYAN: I know.

3768
02:30:05,799 --> 02:30:07,939
JERRY: You can't do it. It's like a Rubik's Cube.

3769
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:10,200
KRIS: Somebody else can do an Arcana check on it. JERRY: Know what I mean?

3770
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:13,240
KATE: I got Arcana check.   KRIS: Yeah. RYAN: I don't have Arcana. History.

3771
02:30:13,239 --> 02:30:17,920
JERRY: So Velvet is continuing to manipulate these scenarios.

3772
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:20,139
You only have him for another half hour or so, but, KRIS: Yeah.

3773
02:30:20,139 --> 02:30:22,739
JERRY: should be enough time for him to do that kind of stuff.

3774
02:30:22,739 --> 02:30:27,199
You get up to the top of the stairs,

3775
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,500
that have you know...

3776
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:31,180
This part seems to be OK. KRIS: Hmm.

3777
02:30:31,180 --> 02:30:34,120
JERRY: You enter into the party.

3778
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:38,480
It seems like they're well in their cups of whatever it might be.

3779
02:30:38,479 --> 02:30:40,199
At this point...

3780
02:30:41,139 --> 02:30:45,219
the band is just finished it. You can hear a round of applause...

3781
02:30:45,219 --> 02:30:46,219
KRIS: Mmhmm.

3782
02:30:46,219 --> 02:30:47,859
JERRY: from the crowd.

3783
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:49,880
AMY: (quiet cheer) JERRY: The band says,

3784
02:30:49,879 --> 02:30:53,299
JERRY: "There is--when we do shows like this..."

3785
02:30:53,299 --> 02:30:55,799
"there's a song that we'd like to end on."

3786
02:30:56,459 --> 02:30:57,319
KRIS: Hmm!

3787
02:30:57,319 --> 02:30:59,719
JERRY: "We are Acquisitions Incorporated."

3788
02:30:59,719 --> 02:31:02,619
"DEATH to all vampires!"

3789
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:03,560
RYAN: Oh...

3790
02:31:03,559 --> 02:31:05,539
(bangs table) JERRY: That's this game.

3791
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:08,200
AMY: Come one! RYAN: (laughs)

3792
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:09,020
JERRY: It's true.

3793
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:11,280
KRIS: WHAT?!   KATE: That's the name of the song? AMY: Besmirch the name?

3794
02:31:11,739 --> 02:31:13,360
JERRY: That's true.

3795
02:31:13,360 --> 02:31:14,720
JERRY: That's what it's called. KATE: Aww that nuts.

3796
02:31:14,719 --> 02:31:16,000
KRIS: Maybe it's going to be a parody.

3797
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,399
JERRY: It could be like a Weird Al thing? RYAN &amp; KRIS: Yeah.

3798
02:31:19,399 --> 02:31:20,659
JERRY: Stream friends.

3799
02:31:20,659 --> 02:31:23,600
We will come back and hang out with you shortly.

3800
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:25,600
After we make use of the facilities.

3801
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:28,059
Come on back for Table Talk in just a couple of minutes.

3802
02:31:28,059 --> 02:31:31,279
Until then, enjoy some chiptunes.
