been playing Dungeons and Dragons for a

58
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:43,670
while now let's bring the channel which

59
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:46,939
is to say the shadow council to whom we

60
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:50,689
all report let's catch everybody back up

61
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:52,939
on your way back from the doone-gate in

62
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:57,709
obviously you made friends with young

63
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:58,879
Trevor mm-hmm currently not you don't

64
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,739
know exactly what's going on with him

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,169
right now but your suggestion was that

66
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:06,409
he take over operations at the

67
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:09,919
doone-gate in he went to his filthy cave

68
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:11,719
to his best rags ostensively to bring

69
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,969
them back up I'm not gonna get framed

70
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,830
for murder when he shows up dead bodies

71
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,750
a cop today not the way that I like to

72
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:22,219
think of it is that he is that he

73
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:24,949
operates a place where furries feel most

74
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:27,560
comfortable you know what I mean like as

75
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,780
a proprietor can you imagine that like I

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,819
also I never imagined it I bear the fur

77
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,799
fright 2012 so yes I could actually

78
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,469
imagine that first night there sure was

79
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:40,610
there I was like Trevor asked

80
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:41,329
that's right Revere you um on your way

81
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,720
back

82
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:48,700
obviously you set up a truly bizarre

83
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:51,319
murder mystery dinner scenario the

84
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:55,280
governor that this side of the table I

85
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:58,560
would say enjoyed a very high level on

86
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,680
your way back you left quickly

87
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,930
but on your way back Rosie B singer

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,060
suggested that you take their route

89
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:11,519
somewhat off the beaten path perhaps to

90
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:15,569
avoid the fuzz as you emerged into this

91
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,569
you got lost - he'll recall and we're

92
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:22,829
exposed to a truly bizarre phenomenon a

93
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:25,199
subterranean crypt unlike that which you

94
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:29,550
had seen indeed one that one that's

95
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,560
unique properties seems to raise

96
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,610
interest at the home office

97
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,930
you saw the or documentaries sheath

98
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,979
performing bizarre tricks of Otto

99
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,889
origami folding itself into birds flying

100
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,629
out you thought you saw some very

101
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:51,210
strange things it was also during this

102
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:54,629
time in the base of this chamber that

103
00:04:51,209 --> 00:05:01,649
your friend Chris trout became obsessed

104
00:04:54,629 --> 00:05:04,350
with a round dark gate that bore many

105
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:06,149
symbols of a round thing in life and in

106
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,470
deep wrong yeah yeah he was sprung but

107
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:10,379
he was he was like he was like a

108
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,370
mystical Express I got it and I loved it

109
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:16,860
yeah he was mythically sprung by this

110
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,379
eternal gate and the weird echo it

111
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:24,500
seemed to have of his focus a chunk of

112
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:29,699
black material stolen from the Underdark

113
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:36,529
upon escaping this zone you returned

114
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:43,259
home to find a skaaland Dragonborn

115
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:47,848
princess platinum tip-to-tail exquisite

116
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:53,759
armor brutal retinue they rolled into

117
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:55,949
the drawn and quarter and took eggy no

118
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,459
but as I believe that the euphemistic

119
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:01,409
term that we have leveraged the bar an

120
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,909
egg that you had invested quite a lot of

121
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,020
hit points in

122
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:09,630
um Bobby wait for it yeah and she was

123
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:12,269
meet I mean let's be honest she she

124
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:14,100
stole myself five she was me which was

125
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:15,149
probably the worst thing she did yeah

126
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,189
exactly

127
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:20,549
but they have still think about it but

128
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:26,250
they have and then on on the way out

129
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:29,790
after having succeeded rhetorically she

130
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,620
gives herself her own I five yeah what

131
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,980
does it mean what does it mean who would

132
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,680
do that

133
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,910
you guys look I owned a lot less episode

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,189
yeah yeah also didn't call out um teens

135
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,840
became aware yeah oh I really forgot

136
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,639
about that yeah how could happy with

137
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,079
what I was gonna say this is just be

138
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,329
there the left different as soon as you

139
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,189
want me to describe you're barred of

140
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:51,329
your affection well and I just want

141
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:53,579
everyone to remember how much of an

142
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:55,409
[ __ ] oak was oh okay [ __ ] worst

143
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,209
it's actually officially on I updated my

144
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,460
character sheet and it actually says I

145
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,620
saw it under enemies it says oak the

146
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,659
Ranger so I shown it was looking through

147
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,819
everybody wearing their chief I saw the

148
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,600
UN event notes like hell yeah I [ __ ]

149
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,459
got in there

150
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,500
yeah it's that oh yeah he put her okay

151
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:15,109
so it so to lift up Granger let's roll

152
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:20,990
back very quickly you also did encounter

153
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:24,439
team Bellerophon a crew of three

154
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:28,620
ostensibly aligned with acquisitions

155
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:30,719
incorporated in some way that has forced

156
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,280
sworn the use of a document sir they

157
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,710
feel like the paperwork just gets in the

158
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,899
way of their initiative and they also

159
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:40,109
claim to have some kind of a license

160
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:42,449
twelve our cars license that allows them

161
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,740
to step on local franchises and that's

162
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:50,159
basically what they did um but obviously

163
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,560
the he is the worst me I'm supposed to

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,020
be neutral I guess like I'm supposed to

165
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,209
simulate the universe and then you guys

166
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:00,539
react to it but I don't like him even

167
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:02,909
and I make him up to yourself in d-did

168
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:07,830
he via the clerical stuff that was in

169
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:12,180
their retinue currently unnamed some who

170
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:14,609
worships a God of currency what does

171
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,150
that say about them and then we also

172
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,550
have

173
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:23,620
the bard of that party whose war loot

174
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,879
found four targets with one pull of the

175
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:30,550
string you'll recall that the bolts were

176
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,370
hiding in plain sight and as hair pins I

177
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,509
don't know if you saw the fan art I did

178
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,940
yeah that was cool

179
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:38,889
I did it was legendary it was yeah I

180
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,560
think I was very very well pleased but

181
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:43,120
yes so that should be just about

182
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,189
everything it was a big episode there's

183
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,409
a lot a lot of stuff happened that time

184
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,480

00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:54,549
perhaps yes ok whispering hi

364
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:56,980
ok candy in it enough but yeah I mean

365
00:16:54,549 --> 00:17:01,240
there were eight total right but many of

366
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,889
them you know shifted and swayed okay

367
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,009
you think this is one you could

368
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,920
reproduce but you don't have any

369
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:10,019
of what it is they didn't like the other

370
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,269
one where you had to focus and then in

371
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,920
the presence of the gate you knew as

372
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:16,019
though you'd always known it but this is

373
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,850
this is not like that you can it's a

374
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:18,990
glyph it's without a condom but if you

375
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,909
know it does you don't know what it

376
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,529
signifies yeah okay

377
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,440
all you know is where it's you know

378
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:28,349
there is near something that's important

379
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,440
to you right okay I will then also

380
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:34,589
retire good idea

staff nice staff and master because you

384
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:43,109
told me that I had to take a long rest

385
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:45,750
with it I'm going to understand that I'm

386
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:47,759
looking at three short really a short

387
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,339
rep I would be one graph is be even

388
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,410
better yeah yeah yeah it's like I mean

389
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,119
that's that's yeah that's the longest

390
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,490
arrest if you have this kill yourself in

391
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,929
it yeah there you go to Union Building

392
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,210
now that you've had a long rest and you

393
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,940
load them into a crossbow which I have

394
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,380
now I have a hand Cross árboles yeah

395
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,029
yeah yeah oh yeah I grabbed a bunch of

396
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,590
crossbows but I planted them all around

397
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:12,629
there yeah absolutely so you are you are

398
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:14,129
spending time with neither that level of

399
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,590
what's better master sure sure so it's

400
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,260
your intention to to is really yes it's

401
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:21,389
six star I'm meditating on six start

402
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:27,750
thinking about her what her ascension to

403
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:36,170
master maybe then maybe you as you drift

404
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:42,720
off to sleep you find yourself in a

405
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:45,470
clearing in a bamboo forest there's a

406
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,350
cool breeze seems to be mid-afternoon

407
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:54,049
the harshest of the of the Sun is sort

408
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:59,819
of kept at bay by the waving stalks

409
00:18:54,049 --> 00:19:03,149
around you you stand there with the

410
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:07,169
staff of the master and you see before

411
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:09,750
you three stools and there is someone

412
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:13,800
seated on each of the three stools and

413
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,529
they each have the staff of the master

414
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,710
but each of them has a slightly

415
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:22,700
different version

416
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:26,450
so that the person on the far right has

417
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,360
three stripes as you know it the one in

418
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,789
the middle has two stripes and the one

419
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:35,079
on the left has a single stripe red

420
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:39,159
stripe and you can see you can see

421
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:44,109
children and adults sort of coming in

422
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:46,820
through forest paths to observe

423
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:49,009
something they see if they seem to know

424
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,349
why they're here okay today are they

425
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:54,289
aware of me or am I just absolutely do

426
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:58,059
you are you are standing where a student

427
00:19:54,289 --> 00:20:00,470
would okay in this configuration and

428
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:01,339
does my training allow me to understand

429
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,069
this configuration

430
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:07,490
oh yeah ritual that I know you have you

431
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:11,089
have almost certainly been in stools

432
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:14,870
like this teaching younger inherence of

433
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:16,639
the way of shadow okay so it seems like

434
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:19,609
I'm reliving someone else's experience

435
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,870
of taking the staff so I'm going to go

436
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:22,729
to emotions I'm just going to play along

437
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:24,799
I'm going to do do everything that I did

438
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,990
in my rituals and that I've seen however

439
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,210
many dozens of students do in theirs go

440
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,410
through go through the motions and just

441
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:39,250
kind of like see where this takes me

442
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:45,519
okay the person on the far right is a

443
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:53,240
halfling woman not quite at your August

444
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:56,869
age but not young and you can tell that

445
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:02,980
she is sort of vibrating in her seat and

446
00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:08,089
she doesn't have the calm patience of

447
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:11,599
her fellows on the stage that sits

448
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:15,609
before you and she throws herself to her

449
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:18,439
feet and stamps the staff of the master

450
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:22,029
against the wood planks of their

451
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:26,900
platform and the man in the center says

452
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:31,990
I would like to apologize for master

453
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,990
Albert she's only 300 years old

454
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:40,830
apology accepted

455
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:44,039
faster yeah seed at that accepting an

456
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:49,079
apology on behalf of someone else does

457
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:53,069
not Robert doesn't does not endear this

458
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:58,019
master mm-hmm to you and there's a jump

459
00:21:53,069 --> 00:22:03,629
off of the platform down immediately in

460
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:05,400
front of you and she says and you can

461
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,880
tell so on your onion you can even look

462
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:13,290
at your staff very quickly six star over

463
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,850
and rook and so you can guess out of

464
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:21,329
that how it goes okay and you're being

465
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:27,029
assessed like a fish at a market okay

466
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:29,369
and then just full examination idly

467
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:32,490
twirling the staff that you've just now

468
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:39,829
come in contact with and master rook

469
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:43,558
says do you think that your shadow path

470
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:49,409
can compare with the way of the open

471
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:52,950
fist I absolutely know it can but that's

472
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:56,730
not the point of the monk paths master

473
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:58,890
monk path exists for us all to better

474
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,960
the world to seek to better ourselves to

475
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,929
understand things not to compete with

476
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,130
each other master six are less like but

477
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:09,990
keeps it cool like a pain like this is

478
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,450
pure entertainment this is like their

479
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,859
television equivalent I think they're

480
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:21,660
having a super good time

481
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:27,259
some I what makes you think rosy bee

482
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,259
stinger that you can master this staff

483
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,519
to be perfectly honest I don't know

484
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:38,490
anything about this staff but what I do

485
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:42,779
know is that my dedication to the way of

486
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,029
the shadow is unquestionable I have been

487
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,180
studying this for

488
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:49,849
20 years of my life I've taught fellow

489
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,289
students I've researched I've been in

490
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:54,849
some of the finest libraries in the

491
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:57,920
world this is what I was born for

492
00:23:54,849 --> 00:24:00,769
there's no one better suited to take up

493
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,250
a staff like this than me roll

494
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:18,349
initiative

495
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:21,829
Oh nein nein the staff staff of the

496
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:24,019
master comes down huh and interests in a

497
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:27,019
split second you bring it up with one

498
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:30,920
hand just in an effort to glance the

499
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:32,720
blow-off right it comes in you get both

500
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,250
of your hands on the staff of the master

501
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,740
okay

502
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,480
you can you can tell already that you

503
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,900
know more about it than you did before

504
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,480
you know it's it's it's a it's supreme

505
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:48,350
craftsmanship but there's definitely

506
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,829
something else to it and as you moved it

507
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:58,279
up to block it it seemed to leave a

508
00:24:51,829 --> 00:25:00,710
trail almost through space and it's your

509
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,289
turn okay if you die in a dream you're

510
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:06,380
done in real life I know so that's true

511
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:08,119
so still in the first dream level though

512
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,090
okay Roger

513
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,829
I'm going to I'm going to if they're

514
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,809
doubting my devotion to the way the

515
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:21,289
shadow let's throw some [ __ ] shadow

516
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:25,849
at them I'm going to leave a singer I'm

517
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:28,009
going to whisper something crazy spooky

518
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:30,109
sounding and I'm going to cat hey Lee

519
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:32,660
yeah I'm gonna cast darkness on myself

520
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:35,809
if you want to see some shadow here's

521
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:38,150
some [ __ ] shadow for you dr.

522
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:41,750
dark yeah yeah

523
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,100
darkness so darkness is a 15 foot radius

524
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,039
mm-hmm

525
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:50,750
it is a

526
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:52,849
it can't be seen through even with dark

527
00:25:50,750 --> 00:26:00,169
vision non-magical light cannot be

528
00:25:52,849 --> 00:26:01,389
illuminate it mm-hmm not right so you

529
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:04,790
basically are just in the middle of this

530
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:07,790
horrible darkness but you're not able to

531
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:10,269
see opponents either crack cracks yeah

532
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:13,069

this response mhm and you can you can

539
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:41,389
sense and hear of the staff of the

540
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:44,569
master cutting through the marble orb

541
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:51,590
and it just comes off of you like an egg

542
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:53,119
it splits clean pass and fall apart now

00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:55,639
it's your turn okay welcome to dream

544
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,259
combat yeah this is pretty tight wait

545
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,900
okay so tell me there's a marble orb

546
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:01,910
around me I know basically the staff the

547
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,669
master comes down and sliced through the

548
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,558
darkness oh this is peeled away okay you

549
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:08,630
test the darkness yes literally attack

550
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,210
we are literally activate off on that C

551
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:15,490
team we literally attack the darkness

552
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:22,029
and it stays attacks yeah yeah okay okay

553
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:25,130
it's not the same um I'm going to use uh

554
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:27,079
hold on hold on hold on hold on I can

555
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,830
I'm going to do step of the wind mmm

556
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:33,319
which costs me a key points it does and

557
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:36,879
allows me to either disengage or - as

558
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:39,950
bonus action okay so in addition to

559
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,000
moving although I can't move because

560
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:46,190
we're in comments so I'm going to

561
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,619
disengage as a bonus action as I try to

562
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,960
pivot around in order to give myself

563
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:52,969
advantage on my next attack Oh to peel

564
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,569
around yeah yeah I like that yeah let me

565
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,220
see it

566
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:57,109
I'm down this didn't kind of rule you

567
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,548
want I want to see some acrobatics okay

568
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,750
oh yeah let's make let's make this look

569
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:03,470
right oh wait [ __ ]

570
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:07,039
you yeah that's real good so it splits

571
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:09,799
off the staff the master sweeping down

572
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:14,329
for you again but you perfectly pivot

573
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:19,839
and pirouette out of the side this the

574
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:24,079
staff is only one of master rooks

575
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:28,509
capabilities here in this context I am

576
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:31,639
wondering how you feel about if 14 AC

577
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:33,440
doesn't hit all right that is it Swift

578
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,720
sweeps right by you you can hear it sort

579
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,960
of whisper you can infect as you see it

580
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,220
come by you can see that at that speed I

581
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,250
mean it's almost like it's just

582
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,960
spreading through the air like it seems

583
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,680
two or three times as long as it should

584
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,750
a question do I have access to my

585
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:54,259
regular inventory or am i an inception

586
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,069
stream of guns yeah yeah so I have one

587
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:57,049
of the things that I have my inventory

588
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:59,299
is a check piece that is a rook and I

589
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:00,970
don't know if that is relevant it seems

590
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:04,009
like the kind of things that might be

591
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,370
yes yeah just like I've spin it and they

592
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:09,079
don't learn join oh yeah um is it do I

593
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:12,019
have access to the stuff in my in my

594
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:14,199
inventory right now reach for it I'm

595
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:19,279
gonna [ __ ] reach in there whip it out

596
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:21,769
and it's probably girl looks like an

597
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,250
idiot but whatever I'm 120 years old and

598
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:34,129
give a [ __ ] I'm like master rook does

599
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:36,950
this mean anything to you no I'm just

600
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,780
come on forget it you don't you can look

601
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,269
I just thought into it you have

602
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:43,250
advantage yeah and you're like that

603
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:45,650
that's why I have advantage I'm taking

604
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,390
mercy I'm asking yeah you can get behind

605
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:53,000
and Kalka crosses the ropes

606
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:54,440
in the most tradition is about avoiding

607
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,900
combat where possible yeah this is

608
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,400
awesome so I have the advantage I could

609
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,410
stick my core stuff right up his butt

610
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,950
but I'm I'm gonna ask you a question a

611
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,380
little bit

612
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:07,910
story-wise it's awesome thank you thanks

613
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:11,270
very much he's it's like a imagine like

614
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:13,519
a tea ball type situation just

615
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:19,490
sweeps the staff straight across the

616
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:22,639
brook and goes my rook that's rude yeah

617
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,440
yeah alright fine so I try it

618
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,530
goodbye rook on the cross that off yeah

619
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,350
just very good dream yes dream on yeah

620
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:32,029
right dream work and then cos she's like

621
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:35,059
sorry I've got three good berries

622
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:36,829
oh well you've got a jar idols crab dad

623
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:40,759
open see what happened dream bigger yeah

624
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:43,279
you like a beluga whale and he's got

625
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:46,359
work for this so he's gonna he's gonna

626
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:50,470
swing on you I guess though he is uh-uh

627
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:54,139
no it's on a single foot he leans back

628
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:57,890
and then pokes out with the rod but he

629
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:02,390
is not able to do anything with an ACO 7

630
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:06,080
ok great so again I do feel like this is

631
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:08,420
some kind of my brain is feeling that

632
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,899
this is a trial so I'm just using all of

633
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:13,400
my [ __ ] way of shadow moves I'm using

634
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,980
next is going to be patient defense

635
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:20,930
which means that all tax against we have

636
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:23,000
disadvantage I mean and I will and

637
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:26,150
that's another key point right it is and

638
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,039
I'm going to continue to I'm going to

639
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,320
try to strike to disarm him I don't have

640
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,539
disarming strike but I do kind of want

641
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:39,409
to strike at his hand more than to cause

642
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:43,789
harm to his oh yes I do that that'll

643
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:46,610
India 16 good and you'll get there tip

644
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:48,589
that is the that is the hand a cease

645
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:53,089
yeah yeah little thingies break them off

646
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:55,659
to snap them yeah give me some things

647
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:58,819
can just roll the damage so that I know

648
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:04,400
move that's a lot of damage that's of

649
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:07,279
damage I'm 17 I was like yeah I roll out

650
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,610
that still has damage 12 no that's mine

651
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:14,000
don't touch it all 12 fingers are broken

652
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:19,250
so you see strike the hand I'll blow and

653
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,009
V the stab you see the staff like he

654
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:24,829
loses grip on it and it flies you know

655
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:25,250
up a couple feet and then while it is in

656
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:30,308
the

657
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:33,919
he takes this opportunity to unload

658
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:35,298
Martley strikes how I say bow I have

659
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,929
commit to flex missile and grab the

660
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:40,220
stuff I think that that is described I

661
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:45,130
think that the flick missiles is used

662
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:50,960
nice visit Pat no is me I never know

663
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:53,419
your forever the you know yes the the

664
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,450
staff is was not a directed at you as

665
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:57,740
right away I attended but now I think I

666
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:05,409
finally have something going here

667
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:10,220
so an AC of 17 battled hit okay now

668
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:14,059
three points of damage and I need you to

669
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:18,470
succeed on a DC 13 dexterity saving

670
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:21,700
through AIA 17 absolutely but you can

671
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:25,130
you can tell that a person without your

672
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,259
training on that craggy Peaks would be

673
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:30,080
flat on the ground as a result of this

674
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:31,490
strike and indeed master Brook seems a

675
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,168
little surprised that that was not the

676
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,779
result there may be something to this

677
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:38,538
shadow passing you know what I mean it's

678
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:39,109
tight as hell yeah I say I told you it's

679
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:41,359
tight

680
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:42,589
all right here so while the staff is

681
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:47,058
still in the air let's see what you got

682
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:49,970
okay I want to leap up and grab it yeah

683
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:52,849
your double stuff [ __ ] yes I am alright

684
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:55,250
have you met me yeah actually here let's

685
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:59,709
try some doesn't be a good acrobatic

686
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:02,569
snatch and then he called me in college

687
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:06,110
that's 11 I got it okay looking for 10

688
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:10,460
okay um so you now you have both staves

689
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:12,829
yeah do with her neck you hold one in

690
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,250
your mouth high like one piece of player

691
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:21,769
as you grab the other staff and set it

692
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:28,869
down you feel a spray on your face and

693
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:32,570
in a moment you are on a swaying bridge

694
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:37,920
in front of a rushing waterfall with a

695
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:43,590
full moon hung in the sky this ripe

696
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:44,519
okay Wow to the Moray all right I didn't

regularly yeah it's not super hard okay

702
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:12,090
you can see master rook okay walking out

703
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:13,169
along the bridge toward you okay I'm not

704
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:17,250
going to take any kind of aggressive

705
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:19,170
stance against him no you get on that

706
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,030
one yes or cut off the bread here on the

707
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,860
strike you have to pull out this vine

708
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,480
yeah that's the only way that's not

709
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,440
gonna and that's how long before only

at him across the the din of the

713
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,480
waterfall this it doesn't have to be

714
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:44,579

peacefully and in fact enhance one

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,100
understand why the trial by combat is

722
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:07,259
necessary of course but remind me

723
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:09,989
refresh me on it obviously but do you

724
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:15,990
know for sure for the sake of X to the

725
00:36:09,989 --> 00:36:21,689
gene-specific you love it you have an

726
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:27,179
artifact you have evidence of our paths

727
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:32,789
ancient wisdom it belongs inside our

728
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:37,879
traditions no one else can have it I had

729
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:40,679
to be tested and how did I do

730
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,150
we'll see oh it's not over okay

731
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:44,149
he holds his hand out for his staff I

732
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:53,190
toss it

733
00:36:46,150 --> 00:37:02,980
right off the birds the moon [ __ ]

734
00:36:53,190 --> 00:37:04,690
duck in the moon like I'll never get an

735
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:10,690
idea it's like Waco

736
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:14,528
yeah there's no passing for that he he

737
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:20,170
says like this and adopts of stance that

738
00:37:14,528 --> 00:37:23,639
you know practice stance with the staff

739
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:28,778
and sort of beckons you to respond okay

740
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:32,940
so you see him enter a practice kata and

741
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:36,518
then the deeper he gets into it it the

742
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:39,970
staff is like a rotor like it ceases to

743
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:44,739
be it ceases to be visible as much as

744
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:46,868
coherent stick right um and no more

745
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:51,998
prequel references y'all so exactly now

746
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:57,220
it's nasty um and he says he says trust

747
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:59,009
me so he brings that he brings it into

748
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:01,899
contact with you you don't feel pain

749
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:03,909
it's almost like a it's almost like

750
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:08,769
you're observing it as a third party hmm

751
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:11,618
you can see what it represents and when

752
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:20,318
it is in this state when the staff is in

753
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:22,778
this state it's almost hypnotic and when

754
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:27,969
it comes into contact with you he enters

755
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:31,768
into a sequence of punches a sequence of

756
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:36,998
martial blows that have an intensity

757
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:39,399
that you want okay this you want it like

758
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:41,199
you see it if you saw it on the shelf

759
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,789
give me the punches if you sit on the

760
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:49,149
shelf and so and so he connects two

761
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:50,589
times and then goes back and then you

762
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,660
can tell that this is the this is the

763
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:54,828
this is the student stance and he has

764
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:56,899
allowed you to enter the master stance

765
00:38:54,829 --> 00:39:01,539
so come after yes I'm gonna do it

766
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:04,759
everything he just did right Meerut Jack

767
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:09,130
hmm wait I have lucky I'm lucky your

768
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:14,539
love is a lie rural a natural one who

769
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:16,358
that's 15 seconds okay in this because

770
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:20,119
we're he's not really trying to get you

771
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:23,659
so as you as you lash out it's almost

772
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:28,400
like a whip like how flexible this this

773
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:32,989
rod is Ennis after you connect here

774
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,889
after any punch attack that you do is a

775
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:38,179
d8 instead of a d6 that's the best

776
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:40,998
education I think that's in addition to

777
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:43,818
the +1 attack +1 damage oh my god so

778
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:45,889
just I'm not going to I'm going to say

779
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:48,889
d8 it sounds great but it was one d4

780
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:50,478
before so now now it's really it's

781
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:52,308

905
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:11,719
endure me and I would be destroyed

906

my in my face to my chosen patron and it

959
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:32,390

960
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:36,590
Ullman drawn to recover the soul of one

961
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:40,670

970
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,769
no other option have I told you that I

977
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:34,360
lot about what the Goblin told us oh

978
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:38,030
forgotten oh yeah pennies ago which

979
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:41,510
aligns with your current attitude even a

980
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:45,320
stopped goblin is correct twice a day

981
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:48,740
later today yeah wow that is here's our

982
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:52,970

the day after go so yeah I'm I'm really

984
00:49:52,969 --> 00:50:01,129
distrustful and I will I will share with

985
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,750
the party what

986
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,289
was given to me what I found on my

987
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:08,298
person that first day in the alley and

988
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:10,819
outside of the drona and courtier is a

989
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:14,358
note apparently in my own hand that I

990
00:50:10,818 --> 00:50:19,268
wrote myself that reads I cannot

991
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:21,469
I must not I will not what

992
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:26,209
and this coin

993
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:27,818
someone threw at me behind your ear what

994
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:30,259
could that mean

995
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:32,719
right now I'm interpreting it to me

996
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:35,809
trust this man again

997
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:38,328
and we are going to be fed to this to

998
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:40,220
this creature it's you're my only my

999
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:44,170
only interest here is that it seems to

1000
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:47,629
be bound up with with my chosen faith

1001
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,250
you know but other than that no could

1002
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,980
have been a lot more useful if you just

1003
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:56,778

00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:58,759

Yeah right there so my allergies there's

1011
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:19,038

1019
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,699
point

1020
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:50,380
I'm a straight shooter it's true you

1022
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:57,890
ducked at a kid and then lost it I marry

1024
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:06,460
so clear I meant yeah everything I love

1026
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:14,900
I mean we also found an entire cart that

1027
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:16,519
was a potentially personal dark magic

1028
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,079
we'll fill the personal dark magic wand

1029
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:21,409
that's right we haven't really talked

1030
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:24,319

00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:58,430
although now i calls everything into

1045
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:00,800
question because who is the shadiest

1049
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:12,400
yeah yeah yeah I don't know Christian

1051
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,990
and then at one was like kind of like

1052
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:20,210
look she's like well I'm so are when the

1053
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:22,759
documents I was writing could see us and

1054
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:24,590
where we were when we were in the room

1055
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,600
actually I didn't explain that to anyone

1056
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,550
and then I go well here's the thing when

1057
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:29,630
I was filling out one of my forms and

1058
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,160
it's very technical and even really

1059
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:33,200
understand it but it started writing

1060
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:36,469
back to me instructions that we should

1061
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,609
leave the room that we were in and so

1062
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:39,109

1063
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,860

01:03:01,108 --> 01:03:05,069
and then he just was chicken only did he

1255
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,920
say spread out on the floor omen turned

1256
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:08,490
into the chicken that's actually

1257
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,889
possible

1258
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:13,169
we saw omen he was in our room upstairs

1259
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:14,489
an illusion of him and then suddenly

1260
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:17,070
they were check yes something happened

1261
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:17,818
and then they were chickens yes and she

1262
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:24,559
says

1263
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:29,159
he has a wizard friend hmm

1264
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:31,670
the less the less spoken of about him

1265
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:34,578
the better he's responsible for this

1266
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:37,229
trick they played on my door

1267
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:41,068
yes well familiar with that trick yeah I

1268
01:03:37,228 --> 01:03:42,929
I told them very specifically that that

1269
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:43,858
was not an acceptable usage of the

1270
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:47,728
drowning courtier

1271
01:03:43,858 --> 01:03:49,588
well it certainly gave us the wrong

1272
01:03:47,728 --> 01:03:52,528
impression of the establishment at first

1273
01:03:49,588 --> 01:03:54,679
yeah it's been a problem in the past and

1274
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:58,170
now look what he's done to your actual

1275
01:03:54,679 --> 01:04:01,768
establishment um she she she shakes her

1276
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:06,180
head because it holds open the door so

1277
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:08,939
what's up makes a sound in her throat

1278
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:15,929
mm-hmm can we get that something yeah

1279
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:20,130
sure hmm and chickens um like a moth to

1280
01:04:15,929 --> 01:04:21,958
flame on her mouth all right now no make

1281
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:23,910
it my favorite is a highway to the

1282
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:26,698
danger zone goodbye Kenny Loggins and

1283
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:28,288
like it just right in the mouth yeah but

1284
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:31,048
if any one of them just jumps and flaps

1285
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:33,839
once yeah into the mouth it just happens

1286
01:04:31,048 --> 01:04:35,728
for 15 minutes no no that arising none

1287
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:39,630
of that happens this is the bore episode

1288
01:04:35,728 --> 01:04:42,419
oh they're they're running out there's

1289
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:45,959
like just one there's one extra one oh

1290
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:49,349
that has found a place beneath the table

1291
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:51,989
that it seems to like but onyx appears

1292
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:54,568
at the head of the stairs and begins to

1293
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:58,499
step down the stairs and while I go back

1294
01:04:54,568 --> 01:05:03,719
I said one what are you growing chickens

1295
01:04:58,498 --> 01:05:06,629
now yeah they go I know it's a principle

1296
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:10,858
of the deal the art of three chickens

1297
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:12,650
yes look I don't care about chicken I

1298
01:05:10,858 --> 01:05:14,969
want score rhetorical point yes

1299
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:16,528
absolutely so that's that's the sir

1300
01:05:14,969 --> 01:05:18,719
that's the scene is it is willing to

1301
01:05:16,528 --> 01:05:21,420
abide by the terms of this agreement if

1302
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,909
only because it thinks that being around

1303
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:25,619
you will almost certainly result in

1304
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:28,708
additional birds well now it knows what

1305
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:30,420
I can do yes you can active on the bird

1306
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:32,250
this big it at any

1307
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:36,750
yeah I just whispered think about what I

1308
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:39,780
could do with my yes gross yeah

1309
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:42,690
kiddie pool are those a thousand mice in

1310
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,339
your pocket here's everything I think

1311
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:47,789
that I think onyx would be happy to see

1312
01:05:44,338 --> 01:05:50,489
you um so so in the situation so she

1313
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:52,380
says is there anything else upstairs

1314
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:56,219
that I need to know about the wandering

1315
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:57,990
crypt yeah so we were done uh she she

1316
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:00,328
shakes her head like that makes you can

1317
01:05:57,989 --> 01:06:03,529
see her jaw set in her mouth

1318
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:11,849
as soon as as soon as you mentioned this

1319
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:16,619
crypt what do you know about it this is

1320
01:06:11,849 --> 01:06:20,880
a story all about how my life lovely I

1321
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:28,890
got I'm just living that I have been

1322
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:33,269
made to endure at great pain virtually

1323
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:38,848
all of omens life and I want to

1324
01:06:33,269 --> 01:06:42,619
apologize as his mother that he has

1325
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:42,619
gotten you wrapped up in this now too

1326
01:06:43,489 --> 01:06:49,729

through no fault of her own I'm ready

1344
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:16,550
a student of my wife got bungled up in

1345
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:16,550

usually they have usually they have for

1350
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:37,619
when they're posted here but I never met

1351
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:39,920
the fourth hmm and they were here for

1352
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:39,920
years

1353
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:51,990
pudding never finding what almond said

1354
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:55,829
them to find until eventually they were

1355
01:08:51,989 --> 01:08:59,309
moved on to other tasks near manage that

1356
01:08:55,829 --> 01:09:07,859
they never found it and he could not

1357
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:09,740
accept it he could not accept that this

1358
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:13,889
script was not real

1359
01:09:09,739 --> 01:09:17,969
last night we practically tripped into

1360
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:22,250
one of its premiere mouths do you

1361
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:29,820
another list do you know how many crits

1362
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:36,420
there are on Toro yes 10 have a good you

1363
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:39,659
entered a crypt you did not find did he

1364
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:43,260
tell you why he wants you to find the

1365
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:48,599
wandering crypt no only that we were to

1366
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:56,079
prepare immediately to do so when omen

1367
01:09:48,600 --> 01:10:01,490
was very young his sister auspicious

1368
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:10,279
entered a crypt like this and never

1369
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:14,840
returned he could never make peace with

1370
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:18,039
it and he has spent his life trying to

1371
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,449
find something that doesn't exist

1372
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:23,479
because he can't accept what I've

1373
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:29,840
accepted which is that auspicious is

1374
01:10:23,479 --> 01:10:36,979
dead a real fox mulder vibe to it hmm

1375
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:47,630
I want to believe first you have some

1376
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:50,929
somewhere and I'm seeking is what we

1377
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:57,440
happen upon in where we were last night

1378
01:10:50,930 --> 01:11:00,260
I don't know why that would trigger omen

1379
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:03,639
to send a message to us now but I'm

1380
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:08,030
assuming that we got closer than

1381
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:14,750
Bellerophon did you need to be very

1382
01:11:08,029 --> 01:11:18,500
careful the place he is asking you to

1383
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:21,159
find is not real but that doesn't mean

1384
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:23,649
that you aren't an incredible danger

1385
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:26,329
trying to make this happen

1386
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:29,329
there's going to come a point where your

1387
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:32,420
lives are on the line for this thing

1388
01:11:29,329 --> 01:11:34,909
he's chosen to believe and that will be

1389
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:36,699
a very important point of decision for

1390
01:11:34,909 --> 01:11:40,579
you

1391
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:42,439
now wait the thing you are looking for

1392
01:11:40,579 --> 01:11:46,010
the thing that you have been searching

1393
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:49,279
for just happened to appear in a crypt

1394
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:50,989
we like stumbled into doesn't that

1395
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:53,380
strike you as odd well the crypt emerge

1396
01:11:50,989 --> 01:11:57,469
from the ground when I was running along

1397
01:11:53,380 --> 01:12:00,640
next to you right it erupted from the

1398
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:04,579
earth right but what was it odd that

1399
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:09,320
this secret crypt

1400
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:11,720
right next to town where omen probably

1401
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:14,059
has lived for some time hmm just like

1402
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:17,869
exploded out and had the exact thing

1403
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:22,130
that Catrice was looking for well didn't

1404
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:26,720
they drop you off here for a reason I'm

1405
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:28,340
assuming yeah write letters to yourself

1406
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:31,789
maybe this thing has a taste for

1407
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:33,140
drawings no maybe I'm just saying it's

1408
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:35,479
possible that this creature is able to

1409
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:37,310
manifest our deepest desires the things

1410
01:12:35,479 --> 01:12:40,699
that we're looking for the most in order

1411
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:46,670
to lure us deeper into it go it is if

1412
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:50,659
it's real it's real really not it seemed

1413
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:56,180
very real lesson it is in as much as our

1414
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:58,909
as our as our work here coincides with

1415
01:12:56,180 --> 01:13:02,740
the same time seeking hmm I have no

1416
01:12:58,909 --> 01:13:05,569
reason not to follow but that's what I'm

1417
01:13:02,739 --> 01:13:08,210
doing before we do anything resembling

1418
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:11,299
going back in that crypt I need to put

1419
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:13,939
some [ __ ] protection up on your crazy

1420
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,449
ass because we could you almost got us

1421
01:13:13,939 --> 01:13:15,919
all killed

1422
01:13:14,449 --> 01:13:18,260
we're not going back in there until I

1423
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,210
know that your God is not going to make

1424
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,070
you insane again or we could just all

1425
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:24,170
get in writing that if this happens

1426
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:27,340
again that we just really didn't leave

1427
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:31,130
em in there and I think that we're all

1428
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:33,230
Baconator yeah yeah I Jenni was gonna do

1429
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:35,539
it yeah when we were in the crypt itself

1430
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:41,559
sure like do you want to be on a team

1431
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:43,970
with us I can use a lot I need to be

1432
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:47,390
because I don't want that's why I had

1433
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:49,869
last night to happen yes I would rather

1434
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:54,619
that we had established some sort of a

1435
01:13:49,869 --> 01:13:57,529
kill switch urn and I usually whatever

1436
01:13:54,619 --> 01:13:59,659
the in world equivalent of kill switches

1437
01:13:57,529 --> 01:14:01,189
no is of the a team when they had used

1438
01:13:59,659 --> 01:14:03,050
to give me a block as a blessing milk

1439
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:06,129
for you on a plane because he was scared

1440
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:09,190
to fly yeah we needed that device for me

1441
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:11,900
yeah so that has a bit of trouble

1442
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:14,659
because you can cannot give a hook to

1443
01:14:11,899 --> 01:14:16,670
Miss Lee so we can - yeah carry you

1444
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:18,229

1452
01:14:32,029 --> 01:14:36,590
able to shut him down at any moment if

knowledge of stuff and my background I

1728
01:27:41,408 --> 01:27:44,288

find information on something if it's a

1730
01:27:44,288 --> 01:27:48,908

that's a 23 yeah I totally get it I'm

1749
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:44,438
straight up your knowledge transcends

1750
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:46,179
space and time yeah I wrote several

1751
01:28:44,439 --> 01:28:48,309
books about the laundry of Chris yeah

1752
01:28:46,179 --> 01:28:50,949
exactly that's my crib no not your

1753
01:28:48,309 --> 01:28:52,989
[ __ ] you know in high school your

1754
01:28:50,948 --> 01:29:01,928
nickname is rose Eastern yellow on

1755
01:28:52,988 --> 01:29:02,618
during a crypt B singer oh my god just

1756
01:29:01,929 --> 01:29:06,729
joking

1757
01:29:02,618 --> 01:29:11,759
together digital yeah yeah Chad smash it

1758
01:29:06,729 --> 01:29:16,418
I wrote when T [ __ ] you on the back oh

1759
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:18,909
no there are all kinds of I mean it's

1760
01:29:16,418 --> 01:29:22,118
like if it's like a crypto archeology

1761
01:29:18,908 --> 01:29:31,628
thing right you can go back and you know

1762
01:29:22,118 --> 01:29:33,578
of all kinds of of calamities that could

1763
01:29:31,628 --> 01:29:37,779
oh the calamities that don't have any

1764
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:40,748
real answer that you could apply stories

1765
01:29:37,779 --> 01:29:42,099
to like you you feel like what you have

1766
01:29:40,748 --> 01:29:44,139
been told now obviously there's a

1767
01:29:42,099 --> 01:29:47,199
difference of opinion between

1768
01:29:44,139 --> 01:29:49,650
prophetess and omen about what it

1769
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:55,059
represents and what actually happened

1770
01:29:49,649 --> 01:29:57,579
but there is and there is a good

1771
01:29:55,060 --> 01:30:00,880
argument to be made that there is

1772
01:29:57,579 --> 01:30:05,198
something that connects disappearances

1773
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:09,250
of towns individuals you know the

1774
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:12,000
tectonic activity like you can see that

1775
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:16,270
there's the the history of this valley

1776
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:19,149
has things that could that could be a

1777
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:22,690
part of a single story like you can you

1778
01:30:19,149 --> 01:30:24,629
can sort of see these these tales these

1779
01:30:22,689 --> 01:30:27,789
sort of like half understood tales

1780
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:31,900
coalescing around a possible plausible

1781
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:34,090
line of causality okay it doesn't you're

1782
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:36,939

few small sketches some particular trees

1878
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:14,680

1879
01:35:13,238 --> 01:35:18,189
special note that wouldn't have been

1880
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:20,710

2135
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:55,918
never had a master Oh dark in my way but

2136
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:58,498
but no I mean so there's all this

2137
01:46:55,918 --> 01:47:01,139
basically as your what is the tentacle

2138
01:46:58,498 --> 01:47:05,188
smell like well good question fresh-cut

2139
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:07,979
garden hose it's like plastic yeah

2140
01:47:05,189 --> 01:47:10,050
garden I like a grass you a little bit

2141
01:47:07,979 --> 01:47:12,510
vamps because I want a real answer

2142
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:17,069
it smells like from your from your

2143
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:19,280
Wiesel Ian's consciousness yes it smells

2144
01:47:17,069 --> 01:47:23,460
like a sword smells

2145
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:25,679
dancing and so okay baby you tonight

2146
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:27,960
we're just cataloging all these things

2147
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:31,409
in your mind you're sort of you're sort

2148
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:32,670
of running down the list like what order

2149
01:47:31,409 --> 01:47:34,469
you're going to eat him in it's like

2150
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:36,719
okay I'm going to go for the I'm going

2151
01:47:34,469 --> 01:47:38,640
to go for the millipede then I'm going

2152
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:40,880
to have the worms than you would of

2153
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:44,520
course and then there's this other

2154
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:51,150
there's this other smell oh it's a

2155
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:55,469
brackish old water smell that is deeply

2156
01:47:51,149 --> 01:47:57,779
offensive to the nose oh so I look at

2157
01:47:55,469 --> 01:48:00,930
the snake so that could this can see

2158
01:47:57,779 --> 01:48:02,939
that I'm like I'm not little fur I get

2159
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:04,710
brush tail yellow yeah there's no defile

2160
01:48:02,939 --> 01:48:06,719
is something and I ranch

2161
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:08,039
I guess I do my best impression of a

2162
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:11,670
weasel trying to point at something I'm

2163
01:48:08,039 --> 01:48:15,439
like yeah so you can you can see it as

2164
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:19,199
well so just talk to me because I'm here

2165
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:21,179
sometimes I just get some time going to

2166
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:26,159
get a little overwhelmed by my animal

2167
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:30,050
senses and I want to confess I just want

2168
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:34,019
to continue down the path which to you

2169
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:36,150
so you are moving farther and farther

2170
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:39,300
down and you can sort of get a sense

2171
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:42,889
that this is where the chamber was

2172
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:47,610
before and where that chamber was is now

2173
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:50,130
large sort of chewed out stone more or

2174
01:48:47,609 --> 01:48:52,380
less the same volume but you can see

2175
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:57,090
that where you went down that initial

2176
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:59,730
stair now this rough hewn stone that's

2177
01:48:57,090 --> 01:49:02,190
happening again except it's a much wider

2178
01:48:59,729 --> 01:49:06,359
area mm-hmm so it's almost as though

2179
01:49:02,189 --> 01:49:09,869
that part of the chamber hmm just ground

2180
01:49:06,359 --> 01:49:15,389
itself down through the earth and what's

2181
01:49:09,869 --> 01:49:17,640
more you're starting to see those

2182
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:22,530
scratches have become something more

2183
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:25,950
like a pattern so inside the inside

2184
01:49:22,529 --> 01:49:29,809
these scrapes you notice it

2185
01:49:25,949 --> 01:49:29,809
instantaneously and in fact you're

2186
01:49:30,289 --> 01:49:35,579
you're familiar

2187
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:39,510
uh you can just feel it sort of coiling

2188
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:41,460
and turning with delight I need an hour

2189
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:42,510
can I check from you like sugar love to

2190
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:47,270
do that for you

2191
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:53,789
rollin that boy whipping boy not exact

2192
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:56,010
that's a real well yeah go to one you

2193
01:49:53,789 --> 01:49:57,569
with a super one that so as I say so it

2194
01:49:56,010 --> 01:50:01,010
sort of Turtles it turns itself into

2195
01:49:57,569 --> 01:50:04,920
almost like a corkscrew and it's just

2196
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:06,659
flopping like flopping itself against

2197
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:10,980
the stone and you can see it sort of

2198
01:50:06,659 --> 01:50:13,649
drawn over toward symbols that are

2199
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:16,259
increasing in definition so I think it

2200
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:19,229
looks more natural and more raw than the

2201
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:24,750
farther down you get into this you can

2202
01:50:19,229 --> 01:50:28,769
see that it's it's um almost like the

2203
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:30,899
surface has been melted into glass mm-hm

2204
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:32,910
you can see that these these scrapes are

2205
01:50:30,899 --> 01:50:35,909
becoming more and more coherent symbols

2206
01:50:32,909 --> 01:50:38,279
and you can tell through the connection

2207
01:50:35,909 --> 01:50:40,710
that these symbols are the symbols of

2208
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:44,599
the gate you can see the symbol of the

2209
01:50:40,710 --> 01:50:48,949
earth and what's more you can see it

2210
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:51,990
rising against another symbol and it

2211
01:50:48,949 --> 01:50:56,269
tries to eat it oh it's actually trying

2212
01:50:51,989 --> 01:51:00,539
to nasha it goes over gnaws at the

2213
01:50:56,270 --> 01:51:05,040
symbol pull it all on a second don't

2214
01:51:00,539 --> 01:51:08,550
look at it we're fit some needed I'm

2215
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:10,050
sorry yeah you can get here you don't

2216
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:12,150
know if it's because you're not there

2217
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:13,680
physically or if it's something to do

2218
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:16,439
with the link you have it's familiar

2219
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:18,329
it's very hard to make it it's very hard

2220
01:51:16,439 --> 01:51:20,509
to make it out you recognize occur like

2221
01:51:18,329 --> 01:51:22,439
through its yeah you recognize the ER

2222
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:25,289
instantaneously like the rest of it is

2223
01:51:22,439 --> 01:51:27,119
difficult yes yes so as I said like

2224
01:51:25,289 --> 01:51:29,579
stand alone complex yes like it's got

2225
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:31,170
its faces like the circle on it and so

2226
01:51:29,579 --> 01:51:32,989
what it pulls this weave as I say it

2227
01:51:31,170 --> 01:51:39,779
pulls down it's sort of creating this

2228
01:51:32,989 --> 01:51:41,939
giant glass stair that descends down

2229
01:51:39,779 --> 01:51:45,539
into it but there's there's no there's

2230
01:51:41,939 --> 01:51:47,639
no whatever that was is not here

2231
01:51:45,539 --> 01:51:49,439
this is something else roads indeed and

2232
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:51,960
you can see that those symbols continue

2233
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:53,759
to increase in definition they get

2234
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:58,739
sharper and sharper the farther in you

2235
01:51:53,760 --> 01:52:01,829
go hmm all right I am feel like this is

2236
01:51:58,739 --> 01:52:04,889
as far away as I want to as I want to

2237
01:52:01,829 --> 01:52:07,890
get so hope thing but what's the weird

2238
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:14,070
sneaking it I have a glass yeah really

2239
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:16,230
uh so it's getting a little crazy down

2240
01:52:14,069 --> 01:52:17,759
here do we want to all go down here do

2241
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:20,459
we want to like relay this to the group

2242
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,720
what do you think oh yeah let's let's

2243
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:23,789
tell the good can you see these symbols

2244
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:28,079
I can't like my it's not they're not

2245
01:52:23,789 --> 01:52:31,769
resolving for me yeah one looks like a

2246
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:33,750
one dumb squiggle and then another even

2247
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:37,440
dumber squiggle and they look like

2248
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:39,029
nothing oh my god squiggles great this

2249
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:42,960
is my special quick those are special

2250
01:52:39,029 --> 01:52:45,449
squiggle for me you yelled at like do we

2251
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:49,050
hear it oh my god squiggles yeah and I'm

2252
01:52:45,449 --> 01:52:51,510
like I'm like I've got eagle eyes on you

2253
01:52:49,050 --> 01:52:53,970
I know I'm just like hovering behind

2254
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:54,930
your neck like that variable Phi yeah

2255
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:56,789
yeah

2256
01:52:54,930 --> 01:52:59,159
we will decapitate you yeah that crazy

2257
01:52:56,789 --> 01:53:01,019
please angry yeah yeah I know none of

2258
01:52:59,159 --> 01:53:03,449
these spaces look like they could think

2259
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:06,470
that a person could go down them so

2260
01:53:03,449 --> 01:53:09,210
something scraped these out and then

2261
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:10,860
descended down yeah exactly sort of

2262
01:53:09,210 --> 01:53:13,920
pulled it looks get sort of like pulled

2263
01:53:10,859 --> 01:53:18,119
its way down and in its descent it's

2264
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:19,949
left this bizarre language right what

2265
01:53:18,119 --> 01:53:22,229
you're super heated the edge of the

2266
01:53:19,949 --> 01:53:24,479
rocker something is if something has

2267
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:25,979
happened to the stone is it big enough

2268
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:28,339
that the group could get there

2269
01:53:25,979 --> 01:53:32,039
absolutely no but I say this is a

2270
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:35,579
grandparent Italica the grand old alike

2271
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:38,550
this is orc [ __ ] like it ah you're going

2272
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:43,710
down your territory alright yeah so I

2273
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:46,170
want to get so can I get the listen up

can you come in there hey guys with a

2276
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,890
little more hesitancy than I want well

2277
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:54,569
yeah yeah ultimately it gives up

2278
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:56,430
ultimately it gives up I didn't know how

2279
01:53:54,569 --> 01:53:58,359
to do and then starts to flop around you

2280
01:53:56,430 --> 01:54:02,619
might bite him and bring it

2281
01:53:58,359 --> 01:54:04,630
all yeah I want to do that ah I wait

2282
01:54:02,618 --> 01:54:07,359
telling exchange sighs too late about

2283
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:10,000
you know I bet I thought I'd do a small

2284
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:12,460
bike I do a really tiny bite yeah yeah

2285
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,079
and then I grow and then I do take one

2286
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:15,340
oh yeah if you can look this up on

2287
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:16,539
YouTube it's really great when like

2288
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:19,000
ferrets grabbed something that's like

2289
01:54:16,539 --> 01:54:20,829
way too long anyway and it's just like

2290
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,979
running all the way the thing with the

2291
01:54:20,829 --> 01:54:25,899
snake like trailing behind just go on I

2292
01:54:23,979 --> 01:54:27,549
can get you everywhere and if you get to

2293
01:54:25,899 --> 01:54:29,769
the hole just to pull it through yeah

2294
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:31,630
exactly exactly I think your eyes turn

2295
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:34,050
back to normal yeah what happens is she

2296
01:54:31,630 --> 01:54:39,550
you'd bite me and you'd like the

2297
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:42,449
tentacle yeah I go and then my eyes go

2298
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:48,400
back to normal I go units heard me I

2299
01:54:42,448 --> 01:54:51,009
don't make that sound what's that mean

2300
01:54:48,399 --> 01:54:52,599
all right I'm commanding you I'm making

2301
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:54,969
sure there's no sign of man coming to do

2302
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:57,219
a perception check on you okay failure

2303
01:54:54,969 --> 01:54:58,210

really good yeah

2305
01:54:58,210 --> 01:55:03,250
funny did a 20 I did a 20 it was funny

2306
01:55:01,149 --> 01:55:06,420
not only for my section here which

2307
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:09,130
everyone out of the bottom okay yeah

on the way down but as soon as your as

2355
01:57:08,788 --> 01:57:13,889
soon as you're through that that area

2356
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:17,309
there of the loose soil it really is I

2357
01:57:13,889 --> 01:57:20,368

2362
01:57:30,269 --> 01:57:35,668
different now that I'm down here and do

2363
01:57:34,439 --> 01:57:37,530
I feel different now that I'm down here

2364
01:57:35,668 --> 01:57:38,998
and seen with my own sites am i affected

2365
01:57:37,529 --> 01:57:40,559
by these let's say I was going to say

2366
01:57:38,998 --> 01:57:42,148
you've always want to walk behind you

2367
01:57:40,559 --> 01:57:44,248
yeah use all the way we're just going to

2368
01:57:42,149 --> 01:57:45,749
I guess it's not clamp your eyes if you

2369
01:57:44,248 --> 01:57:49,378
start looking at things weird you've

2370
01:57:45,748 --> 01:57:55,168
always wondered even in a temple too

2371
01:57:49,378 --> 01:57:59,908
little you never felt odd Oh God right

2372
01:57:55,168 --> 01:58:01,408
yeah you know you know you don't you

2373
01:57:59,908 --> 01:58:04,819
don't have a good sense of what it is

2374
01:58:01,408 --> 01:58:09,448
like to be in a place of communion and

2375
01:58:04,819 --> 01:58:13,889
your you know your divinity this entity

2376
01:58:09,448 --> 01:58:19,158
that you are fundamentally you know in

2377
01:58:13,889 --> 01:58:19,159
the thrall of yeah there's no

2378
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:24,579
churches for that on the corner you have

2379
01:58:22,658 --> 01:58:27,670
a search in the model yeah you have it

2380
01:58:24,579 --> 01:58:30,760
you have a sense yeah you have a sense

2381
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:33,310
that you understand what that person

2382
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:38,440
feels like what an inherent feels like

2383
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:41,260
this seems like a Cathedral this Dalek

2384
01:58:38,439 --> 01:58:46,479
do I so do I the dark light crystal can

2385
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:48,820
those camera looks do I feel like I am I

2386
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:52,178
getting any sense of like Monell is it

2387
01:58:48,819 --> 01:58:54,819
because while I want to lose can you

2388
01:58:52,179 --> 01:58:58,899
just to lose myself no in the music man

2389
01:58:54,819 --> 01:59:02,319
yeah mama forget anything no no no you

2390
01:58:58,899 --> 01:59:04,359
don't talk about games awful no yeah you

2391
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:05,889
don't feel it Queenie because I regret I

2392
01:59:04,359 --> 01:59:08,649
want to keep looking with my own eyes

2393
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:11,230
mine is I don't know leave like I could

2394
01:59:08,649 --> 01:59:13,119
pop my familiar up and then I can just

2395
01:59:11,229 --> 01:59:15,579
look through its site well it's I don't

2396
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:16,899
know I I can I won't a lot like we'd

2397
01:59:15,579 --> 01:59:18,640
leave you back in the same I'm already

2398
01:59:16,899 --> 01:59:20,948
I'm taking away still like I'm lying to

2399
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:23,409
you yes I just haven't here and I'm

2400
01:59:20,948 --> 01:59:24,189
looking through its [ __ ] your vision how

2401
01:59:23,408 --> 01:59:26,619
worried about him

2402
01:59:24,189 --> 01:59:29,079
no I got my leash I know but at the same

2403
01:59:26,619 --> 01:59:30,849
time like I remember a mirror okay I'm

2404
01:59:29,079 --> 01:59:33,670
also the only one you swung on you have

2405
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:37,420
last night yes so this you can see that

2406
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:39,850
this is sort of like I'm boldest room

2407
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:42,539
when you map it immediately to where it

2408
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:47,380
was before just your natural enthusiasm

2409
01:59:42,539 --> 01:59:48,760
for cartography you begun to apply the

2410
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:50,079
experience you have of the previous

2411
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:52,420
space you can tell just from a

2412
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:54,579
volumetric perspective like this must

2413
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:55,989
have been that chamber but you can see

2414
01:59:54,579 --> 01:59:59,500
that it's just sort of like the reverse

2415
01:59:55,988 --> 02:00:03,428
of it it's now pulled down in the front

2416
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:06,488
of you to down into darkness but there's

2417
02:00:03,429 --> 02:00:09,250
all these there's sparkles from where

2418
02:00:06,488 --> 02:00:12,789
this stone has been converted into glass

2419
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:16,960
and then as I said before the etchings

2420
02:00:12,789 --> 02:00:20,619
and symbols are growing more defined the

2421
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:23,649
farther in you get I want to do in our

2422
02:00:20,619 --> 02:00:27,069
kind of check I want the 400 one I want

2423
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:28,299
to check I want to looking for is

2424
02:00:27,069 --> 02:00:31,039
whether or not I get a sense it would be

2425
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:32,930
a wise or bad idea to

2426
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:35,210
you know some rubbings like to get some

2427
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:37,550
copies of these things just just to

2428
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:39,289
consider them even management you can

2429
02:00:37,550 --> 02:00:40,730
track you can use your identity right so

2430
02:00:39,289 --> 02:00:43,909
we'll get the second one in there

2431
02:00:40,729 --> 02:00:45,949
let's not solely this die here on the

2432
02:00:43,909 --> 02:00:50,779
advantages don't need it this time but

2433
02:00:45,949 --> 02:00:51,590
took it okay okay so you know yeah

2434
02:00:50,779 --> 02:00:54,769
that's high

2435
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:56,840
obviously I'm totally hungry yeah so you

2436
02:00:54,770 --> 02:01:00,020
have you obviously give it sheet of

2437
02:00:56,840 --> 02:01:05,569
paper in your paddock character sheet I

2438
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:11,920
do yeah yet the you try to do a rubbing

2439
02:01:05,569 --> 02:01:15,259
of it and the symbol is actually a

2440
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:19,880
couple of millimeters underneath this

2441
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:21,680
glass so you can so you can get you can

2442
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:24,770
try to get the markings you can write

2443
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:26,350
over the top and trace okay but a true

2444
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:29,630
rubbing is not possible because somehow

2445
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:31,700
the symbols are in the glass as you're

2446
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:35,319
moving down so as I said there's a grand

2447
02:01:31,699 --> 02:01:37,909
stair the sort of goes down into hell

2448
02:01:35,319 --> 02:01:40,909
okay then really that's what kind of

2449
02:01:37,909 --> 02:01:44,149
looks like before things like this one

2450
02:01:40,909 --> 02:01:46,430
that is now more of an inverse yes or it

2451
02:01:44,149 --> 02:01:49,219
was a dome dome exactly so that was

2452
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:51,470
there yeah and then it's imagine that

2453
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:52,760
shape yeah just having pulled itself

2454
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:55,789
down hmm

2455
02:01:52,760 --> 02:02:00,320
through the rock okay stared in mind as

2456
02:01:55,789 --> 02:02:02,149
if the Crypt had wandered not going to

2457
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:04,699
put any words in anyone's mouth since

2458
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:07,819
then in oh well we got there Lester

2459
02:02:04,699 --> 02:02:09,800
okay it's like the thing where they and

2460
02:02:07,819 --> 02:02:11,899
zombie movie they never say zombie yeah

2461
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:14,480
it's like a dinner where walking about

2462
02:02:11,899 --> 02:02:16,699
so long as Shamblin yeah we're The

2463
02:02:14,479 --> 02:02:19,339
Walking Dead scope okay

2464
02:02:16,699 --> 02:02:21,500
and you're not feeling weird apparently

2465
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:24,250
not okay no feel all right so let's keep

2466
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:26,659
going going assuming right so you get

2467
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:29,149
you make your way down you don't you

2468
02:02:26,659 --> 02:02:31,189
don't lose your footing but this is very

2469
02:02:29,149 --> 02:02:36,319
smooth lose my footing

2470
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:38,539
I lose my friend it was a couple down

2471
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:41,689
step I know on to thrush yeah yeah I

2472
02:02:38,539 --> 02:02:43,579
know so farther and farther and

2473
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:48,469
a little bit then it goes back in time

2474
02:02:43,579 --> 02:02:50,329
so yes as you're moving down the the

2475
02:02:48,469 --> 02:02:53,390
symbols are growing brighter as you move

2476
02:02:50,329 --> 02:02:56,659
and to the extent that not only have

2477
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:59,510
they begun - not only do they have true

2478
02:02:56,659 --> 02:03:01,909
definition and clarity but they seemed

2479
02:02:59,510 --> 02:03:04,369
to Sparkle even in the dark of the

2480
02:03:01,909 --> 02:03:06,069
cavern and the farther down you've

2481
02:03:04,369 --> 02:03:08,420
gotten there's a lot more natural

2482
02:03:06,069 --> 02:03:11,210
moisture that coolness that you felt

2483
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:14,989
earlier in the cavern has only gotten

initiative and I would love to know how

2535
02:05:35,149 --> 02:05:38,599
you can tend so as you pull your hand

2536
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:42,140
back out of it

2537
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:44,780
it's not wet right okay you pull it out

2538
02:05:42,140 --> 02:05:46,190
and now your hand is completely clean

2539
02:05:44,779 --> 02:05:48,199
okay

2540
02:05:46,189 --> 02:05:50,779
and from that do it but as you're

2541
02:05:48,199 --> 02:05:53,899
pulling it out gross it is coming out it

2542
02:05:50,779 --> 02:05:56,630
is following you out of the pool okay

2543
02:05:53,899 --> 02:05:59,149
all right essentially like a gelatinous

2544
02:05:56,630 --> 02:06:01,130
cube like this you know you're [ __ ]

2545
02:05:59,149 --> 02:06:02,779
with powers you can't possibly convey so

2546
02:06:01,130 --> 02:06:04,940
I know I don't know what that is anymore

2547
02:06:02,779 --> 02:06:08,329
I know that's a thing but I don't know

2548
02:06:04,939 --> 02:06:11,449
what it is okay I I'm going to I don't

2549
02:06:08,329 --> 02:06:14,000

2551
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,350
think bludgeoning doesn't probably so

2552
02:06:16,909 --> 02:06:19,849
actually blushing probably does

2553
02:06:18,350 --> 02:06:21,920
I think slicing generally doesn't go

2554
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:23,600
doesn't work on you all right I'm going

2555
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:28,940

2557
02:06:28,939 --> 02:06:32,329
even thinking

2558
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:35,900

2559
02:06:32,329 --> 02:06:36,710
where I draw my breath and go for it go

2560
02:06:35,899 --> 02:06:39,349
nuts with the rods

2561
02:06:36,710 --> 02:06:40,850

2565
02:06:44,539 --> 02:06:48,050
martial arts and a flurry of blows I was

2566
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:50,150
going to say you should because it

2567
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:51,829
because you wear whenever you hit with

2568
02:06:50,149 --> 02:06:54,710
the staff of the master it converts your

2569
02:06:51,829 --> 02:06:57,019
very flurry of blows into d8 that's

2570
02:06:54,710 --> 02:07:00,409
right that's right it does permanently

2571
02:06:57,020 --> 02:07:02,870

attack you don't get the bonus okay well

2575
02:07:05,810 --> 02:07:11,090
I did hit and that is already 12

2576
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:14,930

2577
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:16,640
eleven and seven cheese there's no key

reverse of a surfing wave hmm so I I see

2589
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:00,279
it as soon as you struck it it recoils

2590
02:07:58,310 --> 02:08:02,990
back or and curls around like this and

2591
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:04,729

you see rows of spines emerge and sort

2599
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:31,090
of fold themselves back into the liquid

2600
02:08:25,579 --> 02:08:34,489
and it extends a gruesome whip of

2601
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:37,460

an embodiment as I said before a

2952
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:47,728
cathedral to this entity and from each

2953
02:24:43,501 --> 02:24:53,930
of the glittering symbols in this dome

2954
02:24:47,728 --> 02:24:58,948

and they all converge on this on this

2962
02:25:27,539 --> 02:25:32,850
creature and then the symbols pulse and

2963
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:35,100
you can see it sort of in the imagine

2964
02:25:32,850 --> 02:25:38,238
that the Rays or the carrier wave and

2965
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:41,789
there's a single pulse of light and

2966
02:25:38,238 --> 02:25:44,488
malevolent pressure presses all the way

2967
02:25:41,789 --> 02:25:47,520
down compresses the creature down to

2968
02:25:44,488 --> 02:25:51,840

glowing and ruby red and you see the

2973
02:26:06,449 --> 02:26:11,248
tendrils sort of slowly pulling them

2974
02:26:08,609 --> 02:26:14,010
