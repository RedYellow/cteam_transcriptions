00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:57,030
raids must cease and you were able to

59
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,840
bring those raids to a close by

60
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:07,079
defeating what appeared to be a pirate

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:11,640
gang of goblins and after managing them

62
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:14,219
and re robbing all of the things that

63
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,629

yeah we're over sorry because it this is

86
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:27,750
how it goes you are rolling into town

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:30,509
just as people are putting together the

88
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,930
last bits of business in the open

89
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:36,889
markets you can see people taking crates

90
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:43,620
of chickens very seriously at this hour

91
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:47,759
you are rolling in via the east exit of

92
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,680
the town and right by the small cart

93
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,870
Shack saying that has been since

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,009
dismantled where you purchased three

95
00:04:51,870 --> 00:05:03,540
health potions for a mere 20 gold

96
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:05,728
incredible savings for 20 gold yeah

97
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,100
that's the stream is that the type of

98
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:12,209
stream we're operating here you tell me

99
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:17,070
listen I'm I'm 100% down um but I'm cool

100
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:18,149
I'm with a kid Nina listen Josh are you

101
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:23,189
down with nugs

102
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:28,379
so as you're rolling in you roll into

103
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:32,848
this the central bustle where you know

104
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:34,649
the harvest in 2b and there have been

105
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:39,719
changes even just in the last couple

106
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:40,459
days since you've been out since you've

107
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,690
been gone

108
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:47,989
we all know something I'm sorry I know

109
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:52,339
the holiday I had really happening and I

110
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:57,360
really I'm in a lot of pain so up

111
00:05:52,339 --> 00:06:00,560
kitty-corner across this these crowds

112
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,620
and the movement of people and currency

113
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,589
you can see that a new venue a new Inn

114
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,418
has established itself quick in the last

115
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:15,589
two days in the last two day and the

116
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:20,129
main thing the out front are two statues

117
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:23,939
fix fundamentally there is a dick aspect

118
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:26,649
to these statues and in fact right in

119
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:31,990
front of the door you can see that

120
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:35,560
streams from these peeing statues cross

121
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,600
over in front of the doorway you looking

122
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,418
at it you're not sure if it would be

123
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,120
possible to get into this place without

124
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:46,120
getting peed on like it would be a like

125
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,129
a mission impossible type situation like

126
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,030
with the beams yeah like you think that

127
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:51,370
you would have happened

128
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:53,679
no you would think this is like some

129
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,300
Ocean's eleven like you would need a

130
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,288
team yeah

131
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,090
to manage this this flow basically and

132
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:05,769
you can see the sign above that says

133
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:09,728
Grand Opening clefts clefts become

134
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:15,459
possessive over all right great

135
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:18,689
and yeah in a lost sort of ruling listen

136
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:22,439
I'm a writer to tie process I have a

137
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:27,699
point I've got a picture with your word

138
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:30,459
the Gainey's penis cookies your rating

139
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:33,098
no it's just regular it's subsurface

140
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:38,319
scattering you can take them listening

141
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:42,519
no hmm so sort of moving around I'm

142
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,139
video favorite yeah the Kings edges are

143
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,899
like a national symbol in like Belgium

144
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:48,699
so like that didn't be sure yeah yeah

145
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:52,269
but they're clearly not Elgin no I'm

146
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:55,478
picturing like the Bellagio but also

147
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:58,629
like Austin Powers yeah yeah yeah pretty

148
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:01,509
more difference - yeah exactly always

149
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,339
are no good and a low body no no imagine

150
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,629
it's a situation where it's like imagine

151
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:07,179
that you could take the dick and then

152
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:10,509
expand while retaining the ratio yeah

153
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:16,900
yeah don't dream yeah dream every night

154
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:20,038
no but you can you can see a figure who

155
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:23,788
is moving towards the harvest in and

156
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:26,829
then but after he's taken a couple steps

157
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:30,158
he turns back around towards clefts

158
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:33,610
clefts and takes a few steps and then

159
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:37,599
sort of reaches out for the statues and

160
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:40,418
then puts his hand down

161
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,419
and look back over to harvestin and

162
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:46,389
begins walking in that direction

163
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:51,879
you wrecked from the from the carriage

164
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:54,370
you recognize this somewhat flighty I

165
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,679
mean you you have had challenges with

166
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:01,389
this character in the past this is a

167
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:06,239
person who has not really taken advice

168
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:10,509
has not absorbed your maternal waves and

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,720
always has a new idea about how to find

170
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:17,139
success and it really is a a couple

171
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,300
weeks here a couple months there you

172
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,818
know that he was into magic for a little

173
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:24,189
while I just wanted him to be happy for

174
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:26,679
the first 50 years of his life but at

175
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,220
some point you get tired of it you get

176
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,939
exhausted yeah you're not listen

177
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,610
grandmother you're not telling me

178
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,120
anything that I don't know you see your

179
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,699
son de ribas who is apparently being

180
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,078
torn apart by the act of choosing an inn

181
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:45,758
I am utterly unsurprised I'm only

182
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:47,948
surprised to see him in this town not

183
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,019
that he is having trouble with this most

184
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:57,309

get this mat

410
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:58,789
heavy stone out as far as you can tell

411
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:02,370
from nowhere this black-robed figure

412
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:04,829
emerges from the other side of the cart

413
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:05,669
like a street magician sort of maneuver

414
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:09,629
yes exactly

415
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:14,730

trouble hello in exactly open oh he says

417
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:23,990
I may have a matter to discuss with you

418
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:31,139
before this statue crosses the threshold

419
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:36,480
I don't see why I would be the case are

420
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:41,310
you the artist from some zone on this

421
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:46,370
robe emerges a card and upon this card

422
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:56,490
it says pragma cleft of clefts clefts

423
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:57,119
incredible works profound topics hmm not

424
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,240
an artist

425
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:05,809
the did this but certainly other works

426
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:12,000
you might call me a patron of the Arts I

427
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:15,690
have needs in the visual space

428
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,920
I have wealth to get these to take these

429
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:24,840
concepts as they are from the ether and

430
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:29,279
form them into a solidity if you will a

431
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:31,220
good place to be I think we may have

432
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:35,399
much to discuss

433
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,380
hmm Miyabi said which I'm supposed to

434
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,430
take this dance should I take this in

435
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,380
now yeah we got a quest to complete here

436
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:47,720
but yeah we could certainly have this

437
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,720
conversation once we've returned it

438
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,250
really angry if you like general oh well

439
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,839

egg to bed don't be fussy in the morning

441
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:03,609
if you take this statue in to the

442
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:07,850
harvest in

443
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:13,069
then Hera van der dragon will have it

444
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:14,169
and that is not to my preference I'm

445
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:16,429
strange

446
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:17,630
hello I hear about your property yeah

447
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,630
yeah paid for it

448
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,170
how are you Kevin k2 thing yeah that's

449
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,140
true

450
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:28,789
well BC immersion is very confused but

451
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:32,480
not actually that I kind of I I go and

452
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:38,750
like he's not getting it is he super not

453
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:41,360
getting it I go and he's there

454
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:46,579
yeah either to struggling or now lifted

455
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:49,309
right yeah go to it and so I say to you

456
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:53,259
you want this I like I'll thieves can't

457
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:55,789
him like and I'll say so how much are

458
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:57,740
you looking to pony up for this thing

459
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,990
but I'll say isn't this a nice but looks

460
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,029
like this is some quality a selectman

461
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,400
ship here but the thieves can't

462
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:08,960
underneath I'm saying exactly picking up

463
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:12,400
any of that absolutely he responds but

464
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,680
he does so with the left eyebrow up and

465
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,370
so you know that that inverts the second

466
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:23,029
half of each frame quarter what he is

467
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:27,349
able to communicate with you is that he

468
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:29,500
is willing to offer up statuary of his

469
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:36,589
own from his private collection in

470
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:40,670
addition to lodging anytime the party is

471
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:43,730
on the long road at clefts class and he

472
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:46,630
assures you that it is it is better than

473
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,640
those who typically speak to thieves in

474
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:53,660
can expect but what this sounds like of

475
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:58,640
course is that the McRib is back I hear

476
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:01,190
that and go alright I don't follow any

477
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,750
of it it's not this here is actually

478
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,690
belongs to the proprietor of the

479
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:08,660
harvestin and so we have business to

480
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,490
conclude so if we can take care of that

481
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,690
I don't see how the two are related I'm

482

us on the quest he's got a collection he

573
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:13,579

so to help potions that we bought in

816
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:59,170
town before we set out on request I

817
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,170
believe that they are not traditional

818
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,940
health potions but I'm going to try it

819
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:06,940
on this gentleman anyway and so far as I

820
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,170
smell like LED shading yeah right what's

821
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,179
the worst could happen actually

822
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,920
something you put on a like a natural

823
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:14,049
medicine that hasn't been vetted by the

824
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,369
FDA it's like it's an alternative

825
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:21,070
healing mechanism do the healing potions

826
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:23,500
yeah it's homeopathic yeah we have two

827
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:25,930
possible options here one is that it

828
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,699
works great together is that we find out

829
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:30,539
what it does so the other is being

830
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:33,759
immoral murder your accomplice to murder

831
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:36,849
me that I produce as if from nowhere a

832
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,730
document and I hold it up to him

833
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:42,699
and I now we're not legally responsible

834
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,190
for anything that happens to you are you

835
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:47,710
so much and I take the quill I love a

836
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,840
kiss ang and I sign what could be his

837
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,170
name is just like a graphical yeah yeah

838
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,050
yeah

839
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:57,340
and then I put that away it really it is

840
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:59,830
but man yeah right magma flexes like

841
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:03,210
that's what even is name another guy man

842
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:06,429
and then you think that our individual

843
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:09,490
elevated appreciating that yeah hmm we

844
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:11,769
have my basket so you roll him over

845
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:14,559
yeah it's squash e'er maybe then you

846
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:15,730
would like yeah on the front own well

847
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,130
I'm trying to find his mouth

848
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:20,380
there ya go no you can find that okay I

849
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:22,930
find a hole and I pour it in alright I'd

850
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,570
have a bundle uncork it and the bottoms

851
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:30,339
up folks and just going on down in the

852
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:39,600
car you see you see the bone structure

853
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:43,180
hmm good warp and liquid ever see Rose

854
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,929
you see if you got home you see it you

855
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:54,529
see it fill out and become symmetrical

856
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:57,980
and then you see a metallic sheen creep

857
00:43:54,530 --> 00:44:01,160
from the mouth and begin to cover the

858
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:04,519
entire body I want to do in our cat a

859
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:06,019
check like as you know [ __ ] gets weird

860
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:12,489
yeah yes with a little bit let's see it

861
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:18,050
oh man that's a great big ha 17 okay

862
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:20,689
yeah yeah this is he is apparently as a

863
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:23,210
result of this potion and you begin to

864
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,970
get very curious about its manufacture

865
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,320
so I get down I was already kind of like

866
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:29,449
checking them out I was worried about

867
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,840
him yeah yeah and I'm going to look at

868
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:32,389
that

869
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:35,539
it's very conscious is this going to be

870
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:37,129
like interesting interesting side effect

871
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,840
or it's like this will spread and then

872
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:45,519
he will calcify and turn into metal and

873
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:48,680
die so he appears to be coated in a

874
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,409
metal it would take you would need a

875
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:54,919
much better number to know what metal

876
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:56,929
but you can feel over his mouth that

877
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,900
he's still breathing okay

878
00:44:56,929 --> 00:45:02,059
but he is completely encased in metal

879
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:05,030
okay also through that process I did

880
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:08,059
pick his pockets okay that's a difficult

881
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:10,610
I thought anything anything you didn't

882
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:13,070
see it mom I'm super good at this it's

883
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:16,099
about eight gold three copper which is

884
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:18,920
called ketosis childlike innocence it's

885
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:22,190
you know I'm super good at this no we

886
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:25,460
saw so there's a heavy heavy statue is

887
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:27,260
down rolled away yeah and there's also

888
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,579
apparently a statue of a man I was

889
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,280
reverence or statue

890
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:32,659
so we problem up and flick ERISA panel i

891
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,840
really light is allowed to go to sleep

892
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:37,549
guys really tired I will be able to the

893
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,220
am Gemini the thing that we could maybe

894
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:43,190
do okay and it's that we could join go

895
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:45,379
to class and because it's well known

896
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,760
that their adversaries blackmail him

897
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,820
into helping us because people will

898
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:52,400
probably think he did it and not a

899
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:54,710
walnut it was on grad yeah friend is

900
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,539

before 20 yet

902
00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:01,789
anything all the factors go out the door

903
00:45:58,429 --> 00:46:04,160
no but that is the same well I guess

904
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:05,319
that is something that we could I'm

905
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,668

a different angle at different

1131
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:43,300

that his fellows

1520
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:25,078

1521
01:16:21,569 --> 01:16:27,238
swipe that you cleverly shift out of the

1522
01:16:25,078 --> 01:16:29,658
way and the other one is also a piece of

1523
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:29,658

this is five lesser tendrils that burst

1602
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:30,589
out individually from the bodies of

1603
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:35,350
these rafts and then begin to rise

1604
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:42,680
around the field like jagged serpents um

1798
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:26,940
they seem to have a different mo but the

1799
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:29,090
rest of them are our skirmishers they're

1800
01:30:26,939 --> 01:30:30,899
interested in checking out the cart

1801
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:34,590
couldn't even take care of discovery

1802
01:30:30,899 --> 01:30:39,029
exactly right cool but these these will

1803
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:46,100
these wargs are sniffing the air um and

1804
01:30:39,029 --> 01:30:49,109
they immediately leap toward dinar oh oh

1805
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:53,640
god damn it the game against rule right

1806
01:30:49,109 --> 01:30:56,399
so that night the Beastmaster atop the

1807
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:59,460
single headed board curls a javelin that

1808
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:03,929
goes right over your shoulder the rule

1809
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:10,319
of work itself Kristin our know how ya

1810
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:12,510
ward kid oh [ __ ] okay that's sorry was

1811
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:16,019
it a lot that's nine points of damage

1812
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:22,500

javelin goes over the shoulder and that

1818
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:41,610

do that bonus action getting up is my

1844
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:15,179
other action or is that my move yes okay

1845
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:18,350
uh so these are wargs with pilots on

1846
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:23,039
them yes yeah um

1847
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:25,560
so I go to the one that's messing with

1848
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:28,050
me and I technically they're both

1849
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:30,630
missing yes the one that's messing with

1850
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:32,460
you the worst the double head I guess

1851
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:35,819
the double heavy on seems more dangerous

1852
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:39,869
the one I have more HP uh so I yell at

1853
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:41,250
the driver with command and speak a

1854
01:33:39,869 --> 01:33:43,140
one-word command to a creature you can

1855
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:46,020
see within range target must succeed on

1856
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:48,449
a wisdom saving throw and I safely okay

1857
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,699
you can get get going yeah

1858
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:52,469
very smart that's really good yeah

1859
01:33:50,698 --> 01:34:02,009
that's did a really learning wizard say

1860
01:33:52,469 --> 01:34:03,840
yeah I should have no waste lightning no

1861
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:04,590

1862
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,449
ducky

1863
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:11,099
that enrollment sucks cuz he was gonna

1864
01:34:06,448 --> 01:34:13,309
fit um he barks a few commands there's

1865
01:34:11,099 --> 01:34:16,079
there's a commonality almost between the

1866
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:18,539
speech of the warg and the speech of the

1867
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:20,300
Goblin he barks a couple commands and

1868
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:23,429
then you can tell that one of the heads

1869
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:25,279
doesn't want to follow the command one

1870
01:34:23,429 --> 01:34:28,949
of the heads wants to get another bite

1871
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:33,238
at that juicy dinar went and he does so

1872
01:34:28,948 --> 01:34:35,460
layer 20 a see you yeah yeah but he

1873
01:34:33,238 --> 01:34:38,848
wrote a nineteen minutes plus of cream

1874
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:41,969
on so you take three points but he is

1875
01:34:38,849 --> 01:34:44,760
able to pull the beast he is able to

1876
01:34:41,969 --> 01:34:47,670
pull the Beast away and they run down

1877
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:49,739

01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:49,460
creatures before and now having to

1901
01:35:44,609 --> 01:35:52,439
imagine them as described which one

1902
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:55,859
would be worse if they came back the

1903
01:35:52,439 --> 01:35:57,960

dissonant whisper to the one that's

1906
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:06,269
that's the most likely to stay away

1907
01:36:02,849 --> 01:36:10,619
these these goblins are definitely a cut

1908
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:13,409

1954
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:17,980
markedly different looking than the

01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:20,500
other angry wolf this is not like a wolf

1956
01:38:17,979 --> 01:38:24,069

01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:25,899
natural wolf a big big big boy only one

1958
01:38:24,069 --> 01:38:28,619

01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:57,960
of you over there maybe I did feel good

1969
01:38:54,948 --> 01:39:02,488
so they're right so the goblins that are

1970
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:04,770
surrounding her like is probably there's

1971
01:39:02,488 --> 01:39:06,238
one two of them are rolling around over

1972
01:39:04,770 --> 01:39:07,890
just dance or one of them is rolling

1973
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,049
around two of them are getting there

1974
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:13,079
when it's been nice one is trying to

1975
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:14,489
ride this thing and got bad English and

1976
01:39:13,079 --> 01:39:16,289
then there's and there's a loose one

1977
01:39:14,488 --> 01:39:18,238
that is near dinar but they're all very

1978
01:39:16,289 --> 01:39:21,840
close together it's a bit of pitch to

1979
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:24,448
melee okay so I can't I could not manage

1980
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,430
like burning hands to get a Kyle of them

1981
01:39:24,448 --> 01:39:27,869
I would say I wouldn't use burning hands

1982
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:29,430
or thunder waves

1983
01:39:27,869 --> 01:39:31,948
I mean I would yeah a lot of those

1984
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:34,949
spells I would say that's a dangerous

1985
01:39:31,948 --> 01:39:37,829

into his chest to push him onto the

2092
01:44:56,310 --> 01:45:03,150
ground and vault over him mm-hmm to use

2093
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:06,118

front door and in your peripheral vision

2527
02:06:11,529 --> 02:06:18,029
you can see hair of and our dragon out

2528
02:06:13,569 --> 02:06:20,380
in what you assume is his night where

2529
02:06:18,029 --> 02:06:24,880
it's very similar to stay where honestly

2530
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:28,210
yeah great um except it has a cat you

2531
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:30,699

2532
02:06:28,210 --> 02:06:41,109
was full of people earlier and that is

2533
02:06:30,698 --> 02:06:43,750
when Ruby snakes burnt yes yeah oh I was

rolling a lot of dice yeah no you feel

2535
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:50,520
you can feel him lose his footing on the

2536
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:55,960
back as I I think that is good for him

2537
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:58,270
yep he loses his footing on the back and

2538
02:06:55,960 --> 02:07:00,399
you you see him fall in a heap to the

2539
02:06:58,270 --> 02:07:01,949
left of you and then you see him you see

2540
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:05,319
him raise his dagger

2541
02:07:01,948 --> 02:07:10,569
defiantly but then you see directly from

2542
02:07:05,319 --> 02:07:13,779
his palm erupts a ruby serpent

2543
02:07:10,569 --> 02:07:15,519
sorry you didn't get to do this he looks

2544
02:07:13,779 --> 02:07:18,509
at it in terror for a moment before he

2545
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:22,120
collapses and then another Ruby serpent

2546
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:25,300
erupts and they appear to be fighting

2547
02:07:22,119 --> 02:07:29,439
over the bloody dagger cool that's

2548
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:33,159

2584
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:33,090
the index finger of a left-handed more

2585
02:09:29,850 --> 02:09:38,909
than I don't I say I say I need

2586
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:41,190
estimates from three contractors and

2587
02:09:38,908 --> 02:09:42,329
then we'll settle up and if you want to

2588
02:09:41,189 --> 02:09:44,279
make a real point of this then we'll

2589
02:09:42,329 --> 02:09:49,019
talk about the safety of the people that

2590
02:09:44,279 --> 02:09:51,448
you guaranteed space and you're in very

2591
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:55,590
impressed never watch I'm just a lady

2592
02:09:51,448 --> 02:09:59,219

2593
02:09:55,590 --> 02:10:01,679
he learn this lesson one wonders and he

2594
02:09:59,219 --> 02:10:07,198
does it he says I need the address of

clothing a broken one and that one is no

2598
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:24,120
glass and this one I think that this was

2599
02:10:18,988 --> 02:10:27,448
a hit job from a bald man pragma cleft

2600
02:10:24,119 --> 02:10:29,880
my gloves class incredible works for

2601
02:10:27,448 --> 02:10:33,988
found topics I think I think he hired

2602
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:38,130
them and I think that perhaps in little

2603
02:10:33,988 --> 02:10:40,709
rebus paying you I like this I like this

2604
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:43,020

02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:48,989
to see some social skills liberating

2607
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:52,159
because I have to say I do like I do

2608
02:10:48,988 --> 02:10:56,029
like the rhetorical yeah strategy

2609
02:10:52,158 --> 02:10:59,549
because as we know his affection for

2610
02:10:56,029 --> 02:11:03,529
pragma cleft is really at an all-time

2611
02:10:59,550 --> 02:11:07,230
low minuscule okay I will grab a mass oh

2612
02:11:03,529 --> 02:11:09,899
yeah sounds real good yeah all right so

2613
02:11:07,229 --> 02:11:13,109
um I wouldn't it's been much been a tale

2614
02:11:09,899 --> 02:11:14,638
for me okay grandmother okay listen my

2615
02:11:13,109 --> 02:11:18,389
son as I mentioned colossal

2616
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:19,319
disappointment but I do not he nods

2617
02:11:18,389 --> 02:11:22,260
considerably

2618
02:11:19,319 --> 02:11:23,429
yeah you probably met young men like

2619
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:26,730
this in your in your time

2620
02:11:23,429 --> 02:11:29,550
but I do think there was a scrap and

2621
02:11:26,729 --> 02:11:32,549
straight with you and pragma and he

2622
02:11:29,550 --> 02:11:33,989
seems to really enjoy stealing statue

2623
02:11:32,550 --> 02:11:36,128
that he belongs to you now

2624
02:11:33,988 --> 02:11:39,098
she believed that belong to you

2625
02:11:36,128 --> 02:11:42,069
we have a statue belong to you going in

2626
02:11:39,099 --> 02:11:44,260
our carts and I think that it's his

2627
02:11:42,069 --> 02:11:46,029
fault he hired these goblins to try to

2628
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:46,479
steal just to make your life a living

2629
02:11:46,029 --> 02:11:48,938
hell

2630
02:11:46,479 --> 02:11:52,510
we got caught the mill but let's focus

2631
02:11:48,939 --> 02:12:00,760
on pragma cleft let's get let's get some

2634
02:12:07,628 --> 02:12:18,639
middle of the night yeah and re-enters

2635
02:12:11,828 --> 02:12:23,168
his in and emerges from the end with

2636
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:26,139
what looks like a Smith's hammer and you

2637
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:27,519
see him crossing the street he's going

2638
02:12:26,139 --> 02:12:31,378

threads right now I know uh in it in a

2640
02:12:31,378 --> 02:12:43,319
with poise dignity and purpose and then

2641
02:12:37,179 --> 02:12:48,128
you can see that you can see the spray

2642
02:12:43,319 --> 02:12:52,929
ghost going wild starts out as a as a

2643
02:12:48,128 --> 02:12:57,038
precise arc and then like each overhand

2644
02:12:52,929 --> 02:13:04,029
swing of this Smith's hammer it becomes

2645
02:12:57,038 --> 02:13:05,889

2731
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:43,469
at all it is a rich wooden base a topic

2732
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:48,728
is a likeness of parov and our dragon

2733
02:17:43,468 --> 02:17:53,108
the loose silken tunic no pants

2734
02:17:48,728 --> 02:17:55,629
whoo and what's the second uh it's just

2735
02:17:53,109 --> 02:18:01,659
it's there's product she's moving like

2736
02:17:55,629 --> 02:18:03,808
and we can sleep and then at his feet he

2737
02:18:01,659 --> 02:18:07,929
sort of like laughing into the distance

2738
02:18:03,808 --> 02:18:10,198
and then with him on that Dyess is the

2739
02:18:07,929 --> 02:18:15,710
crushed and broken

2740
02:18:10,199 --> 02:18:18,500
pragma cleft beneath a statue

2741
02:18:15,709 --> 02:18:20,898
of this sort that hairband our dragon

2742
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:24,888
specializes analyzing not as a table

2743
02:18:20,898 --> 02:18:27,648
yeah yeah and then there is a written

2744
02:18:24,888 --> 02:18:30,289
around the base in the wood it says the

2745
02:18:27,648 --> 02:18:34,058
victory of hair of and our dragon over

2746
02:18:30,290 --> 02:18:34,059
the vile rogue pragma cleft

2747
02:18:34,299 --> 02:18:38,959
we get Antiques Roadshow like what do

2748
02:18:37,579 --> 02:18:41,238
you think excelling at mice for this

2749
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:42,558
because all that's a pragma yes he would

2750
02:18:41,238 --> 02:18:44,329

2755
02:18:52,879 --> 02:18:58,398
I think this might be a kind of a great

2756
02:18:54,769 --> 02:19:00,260
memory of our adventures Becca if it had

2757
02:18:58,398 --> 02:19:02,568
a collar fit as a value it's apparently

2758
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:05,029
the only thing that that drives this

2759
02:19:02,568 --> 02:19:07,840
enterprise yeah yeah we're the art lover

2760
02:19:05,029 --> 02:19:07,840

2762
02:19:11,478 --> 02:19:23,028
was very good so you are rolling south

2763
02:19:15,799 --> 02:19:26,148
on the long road back toward red larch

2764
02:19:23,029 --> 02:19:28,159
we are we equal or any of us not driving

2765
02:19:26,148 --> 02:19:30,318
I'll be able to take shifts arrests

2766
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:32,388
absolutely enough time this week

2767
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:34,250
yeah yeah there's nothing if you can get

2768
02:19:32,388 --> 02:19:37,429
the rest of the you can get the rest

2769
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:45,398
that you crave of the dead yeah from

2770
02:19:37,429 --> 02:19:48,500
before you pull into town about midday

2771
02:19:45,398 --> 02:19:54,139
you're familiar now with the bustle of

2772
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:57,170
red larch at its busiest it's not too

2773
02:19:54,139 --> 02:20:03,909
busy yeah um it's not on the sign

2774
02:19:57,170 --> 02:20:08,600
exactly it's not too busy the end but

2775
02:20:03,909 --> 02:20:09,949
but I get it you roll down the you roll

2776
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:13,390
down the Main Street which is just

2777
02:20:09,949 --> 02:20:17,840

2778
02:20:13,389 --> 02:20:21,948

02:24:50,060 --> 02:24:53,750
if these guys didn't to like you know

2876
02:24:53,091 --> 02:24:55,280

02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:58,040
to be doing that sort of thing but I'm

2878
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:59,780
all about the looting now I was too

2879
02:24:58,040 --> 02:25:01,450
drunk to remember that I'm probably

02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:04,130
asleep in the back of the reason I Drive

2881
02:25:01,450 --> 02:25:07,460
in it I'm pretty hard exactly

2882
02:25:04,129 --> 02:25:10,219
I'm living so that I would consider

2883
02:25:07,459 --> 02:25:11,989

2887
02:25:15,709 --> 02:25:19,729
not being like okay ten minutes to loot

2888
02:25:17,629 --> 02:25:22,789
these guys well keep in mind creative

2889
02:25:19,729 --> 02:25:24,159
spell use the tentacle salute the idea

2890
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:26,330
right why didn't you think of that

2891
02:25:24,159 --> 02:25:30,979
exactly I had some lessons to teach my

2892
02:25:26,329 --> 02:25:31,760
boys yeah I got a lot of parenting good

2893
02:25:30,979 --> 02:25:36,289
yeah exactly

2894
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:41,030
oh you guys yes but that's that's the

2895
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:42,410
situation that is before you okay so the

2896
02:25:41,030 --> 02:25:47,480
as we approach to goblins

2897
02:25:42,409 --> 02:25:50,450
they're not giving us any flex okay hey

2898
02:25:47,479 --> 02:25:54,409
we're we're the local acquisitions in

2899
02:25:50,450 --> 02:25:56,420
ink franchise we're here to I believe a

2900
02:25:54,409 --> 02:26:00,559
dimension at the mention of acquisitions

2901
02:25:56,420 --> 02:26:03,319
Inc one of the lips curls up and you can

2902
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:05,269
just see a hint of a thing behind it and

2903
02:26:03,319 --> 02:26:08,899
then it goes back to have a beautiful

2904
02:26:05,270 --> 02:26:11,090
smile net we have some documentation if

2905
02:26:08,899 --> 02:26:12,709
we need to prove that we belong here

2906
02:26:11,090 --> 02:26:14,350
one of them just not just head toward

2907
02:26:12,709 --> 02:26:17,750
the door okay

2908
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:19,850

2909
02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:22,340

02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:24,290
our Goblin yeah well we know on the way

2911
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:25,729

2913
02:26:25,729 --> 02:26:28,430
touching my necklace with before goblin

when you get in

2920
02:26:43,149 --> 02:26:53,359
prophetess drawn is behind the bar and

2921
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:57,649
very pronounced he has a hand on a rag

2922
02:26:53,360 --> 02:27:00,380
on top of the bar and her hand is

2923
02:26:57,649 --> 02:27:02,859
clearly holding something below the bar

2924
02:27:00,379 --> 02:27:07,339
okay

2925
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:11,659
the drawing courier is completely empty

2926
02:27:07,340 --> 02:27:15,380
up for a single Goblin mm-hmm who is

2927
02:27:11,659 --> 02:27:19,850

02:27:19,850 --> 02:27:30,069
special ear expectation the skin looks

2930
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:38,380
lightly scarred as if by flame but with

2931
02:27:30,069 --> 02:27:41,689
the with the care of a magical healer

2932
02:27:38,379 --> 02:27:43,369
right so smooth but you can tell that

2933
02:27:41,689 --> 02:27:49,100
there was a grievous injury at some

2934
02:27:43,370 --> 02:27:52,810
point in his past after we thought okay

Stalin to try to distract him a little

2941
02:28:06,829 --> 02:28:10,579

little dry can I get you another one

2962
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:21,219
yeah his his brow furrows okay not a

2963
02:29:17,299 --> 02:29:21,219
common speaker yeah he says

2964
02:29:21,610 --> 02:29:33,860
acquisitions incorporated ffs why uh

2965
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:36,610
money mostly right yeah what what why

2966
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:36,610
what do you ask

2967
02:29:36,819 --> 02:29:42,340
I'm going to give you a piece of advice

2968
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:45,020
you can do what you want to with it

2969
02:29:42,340 --> 02:29:50,829
don't trust acquisitions incorporate it

2970
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:55,430
and certainly don't trust almond wrong

2971
02:29:50,829 --> 02:29:58,430
okay ah you look he moves his glass old

2972
02:29:55,430 --> 02:30:03,229
it looks in the base pushes it forward

2973
02:29:58,430 --> 02:30:07,670
okay leave something on the table under

2974
02:30:03,229 --> 02:30:09,680
his palm and walks out the front okay

2975
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:16,030
what did he leave on the table it is a

2976
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:19,720
small white card like that take a look

2977
02:30:16,030 --> 02:30:24,010
says care of splooge off the returned

2978
02:30:19,719 --> 02:30:27,670
and there is a symbol at the base of it

2979
02:30:24,010 --> 02:30:30,829
that you recognize but it's a it's a

2980
02:30:27,670 --> 02:30:33,440
corruption of a symbol that you know so

2981
02:30:30,829 --> 02:30:37,459
imagine the symbol of acquisitions

2982
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:40,579
incorporated with its proud lines the a

2983
02:30:37,459 --> 02:30:44,679
over the I imagined it inverted in such

2984
02:30:40,579 --> 02:30:47,360
a way that it is an eye and then a V and

2985
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:55,809
then below that in rough characters it

2986
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:59,360
says of the six okay that is all we have

2987
02:30:55,809 --> 02:31:02,779
