they had escaped from the haunted house

66
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:59,469
realm of NEMA's ear and authentically

67
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:05,310
evil City a corruption of the druidic

68
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:05,310
ways that walnut dong grass represents

69
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:13,000
specifically some kind of sorceress

70
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:16,360
manipulation of their natural power a

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,560
siege engine used in times fast called

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,540
an EM Azir had been converted to

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:28,739
essentially grow an entire city from a

74
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:33,729
seed a seed of which walnut on grass has

75
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,739
in her possession now and then once she

76
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:39,280
plucked this seed the entire city was

77
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:43,959
torn apart by a defier plant just like

78
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,789
this at its core upon leaving obviously

79
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,069
very action-packed you're welcome to

80
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:50,069
examine the archive for more info

81
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:59,580
functionally speaking seeds were planted

82
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:04,840
to mark the occasion by walnut they were

83
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:07,630
dryads seeds noted denizens and

84
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,700
protectors of the natural world planted

85
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:12,099
on the hill that overlooks that town

86
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:15,399
that was at least one last you saw it

87
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:18,668
being absolutely aggressively brutally

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,120
reclaimed into the bulk of the crypt

89
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:23,939

I really but it's not because it's your

107
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,509
best friend if there's a modification

108
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:16,060
that's required there I would leave it

but it is it is definitely it is

110
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:25,649

111
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:29,528
returned a glossy bronze coke over a

112
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:35,318
living structure of you know muscular

113
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:39,158
roots and nice yeah hell yeah now an

114
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,009
appetite for yes compensation exactly an

115
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:47,259
enthusiast perhaps an over-enthusiastic

116
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:51,490
gold coins yeah as a treat and maybe

117
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:56,278
even her entire diet so but as I

118
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:58,360
suggested you had returned to read large

119
00:05:56,278 --> 00:06:00,879
acquisitions incorporated desra and

120
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,639
branch centered in the drama and

121
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,830
courtier operated by prophetess drawn

122
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,778
what time of day is it right now it was

123
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:09,338
midday when we really left

124
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:10,389
yeah yeah exactly so you can write up

125
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:14,168
there you know yeah you have you have

126
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:19,718
returns we can we can snap right back in

127
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:24,609
half let us suggest to stitch the two

128
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:28,028
games together that a cinnamon cake is

129
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:31,348
now being withdrawn so to speak right

130
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:35,228
from the oven right and connector

131
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:37,329
withdrawn withdrawing courtiers I I want

132
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,189
I want to let you guys know that the

133
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,899
cinnamon cake doesn't look like anything

134
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:42,579
special I think that probably

135
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:46,329
what you expected to see with something

136
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:49,538
a little more decorous but the kitchen

137
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:51,909
in the drona Cordia is not especially

138
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:54,699
well-appointed for the construction of

139
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,900
pastries so I had to do what I could

140
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:02,050
with what I had but I think you'll find

141
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:06,129
that the flavor and texture of this cake

142
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,500
is I don't want to spoil it for you but

143
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,939
I can't believe it's not magic but this

144
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,689
is a we allowed to have it I thought it

145
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,029
was for profit

146
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:14,560
I think I baked it for profit but I

147
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:17,049
suspect profit might be willing to share

148
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,209
it's the entire thing but if I would say

149
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,759
so I take a moment is it that was

150
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:23,799
grandma's fought out like I don't know a

151
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,870
grandma who doesn't just like go in

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,340
there and make plucking the gold and

153
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,550
then bring it out it's like you're like

154
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,079
what the grandma is like well there

155
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,000
was stuff I had laying around right

156
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,728
exactly they didn't have the kind of

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,788
clarified butter that I choose to use in

158
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:42,329

00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:44,918

163
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:59,168

186
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,789
fork no and also probably didn't wash

187
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:04,229
ever but definitely not after our last

188
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:07,069
encounter to us Bloods all until we went

189
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,860
some places recently it maybe yeah

190
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:14,730
minutes or blah all over you

191
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:18,029
better day okay fine

192
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,710
Monday's am i right kind of but this is

193
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,039
this is what I'm talking about it's just

194
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,290
like full-on just like but no it's not

195
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,699
it's not even a thing right grabbing

196
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:28,709
handfuls like eating it like an apple

197
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,110
right yeah all right then

198
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,540
it sounds like it's consistency is that

199
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,759
which would allow for you to pick up and

200
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,179
grab invite but once you get it in your

201
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:42,029
mouth it dissolves like butter

202
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:43,769
yeah I guess yeah it just wait another

203
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:47,699
part where we find our poison this is

204
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:51,600
like a george RR martin are you talking

205
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,830
about audience member whistles the

206
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,750
chroman have a lamprey pie in the oven

207
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,480
anxious there's a THS i don't i don't

208
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,279
know if it's actually from the book or

209
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,529
if it is just something that I made up

210
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,019
like as an amalgamation of hold the food

211
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,480
stuff do you need you have a mental

212
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:13,079
image from the first game of thrones

213
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,509
book of beef juice running down a

214
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,389
woman's arm into her dress probably I

215
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:21,689
don't have a read I hope what I heard I

216
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:23,490
heard that mmm I hope that I did not

217
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,950
invent that because I usually use that

218
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,870
to make fun of him which is but it

219
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,720
wouldn't but if what's actually happened

220
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,190
is that I made that up then we have to

221
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
make fun of you well it's an easier now

222
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:38,670
yes Owen okay and if he has either died

223
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:41,849
or refute son let them see it he'll go

224
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:42,889
but jake has been sliced I've also made

225
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,570
coffee

226
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:48,000

I made you coffee weeks ago so I already

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,340
rented coffee I got nice copy of ancient

229
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,080
yeah I'm insured okay because indeed

230
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,360
coffees JD copter and you don't have

231
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,860
coverage

232
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,079
yeah it is like a cup of Dunkin Donuts

233
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,509
coffee our place

234
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:08,679
branding facing outwards wow that's a

235
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:10,850
handle jug yeah none of this is real

236
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,838
it's real it's from the cook garden for

237
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,089
us and as well most people are

238
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,970
specialized in brewing it range here

239
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,709

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,810
perspiring on the table yeah one drop

00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:23,419
that goes all the way down yeah so

242
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:27,018
refreshing but good why is your father

244
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,659

you you eat okay um I'm from everywhere

246
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:37,100
I'm going machine you're eating very

247
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,339
slowly delicately from a piece and I'm

248
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,480
just kind of watching walnut and you

249
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,670
guys I don't know what you guys are up

250
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,800
to please roleplay this out but I'm

251
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:49,789
waiting sectors you're stuffing your fat

252
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:54,319
face okay good I'm not stuffing it I'm

253
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:56,539
small a like a mouse but I do say the

254
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,000
destruction of an unnatural city and now

255
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,740
Kate could take a picnics great day yeah

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,409
leaving shells and homeless Souls

257
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:08,389
whatever happens I yeah we sure did some

258
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:10,399
good work did I have yeah good job see I

259
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:11,230
really feel like we're starting to pull

260
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,909
together

261
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:17,389
clink Forks and I put my fork out to

262
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:19,669
clean as a toast so we do have to be

263
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:22,069
dragged aboard sue has refugees have

264
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:23,599
they had to come as far as red large I

265
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,430
may be even further the number of people

266
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,949
displaced by the city you've only

267
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:30,819
recently arrived back in the house truth

268
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:34,639
you might see you might see things

269
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,500
change here but as you left you saw

270
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,078
people going north

271
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,990
you saw carts you know rolling to a stop

272
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:46,099
even people coming out of the city

273
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,509
finding passage with the vehicles

274
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,570
because River it sits along the long

275
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:53,448
road so you think that West bridge would

276
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,640
probably absorb more people closer to

277
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:56,958
NEMA's ear than red larch probably okay

278
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,149
that Trevor is going to do a business

279
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,669
and then I've been is going to do a

280
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:03,708
business good for Trevor great I mean I

281
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:04,329
do a good yes oh yeah yeah oh my god I'm

282
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:07,329
on idea

283
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:11,980
yes yeah yeah she doesn't really know me

284
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:13,720
this is in the case um yeah we sure did

285
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:18,190
a lot of good work you sure did

286
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,480
you sure did walnut uh yep does anybody

287
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,310

288
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,360
this mess of the head office because

289
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:25,359
otherwise I'm just going to button it up

290
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:29,139
I cut and dry um I think we could

291
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,360
probably stand to include maybe a little

292
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:32,759
explanation of what the just

293
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,500
happened

294
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,029
well mo looks down looks really serious

295
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,750
has just kind of been preparing for this

296
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:43,959
moment and she goes well what I can tell

297
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:50,620
you is this was my intention to share

298
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:54,129
this but the you know heat of our battle

299
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:58,840
I guess some things came out my people

300
00:13:54,129 --> 00:14:05,799
work from where that city was they're

301
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:06,899
gone now and that city had to go so good

302
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,269
job

303
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:16,029
what where is where did where did they

304
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:19,179
go good you're just placed but kind of

305
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,829
like I am way if you do you know where

306
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:25,779
they are are there any left

307
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:30,210
yeah I'm lost and it's my job to get

308
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:35,860
vengeance for them which I've done so

309
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:40,389
years of toiling for that is that an end

310
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,300
and what I do next is well that's my

311
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:46,980
business right vengeance

312
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:52,269
yeah they all killed

313
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:55,750

will said because you know doesn't it

318
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:16,030

320
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:24,399

that you don't want you seen it I wish I

448
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,519

458
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:48,690

answers as well ugh okay

465
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:14,859
it seems that your your group must have

466
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:17,980
had some history with this this opposing

467
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:19,808
force that they would bring that symbol

468
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,610
which I won't do because I don't have

469
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:24,700
enough hands sure I guess I guess we got

470
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:25,599
easy to fight it don't ya sorry we know

471
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,308
we're talking about

472
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:34,959
but there must have been something

473
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:37,629
seriously interconnected that would not

474
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,259
only lead them to the site of your

475
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:44,230
former birthplace but also connected

476
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:48,429
with the Crypt and connected to the ER

477
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:52,329
on my focus and the god I one day hope

478
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:55,030
to surge instead of this the yucky one I

479
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,619
don't like that much I'll talk about I

480
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:58,298
don't want you to talk about anything

481
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:02,678
I don't know if I can hear the yucky

482
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:08,700
ones like the only one the grain yuck

483
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:10,990
Smith so what are you asking you want to

484
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,730
know all the deep dark secrets in

485
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,539
history of my people yes sure let me

486
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:20,140
just know what about just some of them

487
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:22,720
that would assist us top three maybe

488
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,299
there could be yeah start at the start

489
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,009
of like the the lightest secrets it's

490
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:29,109
like the ones that a lot of people do no

491
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:31,839
I'm just saying okay and then we could

492
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:34,539
maybe see a face I'll tell you that if

493
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,339
you tell me what your end goal is would

494
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:40,089
you big creepy under the ground demon

495
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:44,439
God because thanks for a second because

496
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:48,009
there's a lot at risk but in accordance

497
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:53,930
with money with ketosis ideals and his

498
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:56,879
bonds he has decided that

499
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,049
this is possibly a worthwhile exchange

500
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,120
of information

501
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:02,099
oh wow from the kitchen you guys here

502
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:09,119
Rosie go actually you're really good

503
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:14,399
this a large clang light and not the

504
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:16,619
right size not a dragon for kitchen now

505
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,160
this is not an anywhere in kitchen in

506
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:28,428
every respect when I came to read larch

507
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:32,910
I had amnesia I had made a pact with

508
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:37,710
this other god this intercessor this god

509
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:43,850
of mouths who promised information about

510
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:50,100
the beige I seek I made a deal with it

511
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:54,209
and to this point I don't see a reason

512
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:58,969
not to proceed with it as long as I can

513
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:01,079
learn that which I seek to learn if

514
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:07,380
there was another way to get that

515
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:12,389
information I would abandon this red god

516
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:15,300
of eating meat and mouths because I

517
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:17,580
believe that the God I'm seeking is

518
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:21,299
stronger than it I believe we got I seek

519
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:24,359
is stronger than all of them and that it

520
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:30,539
would protect me that it would there

521
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:31,558
would be safety there okay well you told

522
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,159
me something so I guess it's only fair

523
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:37,319
that I would tell you something some

524
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,558
thing of of my people don't want it

525
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:42,450
looks really serious and she goes on one

526
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,589
of our greatest secrets is that if

527
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,069
you're trying to get information out of

528
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:50,230
someone don't say your thing first growl

529
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:50,230
[Applause]

534
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:09,440
opposite

535
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:13,720
tear down we had we had a gentlemen's

536
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,259
agreement of sorts I believed great but

537
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,059
husband for sweets you know even yeah

538

her name is malice of a traitor and she

539
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:28,009
must be stopped

540
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:31,579

541
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:33,640
symbol do I know anything about meals

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:40,790
when we were in Nemus here yeah that is

544
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:47,000
hidden ringing this set of druidic

545
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:52,490
knowledge and druidic pantheon and under

546
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,579
dark warlock there's no overlap there

547
00:26:52,490 --> 00:27:00,019
yeah in terms of that you haven't heard

548
00:26:55,579 --> 00:27:03,279
anything bad nothing specific but that

549
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:05,450
but that feels true to you knowing from

550
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,129
knowing it as you do that you basically

551
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,160
bear this symbol on your chest

552
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,960
constantly you believe that that is the

553
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,300
name of that symbol you believe it the

554
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,920
same way that you know that there is the

555
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,779
name of the other simple sounds true

556
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,100
sounds right yeah yeah they say the same

557
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:24,710
thing I think we have the same pain I

558
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:27,619
don't know why you call her the betrayer

559
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:32,750
I don't know that I need to know why but

560
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:35,029
both of us are trying to expunge her you

561
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:38,680
from a much larger surface area than me

562
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:44,539
I just want her out of here short but

563
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:49,640
same goal I'll say this our aim is the

564
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:51,769
same we do need to dispel her in any

565
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,750
place that we see her but you should

566
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:55,279
know that milk wasn't always the

567
00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:00,490
betrayer she got that name by doing

568
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:02,930
something and honestly if you think that

569
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,000
whatever God our deity or higher power

570
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,190
you're following if you think that there

571
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,519
isn't any potential that the same thing

572
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,789
could happen be foolish this is what

573
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,289
they do

574
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:16,849
there are good and kind ones but they're

575
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:20,460
never

576
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:22,740
they're not here for us I agree with you

577
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,630
hundred percent I'm disturbed by the

578
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,819
fact that there are good and kind ones

579
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:30,270
and that there are evil and cruel ones

580
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:34,139
to a god that should be nonsense all

581
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:37,079
those gods are meaningless to me I seek

582
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,750
the one who is so great that he does not

583
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:43,039
contain any of that none of those

584
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:46,470
components truly beyond understanding

585
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,589
and not petty like we seem to be where

586
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:53,539
one can go from favorite to betrayer and

587
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:56,059
maybe back again but back the other way

588
00:28:53,539 --> 00:29:01,670
that's what I'm that's what I'm seeking

589
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:04,889
oh love to hear more about your

590
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:10,500

middle of the room is this like dope a

694
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:18,909
snake exactly exactly

695
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:23,108
is it like a dagger yeah the kind of

696
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:25,119
curve comes out at the end okay so the

697
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:29,829
dagger the dagger itself is almost like

698
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,929
um like a blood channeled sacrificial

699
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:33,579
thing like a Chris oh yeah is that that

700
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,980
sort of lead leveland yeah that bizarre

701
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:38,289
sort of serpentine blade and you can see

702
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,679
that that sort of forms the last part of

703
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:43,480
the tail and then the torso

704
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,409
everything past the blade the hilt

705
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:51,668
itself is like the torso of a thoroughly

706
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:53,950
snaky a snake centaur

707
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:57,548

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:11,230
down yeah on the table lagari you can

711
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:15,699
feel the gotti like flex and tighten on

712
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:19,000
your neck you see it rises up you would

713
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:21,639
his first head is like this yeah turns

714
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:29,650
his head like this boy but he's trying

715
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:32,798
to he is engaged in some kind of pecking

716
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:36,760
order he's trying to establish a pecking

717
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:39,068
order with the dagger like a dominant

718
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,839
behavior yeah I know I yeah yeah it

719
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:44,108
looks like it looks like it's trying to

720
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:45,279
assert itself rearing up yeah yeah it

721
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,889
disturbs but it's like but it's

722
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,059
tightened up around the neck like it

723
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:53,348
you're not going to die

724
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:55,180
but it is he is definitely like trying

725
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:58,000
to do the gym thing like he's just

strikes like a like a lightning bolt

735
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:27,690
like as soon as he's down on the table

736
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:30,579
close to it when he can't pretend to

737
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,619
establish any kind of framework for

738
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:35,260
their interaction it becomes a it

739
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:38,530
becomes a battle he's playing the baby

740
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:41,740
so he strikes it and the dagger clatters

741
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:44,710
off of the table and strikes the stone

it has a language yeah yeah we're going

816
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:16,519
no idea is know when I'm in a beast like

817
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:18,529
like you could speak to it it is

818
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:20,690
literally an alien noodle right when I

819
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,940
yeah when I went out of your boy I gotta

820
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,460
voices it's not just you how I in the

821
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,190
same country with you how I use it so

822
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:33,199
generally you might be added nice for

823
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:34,519
you I don't I could take it hey you know

824
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,759
what I can't take control of it I can

825
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:39,739
look through it again but can i order it

826
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,330
yeah it's true oh yeah well let me let

827
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:45,139
me command it to put the knife down then

828
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:48,079
am I able to do that come on wait but it

829
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:52,789
gets a minute I guess it gets agitated

830
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:56,630
alright aye it does this guarding

831
00:40:52,789 --> 00:41:00,440
behavior and then it relinquishes the

832
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:02,510
knife but then it's sort of like circles

833
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,000
around it and now that it doesn't have a

834
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:08,599
grip on it it seems to think it needs to

835
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,219
assert itself okay we're back to one

836
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,510
essentially this could try and get it

837
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:13,509
again yeah I just didn't trust it oh

838
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:19,130
alright

839
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:21,709
are you able to check to your the thing

840
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,210
you need to do with this serve I'm just

841
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:26,108
trying to figure out like what its whole

842
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,059
deal is but this is fascinating

843
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:30,548
laughs I think it's I think it's a

844
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:33,989
snake's weapon I think it's in love with

845
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:37,599
it you equip it in your snake slot yeah

846
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:40,630
it's like a phase as once weapon is not

847
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,950
a lot of customizations do you want it

848
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,210
you wanted to spend some time with it

849
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:46,538
and trying to figure out what it is I

850
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,759
kind of I kind of won I kind of want

851
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:52,599
Locati to have it if he wants it

852
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:55,269

1006
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:52,340
is to be returned to her upon yet

1007
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,790

Scala not even a little bit so why on

1010
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,960
earth would we do that let me I was led

1011
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:09,440
off we tear that one up got taught or a

1012
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,929
month off okay works works work we

1013
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,000
shouldn't get on a gold piece of yeah

1014
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:14,989
yes the pains not great and you don't

1015
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,110
want to go

1016
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:21,279
so why wouldn't do it I have a

1017
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:27,849
proposition let's hear it

1018
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:31,250
what if we did security for the Horde

1019
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:34,009
for whatever time they determined that

1020
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:40,820
we need to do the security and then

1021
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:42,410
after that time is done we rob them well

1022
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,330
I was going to ask what are the yeah

1023
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:47,210
what are the victory conditions on both

1024
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:50,079
of these can we do both yeah yeah I

1025
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:52,400
think we should do that thing exactly

1026
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,190
hmm I would argue though that by

1027
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,320
planning to rob it even if we do

1028
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:59,900
security beforehand we actually are only

1029
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,780
robbing it we're not really doing the

1030
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,690
security but the security doesn't say

1031
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,680
against people stealing this gem I

1032
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:10,670
assumed taken forever

1033
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:12,199
yeah done this no okay yeah permanent

1034
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,700
security yes now it's our retainer

1035
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:15,559
situation why does no one touch the

1036
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:17,480
opticals right yeah it could be a thing

1037
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:19,880
where this gem is like passing through

1038
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,639
and we have to do security until it

1039
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,369
leaves again so we will have to both

1040
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,109
secure and steal securely it would be

1041
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:30,980
the ultimate way to case the joint

1042
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:35,050
exactly exactly when does a new Keturah

1043
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:37,880
in town yes well I mean everybody

1044
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:39,920
already joined I was incorporated for

1045
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,539
their own reasons and nobody was like

1046
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,340
I'm going to really do good for the

1047
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:46,730
world this is the organization for me

1048
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:49,190
right is it not a show exactly the good

1049
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:52,519
guys were they adventuring island of mr.

1050
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:55,369
toys yeah exactly we we should

1051
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:57,340
definitely find it the security and see

1052
00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:00,469
if we can find us that violet gem

1053
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:03,980
anything I would I would I agree with

1054
00:52:00,469 --> 00:52:06,559
that I would feel better from knew more

1055
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,159
about one party or the other just to

1056
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:12,079
just to contextualize it morally well we

1057
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:15,129
can ask we asked my beautiful if she

1058
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:20,869
knows anything about the noble knife oh

1059
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:23,119
sure sure sure yeah she's not in the

1060
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:24,829
open room right now she's in the back

1061
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,630
how could she

1062
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:27,449
miss popping in and out back there she's

1063
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,329
in gay

1064
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:33,358
some kind of task she because when she

1065
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:35,400
walks back out to the bar who sort of

1066
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,739
looks out the window see if anybody's

1067
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:42,389
coming waiting for someone

1068
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:44,159
no maybe I was going to ask her that

1069
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:46,558
yeah yeah wait are you waiting for

1070
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:50,179
someone Audra is supposed to be back

1071
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:56,329
today sometimes there are extensions

1072
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:59,219
she's she's in demand not just by me

1073
00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:02,700
well that's like give her a knowing nod

1074
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:04,019
and goes long trishul I'm sure she'll be

1075
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:07,739
back soon

1076
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:10,199
in the meantime no better way to pass

1077
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:12,419
the time than a little light

1078
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,199
conversation what do you know about the

she lassen she says I've been around for

1094
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:11,490
a while and I've heard there's a lot of

1095
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:17,068
organizations that call themselves

1096
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:22,348
things like that and typically the the

1097
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:25,579
truth is a bit of a bit away from it so

1098
00:54:22,349 --> 00:54:29,430

was really onto something with that name

1106
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:54,950
hmm

1107
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:58,789

something gotten there are a group of

1111
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:09,230
people who can do it

1112
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:11,149
that's a good name let me ask you this

1116
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,630
that's that's that's a way the way the

1117
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:25,459
river they travel on isn't far east from

1118
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:29,329
here but it's very hilly it'd be hard to

1119
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:33,800
go straight to it where are you supposed

1120
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:37,309

1121
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:41,930

long road for a waste sure one rare yeah

1124
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:49,480
once a once it starts to turn to the

1125
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,190
east you will pass the barge right in

1126
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,789
the very next town is Wong furred just

1127
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:58,059

and and papa I didn't have my snake for

1132
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:14,989

1133
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:19,069
comfort her I didn't have my snake for a

1134
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:23,109
while either but I was so relieved when

1135
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:25,670
I returned so and then just stood like a

1136
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,829
club to the back like ya know but it's

1137
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:31,820
just like I've made you feel better no

1138
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:34,340
but she she is accustomed even under

1139
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:37,190
ordinary circumstances to a dress like

1140
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:39,519
she is getting ready for war so you gave

1141
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:43,940
her pauldron a couple good Pat's

1142
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:46,340

1144
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:51,050
favorite treat should we get something

1145
00:56:48,289 --> 00:56:54,500
ready for her arrival

1146
00:56:51,050 --> 00:57:02,570
she's got expensive tastes I can work

1147
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:05,420
wonders negative she she says well here

1148
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:07,010
I'll go back and get the recipe and so

1149
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,920
she goes and she goes she goes back

1150
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:14,050
brings out a little like a tiny chest

1151
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:19,220
yay big opens it up it's full of Scrolls

1152
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:21,320
these are deeply in floured Scrolls

1153
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:23,239
I feel so comforted like the most

1154
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,019
grandma thank you really mean it exactly

1155
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:27,949
have no Tina

1156
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:30,559
exactly no it's just like egg like the

1157
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:32,539
bottom of the recipe is crisp yeah

1158
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,239
there's like doilies in there tradition

1159
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:37,219
is that like once it's gone too far and

1160
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:39,108
there's too many ingredients encrusting

1161
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:41,299
it you fry it and you eat it yeah

1162
00:57:39,108 --> 00:57:44,389
exactly Turkish coming all out there I

1163
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:48,830
mean aren't ready to go just meat it's

1164
00:57:44,389 --> 00:57:52,309
crisp like it's like a seal oh yeah all

1165
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:57,440
those layers of parchment um hey there

1166
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:58,699
is a from she says she says yes there

1167
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,700
will be something in here that she likes

1168
00:57:58,699 --> 00:58:06,129
but she has reached in and adjusted

1169
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:08,689
things a little bit so that wedding cake

1170
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:11,720
is sort of like at the top but like

1171
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:13,849
there's a little bit of plausible

1172
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:16,639
deniability because she has manipulated

1173
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:19,119
the chance matrix it's just like pilatus

1174
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:23,750
it's like something like one of these

1175
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:25,789
she likes all these I think okay these

1176
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:28,099
are all good ah dressings you can just

1177
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:29,659
you starting to get more and more sort

1178
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:33,109
of sort of flustered like this is a

1179
00:58:29,659 --> 00:58:36,019
tough-ass lady but around ah dress she's

1180
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:38,239
not hmm she loses a few points of AC

1181
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:40,759
which let's put it that way let's note

1182
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,919
that on the character yeah okay so uh

1183
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,839
Rosie notices the wedding cake and

1184
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:48,108
pulled it out and she's like well that's

1185
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:49,909
one of this right that's one of them no

1186
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,559

1204
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:35,630

1205
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:38,149

don't have to okay you don't have to pry

1261
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:32,880
for it you you know that there is a

1262
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:36,099
difference of opinion here between

1263
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:39,550
prophetess drawn and omen drawn right

1264
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:43,869
about auspicious right and out of

1265
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:47,620
character there's a I know that omen is

1266
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:50,789
on a quest to bring her back to life you

1267
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:53,679
got her on ice out around ice okay okay

1268
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:56,679
okay exactly but that's but that is not

1269
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:59,409
her that is not her perspective I see on

1270
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:01,349
the street but I still wrote you got my

1271
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:06,250
ice okay

1272
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:08,829
okay well we do a with your cake we do a

1273
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:11,230
cake yeah and it's beautifully frosted

1274
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:13,420
and we do a cake and it's waiting

1275
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:16,210
waiting for for Audrey's returns again

1276
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:20,650
in our dreams yeah and you guys are

1277
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:22,599
having those dreams and she just and

1278
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:25,028
then I was perfectly frosted she's just

1279
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:26,679
turning it slightly right mission

1280
01:03:25,028 --> 01:03:30,608
to find like angle she's trying to find

1281
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:34,019
that like awesome that that angle right

1282
01:03:30,608 --> 01:03:38,469
that will like bridge the gap between

1283
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:41,168
food and art perhaps a certain serving

1284
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:44,979
an angle right Park and I want to put my

1285
01:03:41,168 --> 01:03:46,629
arm on prophetess and probably like

1286
01:03:44,978 --> 01:03:50,318
lowest the lowest part of her arm

1287
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:53,979
because I'm very small and say sometimes

1288
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:58,028
I think you probably notice sometimes we

1289
01:03:53,978 --> 01:04:02,379
lose children but we can find children

1290
01:03:58,028 --> 01:04:06,358
in other people and in in situations

1291
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:11,099
that we didn't even know we could and so

1292
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:15,248
I hope that I hope that you have found

1293
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:16,900
you have found more people to love and

1294
01:04:15,248 --> 01:04:20,188

eyes conveying of

1322
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:42,880

no you're doing some fine I mean you're

1353
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:02,440
seeing and he is again there is a

1354
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:05,870
performative quality to the whole thing

1355
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:08,240
where have you ever I've never seen

1356
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:10,670
crabs yeah

1357
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:15,559
what I what are those tell about

1358
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:18,829
mythical DMZ classic beef where I see

1359
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:21,139
the rump have you ever seen crabs engage

1360
01:07:18,829 --> 01:07:24,980
in dominance behavior yeah it's

1361
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:28,129
ridiculous so fun yeah I think exactly

1362
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:30,050
but if it is a little dance and then one

1363
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:36,970
the cause is way too vague right now

1364
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:39,380
it's like hey mother what you

1365
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:41,179
want like the whole thing is just like

1366
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,039
this this bizarre dance and it's just

1367
01:07:41,179 --> 01:07:47,329
like that and then he occasionally

1368
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:49,009
invents new steps oh yeah no I about

1369
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:51,559
crabs not about a guy but like I think

1370
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:54,740
I'm right or a misremembering

1371
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:57,440
like that huge show claw doesn't have

1372
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:59,839
any like it's too big it's way too high

1373
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,829
the only thing or is doing this

1374
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,070
up

1375
01:08:00,829 --> 01:08:06,049
yeah I mean for us doing that up

1376
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:06,320
dance am i right yeah what's it all

1377
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:09,230

that like do we understand whether or

1386
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:35,088
not the can we do both of these jobs

1387
01:08:33,619 --> 01:08:36,170
yeah actually we should we should all

1388
01:08:35,088 --> 01:08:39,710
get on the same page the plane it's a

1389
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:41,180
scam um right scam I'm good yeah let's

1390
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,619
try to do both there if we only do one

1391
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:46,280
that we can't every job we only have to

1392
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:48,170
do one then we do the first one and then

1393
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:50,630
we're like yeah we're security and then

1394
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:52,220
we just steal it simply okay if we can't

1395
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,449
cash in on both at least said one thing

1396
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,159
we're playing an easy mode yeah yeah

1397
01:08:53,449 --> 01:08:56,798
good question

1398
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:59,180

marvelous once we get there so now we

1486
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:25,449
are underway I'm assuming yes Gulam so

1487
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:28,600
you're inside the best or the classic

1488
01:13:25,449 --> 01:13:31,329
scenario yes if you have a wrist robe

1489
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,060
and a dinar Blitzen within within and

1490
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:36,250
then you exact asleep by the way right

1491
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:39,640
okay an orange like Jesse goes like I

1492
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:41,560
wake up given a car too much but is

1493
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,450
there's never a moment where one of them

1494
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,370
is not snoring yes all right

1495
01:13:43,449 --> 01:13:47,439
I like the idea that they did with the

1496
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:49,750
eyes of the like you're sleeping but the

1497
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:51,099
eyes of the mushroom are like they act

1498
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:55,960
as though they can see what you're

1499
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:57,940
dreaming so it's a lot of like shaking

1500
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:00,250
and it just like you see like they're

1501
01:13:57,939 --> 01:14:02,529
round edge of the Hat like sort of turn

1502
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:06,659
into that like peanut smells like you

1503
01:14:02,529 --> 01:14:09,849
just yeah clamshell curious dismay yeah

1504
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:13,180
so but yeah is it are you in your

1505
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:17,920
classic zone loss on top up top which is

1506
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:20,890
ironic oh I'm serious or bottom did you

1507
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:23,079
guys not see like an Italian but what I

1508
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:25,390
was going to say was if we have to meet

1509
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:26,710
with two separate parties for these two

1510
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:29,920
separate jobs that make sense that we

1511
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:30,399
not like are completely separated but we

1512
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,779
just actually

1513
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:36,789
we don't know each other we split into

1514
01:14:31,779 --> 01:14:40,408
two you interface with the lizard folk

1515
01:14:36,789 --> 01:14:43,060
because you represent a kink and then

1516
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:46,329
the people who are not emblazoned with

1517
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:49,239
that logo could talk to the noble knight

1518
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:52,109
maybe maybe the folks who are generally

1519
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:55,569
associated with criminal underbelly Fifi

1520
01:14:52,109 --> 01:15:00,549

go with you here's my family one person

1522
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:04,989
to make contact as a robber it's true

1523
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:09,420
yeah there should be someone Shady

1524
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:14,198
yeah and maybe a little subtle yeah

1525
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:17,760

1558
01:16:45,289 --> 01:16:52,529

1560
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:57,869

1564
01:17:04,109 --> 01:17:08,729
once we get onto the hoard then you will

1565
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:10,380
sneak off and make contact with the new

1566
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:13,559
life yes I'm good

1567
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:15,239
also I just want to point out not naming

1568
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,630
any names are looking at anyone in

1569
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:22,829
particular but it says that they demand

1570
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:26,159
tasteful protection like a gleaming

1571
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:28,289
giant paladin faithful Sakura will be

1572
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:31,800
druid I've stared at the joint parting

1573
01:17:28,289 --> 01:17:34,439
mushroom yeah I enjoyed myself with well

1574
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:38,159
Frank about not showering she's kind of

1575
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:41,179
bragging you never talk price well as

1576
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:46,340
you are you are partitioning yourself

1577
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:51,900
into these groups functional task

1578
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:53,250
oriented subsections if you will that's

1579
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:55,500
the official name for them in the

1580
01:17:53,250 --> 01:18:00,600
document yeah yeah yeah obviously walnut

1581
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:05,250
knows you you know you you have you have

1582
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:10,289
been this for ourselves from read larch

1583
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:14,750
before one I know it was at that time it

1584
01:18:10,289 --> 01:18:19,199
was later in the evening of course it is

1585
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:22,590
getting late now it's a substantial draw

1586
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:26,039
away from red larch it's almost going to

1587
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:28,020
be time for you know maybe not maybe not

1588
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:30,090
a short rest maybe a long rest why and

1589
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:32,820
why not do we happen to see any kind of

1590
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:37,289
in you have to use it in fact in fact

1591
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:42,109
along the left just as you are rounding

1592
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:46,439
a corner you can see a sequence of

1593
01:18:42,109 --> 01:18:48,179
torches begin to light themselves up a

1594
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:51,599
path that you are well familiar with

1595
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:53,389
what color is the green flame obviously

1596
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:58,099
is leaping to life

1597
01:18:53,389 --> 01:19:00,918
on the torches and you can see that the

1598
01:18:58,099 --> 01:19:04,699
the gate is there in front as radiuses

1599
01:19:00,918 --> 01:19:07,550
that doone-gate in and then below in the

1600
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:14,418
most wretched handwriting you can

1601
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:17,630
imagine it says under new management you

1602
01:19:14,418 --> 01:19:21,918
got close so close proud of us what do

1603
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:24,529
you mean looks close I feel like what

1604
01:19:21,918 --> 01:19:26,809
they was writing like this what's the

1605
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:31,728
difference looks like I can read it you

1606
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:33,469
can read it it's not really letters all

1607
01:19:31,729 --> 01:19:35,989
right all right it's good places any

1608
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:37,550
yeah ten minutes make our picks out yeah

1609
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:39,978
maybe a friend of Woody's yeah it was

1610
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:43,449
the place huh so you work you roll up

1611

1984
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:09,699
chair inexplicably there's no real

1985
01:40:06,789 --> 01:40:19,060
reason to sit on the chair seated across

1986
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:21,069
from a skeleton an animated skeleton and

1987
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:24,430
they appear to be just talking to one

1988
01:40:21,069 --> 01:40:28,269
another idly good perception role from

1989
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:31,180
you sure I'll use this lovely die

1990
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:34,060
Oh whatever a lot of roll what am I it's

1991
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:38,619
what I'll call yeah exactly me I'd down

the whole thing yet so that's a no it's

1993
01:40:38,619 --> 01:40:45,489
trash is what it is it's a field give it

1994
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:48,460
to me it's a head bills whole numbers

1995
01:40:45,489 --> 01:40:50,559
and they sense now this number that one

1996
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:52,460
I can't even tell what skull looks like

1997
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,830
exactly so I can look at it

1998
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:58,020
already lips but all if you'd be another

1999
01:40:55,829 --> 01:40:59,969
this this there's something like me the

2000
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:03,480
conversation that they're having does

2001
01:40:59,969 --> 01:41:04,579
sound odd it sounds a little strange

2002
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:07,259
[Music]

2003
01:41:04,579 --> 01:41:10,050
does anybody else want to take a gander

2004
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:11,760
at this scenario there or is there

2005
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:13,500
anybody between us or is it like a

2006
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:21,090
straight shot it's a straight shot okay

2007
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:26,130
whoa you so when when the spider drops

2008
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:30,480
its massive sweater and it sort of sails

2009
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:32,819
down like a leaf it shifts itself on the

2010
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:37,409
chandelier and you can see just for a

2011
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:43,079
split second the contours around these

2012
01:41:37,409 --> 01:41:51,300
two illuminated so they are seated

2013
01:41:43,079 --> 01:41:53,760
inside of a transparent cube that

2014
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:56,390
shudders and wobbles slightly in

2015
01:41:53,760 --> 01:42:00,090
position okay I'm going to tap on it

2016
01:41:56,390 --> 01:42:02,340
nothing happens oh yeah yeah yeah it did

2017
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:04,650
it reacts like it's being tickled ah

2018
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:06,329
sort of pulls away a little bit and it

2019
01:42:04,649 --> 01:42:09,299
hurts the tip of your finger like it

2020
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:13,380
doesn't feel good to damage is that yes

2021
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:15,060
you're annihilated can you guys see when

2022
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:17,340
I tap on this can they see yeah yeah

2023
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:18,539
when she driving when she draws your

2024
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:22,770
attention to it you can see it

2025
01:42:18,539 --> 01:42:28,649
immediately they are suspended like some

2026
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:31,980
kind of like Easter treat but imagine a

2027
01:42:28,649 --> 01:42:37,289
depraved grandmother yeah making it a

2028
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:39,209

yeah yeah yeah look at that yes you see

2047
01:43:15,079 --> 01:43:29,309
between them on the table you see an urn

2048
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:32,820
that is more or less nondescript but

2049
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:35,820
they appear to be impressed with it and

2050
01:43:32,819 --> 01:43:39,210
they occasionally look over at your

2051
01:43:35,819 --> 01:43:43,250
drinking companion and then they look

2052
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:47,520
back and they literally high-five over

2053
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:49,649
this urn I literally do that they really

2054
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,880

01:43:54,659 --> 01:43:58,079
it's like it's like you don't know how

2059
01:43:56,250 --> 01:44:02,329
long it took them to practice this heat

2060
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:07,069
but a ghost and a skeleton can high-five

2061
01:44:02,329 --> 01:44:09,930
now we know yeah be okay I have one

2062
01:44:07,069 --> 01:44:12,479
corner if you might believe let me say

01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:18,840
this matrix ministry let me tell you

2064
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:22,019
some creative amazing things about I

2065
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:27,779

there the cube the membrane so clean

2067
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:31,500
that's probably the cleanest one I've

2068
01:44:29,729 --> 01:44:34,589
ever seen you can even see it right away

2069
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:40,319
it's all it's all acid he looks back

2070
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:42,390
it's just it's like a acid monster but

2071
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:44,729
even it lays pretty clean in there but

2072
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:47,460
it's still as well even the suspension

2073
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:52,619
is pretty tight I'm glad that you like

2074
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:55,050

01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:41,230
has been reduced is there a way that we

2088
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:43,510
could win back your factory friend if

2089
01:45:41,229 --> 01:45:46,449
you fought up if you want to play

2090
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:50,800
against them if you want to if you want

2091
01:45:46,449 --> 01:45:55,300

same way that you might look in the

2099
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:28,180
glass window of a shop

2100
01:46:23,529 --> 01:46:31,329

01:46:31,329 --> 01:46:37,569
he gets as he gets close you see the

2103
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:41,160

if you haven't played it I it's been a

2183
01:50:58,219 --> 01:51:05,149
long time I can give the necklace to

2184
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:07,430
bliss I ever use those big paws but I've

2185
01:51:05,149 --> 01:51:09,019
never played I would love to see it yeah

2186
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:10,550
let's let's get let's go ahead and get

2187
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:13,670
some rules all right

2188
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:17,390
lesson I have business later you are the

2189
01:51:13,670 --> 01:51:21,649
halflings plural right okay but you're

2190
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:22,640
also the halflings in the game okay you

2191
01:51:21,649 --> 01:51:25,099
have to halflings

2192
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:27,920
those are your dice either my halfling

2193
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:30,890
those are your halflings okay i have the

2194
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:34,430
giant okay your halflings have six sides

2195
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:37,850
right the giant has ten sides right okay

2196
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:39,770
and if you so far yeah if the giant

2197
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:43,160
rolls of one think of to think of 1

2198
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:46,040
through 10 as the Giants body okay right

2199
01:51:43,159 --> 01:51:48,710
your halflings have to try to hit my

2200
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:51,969
knee okay that's how you win all right

2201
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:54,170
but if I ever roll a one you lose oh

2202
01:51:51,969 --> 01:51:57,590
that's called the kick okay

2203
01:51:54,170 --> 01:52:00,350
okay I'm gonna roll the dice for example

2204
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:01,760
this time I got a one okay that will

2205
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:04,010
kick you Milo you automatically lose

2206
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,510
automatically lose okay now that was

2207
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:10,219
also one let me try again

2208
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:13,659
let me get a different dice a - okay

2209
01:52:10,219 --> 01:52:14,779
this is great great all you have to do a

2210
01:52:13,659 --> 01:52:19,369
sling

2211
01:52:14,779 --> 01:52:23,359
yeah is roll higher than a two-on-two

2212
01:52:19,369 --> 01:52:26,090
dice so is that a 3 or higher or a 2 or

2213
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:29,238
higher it could be a 2 okay it can't be

2214
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:32,390
a - okay seems highly likely on both of

2215
01:52:29,238 --> 01:52:34,968
them yeah oh I'm both died that's right

2216
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:37,100
okay well I gotta go three six now in

2217
01:52:34,969 --> 01:52:41,359
this case you would win now because I

2218
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:43,579
rolled a two yeah knees that are set at

2219
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:45,380
two or three pay one to one so if you

2220
01:52:43,579 --> 01:52:48,529
gave me a hundred gold right now you

2221
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:51,469
have 200 gold C right okay if the me is

2222
01:52:48,529 --> 01:52:54,409
four to six that pays two to one okay if

2223
01:52:51,469 --> 01:52:56,480
the knee is seven to nine that pays

2224
01:52:54,409 --> 01:52:59,389
three to one and if the knee is ten god

2225
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:02,059
help you yeah because that's very hard

2226
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:04,880
to roll on - halflings hep does seem

2227
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:08,330
impossible to roll it is very hard but

2228
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:10,850
it does pay five to one okay now there

2229
01:53:08,329 --> 01:53:14,600
is something else okay if you roll

2230
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:17,390
higher than I can roll on a d-10 on my

2231
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:17,929
10-sided dice here the giant right 11 or

2232
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:21,039
12

2233
01:53:17,929 --> 01:53:25,190
that's the mall the giant eats you up

2234
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:27,529
okay we're too high okay now there's one

2235
01:53:25,189 --> 01:53:33,619
more rule that you need to know right

2236
01:53:27,529 --> 01:53:37,670
okay if you hit the knee exactly you can

2237
01:53:33,619 --> 01:53:39,590
double your bet take your dice split

2238
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:42,529
them into two and roll one additional

2239
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:46,069
dice for each one interesting and try to

2240
01:53:42,529 --> 01:53:46,279
get your money that way okay fun all

2241
01:53:46,069 --> 01:53:48,500
right

2242
01:53:46,279 --> 01:53:49,819
and I may split a second time if I wish

2243
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:52,880
to become legend you wish to become

2244
01:53:49,819 --> 01:53:56,029
legendary yes you can split the dice

2245
01:53:52,880 --> 01:54:01,659
again if you hit the knee again Wow

2246
01:53:56,029 --> 01:54:04,250
okay what about a third time yes what

2247
01:54:01,658 --> 01:54:07,388
it's unlikely we'll cross that bridge

2248
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:10,340
when we get to it now to be very clear I

2249
01:54:07,389 --> 01:54:14,328
want to make sure it's not this if their

2250
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:16,369
knees - I don't have to roll like boat

2251
01:54:14,328 --> 01:54:18,859
this is this is a six yeah you can deep

2252
01:54:16,368 --> 01:54:20,839
not ten threes you know he said

2253
01:54:18,859 --> 01:54:22,609
something if you're if you're value add

2254
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:24,739
to add up your halfling right they are

2255
01:54:22,609 --> 01:54:27,049
higher than any didn't also be fine I'm

2256
01:54:24,738 --> 01:54:29,598
you win okay I have you win now great

2257
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:30,349
there's also there's also one more rule

2258
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:35,420
okay

2259
01:54:30,349 --> 01:54:39,619
if you roll two ones yeah a snake scares

2260
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:39,980
away the giant okay okay you keep your

2261
01:54:39,618 --> 01:54:45,670
bets

2262
01:54:39,979 --> 01:54:50,029

civilized world

2266
01:54:53,210 --> 01:55:01,809

2267
01:54:56,539 --> 01:55:05,630

2268
01:55:01,809 --> 01:55:07,699

2292
01:56:07,789 --> 01:56:12,828
take a little one young D all right

2293
01:56:09,969 --> 01:56:15,050
before you never know what makes you to

2294
01:56:12,828 --> 01:56:17,119
want if you don't try one

2295
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:20,659
now you never know when you're going to

2296
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:22,670
need to know Giants and halflings that's

2297
01:56:20,659 --> 01:56:24,139
true you never know when you might need

2298
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:25,880
to know it and now we know there's

2299
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:29,270
places there's places where people use

2300
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:31,039
this to solve all kinds of problems I'm

2301
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:33,260
so glad we know have you ever heard of

2302
01:56:31,039 --> 01:56:35,439
pickpocket uh I don't think so

2303
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:40,100
no tick pockets a Thieves Guild game

2304
01:56:35,439 --> 01:56:43,059
right uh same dice slightly different

2305
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:44,990
rules better odds for the house

2306
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:46,490
generally speaking people think of

2307
01:56:44,989 --> 01:56:49,869
Giants and halflings as a friendly game

2308
01:56:46,489 --> 01:56:54,349
okay it's not friendly this time proof

2309
01:56:49,869 --> 01:56:54,859
but again it is you fight you free hate

2310
01:56:54,350 --> 01:56:57,620
that guy

2311
01:56:54,859 --> 01:57:02,509
but generally speaking explain among

2312
01:56:57,619 --> 01:57:05,960
friends okay 10 2010 your money in big

2313
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:08,659
money but but I have to roll exactly a

2314
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:11,750

world other than air so there could be a

2350
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:35,280
situation where you should be a

2351
01:58:33,719 --> 01:58:39,208
situation where you have to constantly

2352
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:43,768

bet on a tortured child let's let's

2583
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:04,390
definitely do that we're not the most

2584
02:10:02,229 --> 02:10:06,549
popular with the police and then

2585
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:08,079
particulars down so I think we probably

02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:18,580
help a child and even if it's like

2589
02:10:15,939 --> 02:10:20,139
tortured like maniac who's presenting as

2590
02:10:18,579 --> 02:10:21,850

2630
02:11:53,800 --> 02:12:00,090
like a sack of gym so you just see the

2631
02:11:56,198 --> 02:12:02,589
eyes of the spider just looking down and

2632
02:12:00,090 --> 02:12:06,150
then you see the light glinting off of

2633
02:12:02,590 --> 02:12:10,900
them and then you see her four legs

2634
02:12:06,149 --> 02:12:13,960
reach out and grab a little figurine the

2635
02:12:10,899 --> 02:12:15,399
golden figurine that she drops down so

2636
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:17,770
sort of weaves like a little noose

2637
02:12:15,399 --> 02:12:22,059
around it and it drops down if you think

2638
02:12:17,770 --> 02:12:23,199
it's a comparable gold weight okay you

2639
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:27,940
guys just went double or nothing

2640
02:12:23,198 --> 02:12:31,448
yeah I'm gonna ride that okay my my

2641
02:12:27,939 --> 02:12:34,388
compatriot is extremely learning in

2642
02:12:31,448 --> 02:12:35,948
these arts very familiar with sup with

2643
02:12:34,389 --> 02:12:37,810
items of the occult things that might

2644
02:12:35,948 --> 02:12:40,149
interest you he has an interesting

2645
02:12:37,810 --> 02:12:43,780
proposition yeah I'm down the rest of my

2646
02:12:40,149 --> 02:12:48,429
drink some I feel sure right so I and I

2647
02:12:43,779 --> 02:12:51,039
snap my fingers and I have sent velvet

2648
02:12:48,429 --> 02:12:53,109
out invisibly to retrieve the the

2649
02:12:51,039 --> 02:12:55,868
crystal ball from the cart so it's sort

2650
02:12:53,109 --> 02:13:01,420
so it floats in my can i grab it i go

2651
02:12:55,868 --> 02:13:02,738
for haha impress that now that's because

2652
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:04,630
the ball has many properties but the

2653
02:13:02,738 --> 02:13:07,988
only one that we're certain of is that

2654
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:10,840
it will permit a view of outside if

2655
02:13:07,988 --> 02:13:16,059
you're retired just boring old in

2656
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:21,099
imagine beyond yes do you know how long

2657
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:22,330
it takes for us to get anywhere I see

2658
02:13:21,099 --> 02:13:24,489
we're going to go somewhere whether you

2659
02:13:22,329 --> 02:13:28,090
enjoy it in there no I believe you and I

2660
02:13:24,488 --> 02:13:30,549
support this bet fantastic I think this

2661
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:33,969
is a ball that does more than I said but

2662
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:39,579
okay yeah I have tactical powers never

2663
02:13:33,969 --> 02:13:40,899
gone with the skull they sing yeah I

2664
02:13:39,579 --> 02:13:42,309
