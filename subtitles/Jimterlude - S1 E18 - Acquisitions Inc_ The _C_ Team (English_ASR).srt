00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,680
one of the desk drawers and sets it on

98
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,649
the table he looks down and he says

this guy and he gets his whole family

313
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:26,000
wizard's robe he's got his kids and his

314
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,739

315
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,899
you yeah we don't wanna be in line we

316
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,000
want to go we need to yeah there's like

317
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:35,059
a long gap between me and the difference

318
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,159
I just create a crowd for Celina yeah I

319
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,649
know what partha all right usually I

320
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,990
roll a history check yep figure out

321
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:44,419
where we are 13 there darlin you cannot

322
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,209
discern where you are the the it's

323
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:49,129
daytime you can't really see any stars

324
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,809
but nothing around you looks especially

325
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,370
noteworthy there's no landmarks or

326
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,559
anything like that it's just a wide-open

327
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,350
field there's this tower that reaches up

328
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,000
it's going through the clouds and it's

329
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,060
ringed by this wall you think that

330
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,649
Wizards sort of like to have their

331
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:05,509
residents in their own little pockets

332
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,659
sometimes this might not even be

333
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:11,120
anywhere specific to the Material Plane

334
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:13,370
we need to find this service entrance

335
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,679

498
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,590
the circle yeah you can feel yourself

499
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,360
being teleported you're sort of lifted

500
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:52,549
up into the air and and when you appear

501
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,740
in this new area you're on a raise Dyess

502
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:57,230
with a sort of ramp that leads down and

503
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,750
you are lifted you're rising up above it

504
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,610
and magical sort of tendrils are weaving

505
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,839
all around you and after a couple

506
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:05,990
seconds you realize that they're

507
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:10,129
actually weaving a little cart and it's

508
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:17,000
got four wheels and it looks something

509
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:18,620
like this haha Oh fancy wood paneling

510
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,089
down the side there's a car seat in the

511
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:25,789
back and it sets down onto the Dyess and

512
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:28,419
you sort of roll down the ramp and you

513
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:32,089
can see that your what looks like a

514
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:34,340
checkered line and you and your cart

515
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:36,980

527
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:09,099

00:22:57,099 --> 00:23:03,428
I'm going to kill you you go through the

549
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,308
portal pretty normal what looks like a

550
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:07,780
little cart appears around you and you

551
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:09,639
look down and you can see that they're

552
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:12,670
all the little carts and there's what

553
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,920
obviously is some sort of race setup and

554
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,929
I this is [ __ ] and you punch your

555
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,789
legs through the bottom of the cart

556
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,850
and you hoist it up around your waist

557
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:28,299
you know I'm faster than a car accurate

558
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:30,279
Oh God the leg ease the my leg you see

559
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:32,529
stick the light there you are down in a

560
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,990
very dark done part you can see the path

561
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:36,910
before you is very dimly lit and you

562
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,140
hear magical voice amplified through

563
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:43,500
this dungeon say prepare yourselves for

564
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,500
wizard card

565
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,400
I don't I don't play Dungeons and

566
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,350
Dragons like normal people I guess what

567
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,230
I've done is I've in a game that uses

568
00:23:56,349 --> 00:24:01,449
sometimes dragons rules to recreate a

569
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,009
game like you've never seen before

570
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,920
yeah I remember you've never seen

571
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:07,930
anything like this no I guarantee it

572
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,390
what the [ __ ] have you done this is what

573
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,460
I do great season

574
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,740
like I hope so cuz I work really hard on

575
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,420
it yeah now I'm going to explain some

576
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,870
very basic rules to you because I'm some

577
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,840
very big never played anything like this

578
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:23,769
on your turn go fast you want to go as

579
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:28,509
fast as you can

580
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:32,829
your speed is your character speed + 1

581
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:34,839
d6 ok so divide your speed by 5 to

582
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:38,679
figure out how many spaces you get to

583
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:39,819
move ok well it should be easy and

584
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,000
you're going to your speed is going to

585
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:46,269
be that plus a decent yep I'm going to

586
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,759
disobey everyone keep everyone guys

587
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:52,059
normal right 35 you cannot move

588
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:54,279
diagonally ok and you cannot move

589
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:56,740
through other racers ok

590
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:58,629
if you pass over one of these question

591
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,109
marks mm-hmm you will draw a weapon

592
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:04,750
spell ok if you are in 1st through 3rd

593
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:06,969
place if you are in last place when you

594
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,150
pass over one you will draw from this

595
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:12,370
stack which is heavily weighted to get

596
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,600
you out of last place man you even did

597
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:18,819
the rubber banding I don't know what

598
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:21,279
you're talking I know each of you has a

599
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:23,829
little card yeah yeah on it you see that

600
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,710
you have an AC of 14 everybody has the

601
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:29,439
same Kart AC and you have a Kart power

602
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,569
that is unique to each of you so why we

603
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,340
go around the table you can read your

604
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:37,200
Kart power and I'll break it down for

605
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:39,699
you if you have any questions walnut

606
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,620
vine whip once per turn you may swap

607
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:46,150
places with a player within 3 spaces of

608
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:48,039
you watch your head Wow

609
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,600
Big Daddy you may move through other

610
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,730
racers when you do their move back one

611
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:52,929
space

612
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,849
nobody else can move through but you've

613
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,259
got a special cart power lets you go

614
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:56,679
right through people tip you out of my

615
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:00,190
way

616
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,500
sorry Rosie shadow step once per turn

617
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:05,110
you may move one space

618
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,960
really yeah so that's very helpful for

619
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:10,418
cutting corners getting around people

620
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,909
super useful highways RIS I have arcane

621
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:16,929
knowledge my hand sizes too when I would

622
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:18,419
draw a card draw up to two normally you

623
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:21,330
guys can only have one spell at a time

624
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:24,640
Chris just to have two spells that's

625
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:27,730
good yeah but on your turn you get to

626
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,500
move and you can action which is playing

627
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,750
a spell or making some other kind of

628
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,730
check there's things to explore in this

629
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,159
dungeon and also if you guys have ideas

630
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,740

sure do let me know and I will

632
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:49,089
adjudicate them on a surface by case

633
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:54,058
basis all right now ideally we're going

634
00:26:49,089 --> 00:27:03,089

alright okay and then I'm going to hover

1326
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:32,029
all and I want to use my advantage on

1327
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:34,339
this roll okay which I have I do so

1328
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:37,220
you're going to roll two dice and take

1329
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:41,269
the best one I am so we're moving one of

1330
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:45,679
your advantage roll that was a four not

1331
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:48,920
bad spending a while shoot then I get

1332
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:51,589
ten of these bad boys right one two

1333
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,570
three four five six

1334
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:56,059
you can also see this blue schedule now

1335
00:58:53,570 --> 00:59:01,130
but she did the action all right

1336
00:58:56,059 --> 00:59:05,028
yeah she didn't care about magic yes

1337
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:09,108
okay oh this is a discard and that was

1338
00:59:05,028 --> 00:59:11,719
my turn all right Chris thank how much

1339
00:59:09,108 --> 00:59:13,608
of a I don't have any line of sight can

1340
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:14,208
I do a check on that sigil yeah

1341
00:59:13,608 --> 00:59:15,498
absolutely

1342
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:17,478
you can shave from my yard all right

1343
00:59:15,498 --> 00:59:21,409
Arkana what do you want to do let me do

1344
00:59:17,478 --> 00:59:24,948
in our camp okay if I may yeah all right

1345
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:27,679
I guess is that a roll yeah as 14:14 is

1346
00:59:24,949 --> 00:59:32,989
good no yeah you recognize that this is

1347
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:34,759
a sort of magical activator and that it

1348
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:38,929
probably opens up a secret passageway

1349
00:59:34,759 --> 00:59:41,568
I keep that now and now is now that you

1350
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:43,969
understand its workings you believe that

1351
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:45,619
were you to drive sort of into it it

1352
00:59:43,969 --> 00:59:50,179

you just we're not helping them the car

1388
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,800
now takes up these four spaces okay and

1389
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:30,800
they're difficult terrain so if you move

1390
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:34,220
into them you be going one two three

1391
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,900
four five oh six seven it costs more to

1392
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:37,009
move through those spaces as soon as

1393
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,940
it's hit as soon as somebody moves

1394
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:41,180
through it it goes away

1395
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:44,420
okay well so you're just gonna leave

1396
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:46,159
that there on the track nice did you

1397
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:48,260
take an action I guess you did you

1398
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:49,579
investigated this deal yep and you know

1399
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:52,070
how it works now yes

1400
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:54,739
yeah but and I did all mine so it's

1401
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:57,620
who's after me it's Rosie Rosie okay I

1402
01:01:54,739 --> 01:01:58,639
want to investigate this a deal um but I

1403
01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:02,839
don't have good Arkana

1404
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:04,639
we used inside dad oh it has to be our

1405
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:09,950
can well can't you make me a perception

1406
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:11,779
check okay garbage day said no way I'm

1407
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:15,159
gonna need the bans on this too okay

1408
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:21,200
yeah so that's what good thing

1409
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:22,549
Big Mike won a yeah so looking now back

1410
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:26,059
it's over the central you can see the

1411
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:28,280
wall behind it is is in shadow but where

1412
01:02:26,059 --> 01:02:29,389
you thought it was stone you can

1413
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,500
actually see that it really is just

1414
01:02:29,389 --> 01:02:33,289
shadow

1415
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,940
there's nothing material there and you

1416
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:36,199
believe that were you to drive into it

1417
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,389
you would probably just keep continuing

1418
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:40,279
through some sort of passage excellent

1419
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:42,049
if you don't mind me jumping on top here

1420
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:46,370
I'm going to role play it such that my

1421
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:50,210
car told you okay that's good secret

1422
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:51,259
wall oh god what found your car felt bad

1423
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:54,650
sweets I'm in last place

1424
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:56,390
no okay she's a Jill over there let me

1425
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,860
tell you about it good long look at that

1426
01:02:56,389 --> 01:02:59,629
one alright so I know if it's a glyph

1427
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,370
for sigil to figure that out digital

1428
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:03,380
unique so it's definitely said Jill yeah

1429
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:04,880
okay um so I'm just going to do my

1430
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,440

there's this trough of sewage flowing

1549
01:09:00,579 --> 01:09:03,729
through the center of the dungeon here

1550
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:05,529
and it disappears into a grate in the

1551
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:06,909
floor here you believe that were you to

1552
01:09:05,529 --> 01:09:07,569

1553
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:10,000
difficult

1554
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:12,339
yeah and probably take maybe twice as

1555
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,798
many spaces to move through hmm looks

1556
01:09:12,338 --> 01:09:15,519
like difficult terrain over there maybe

1557
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:17,500
